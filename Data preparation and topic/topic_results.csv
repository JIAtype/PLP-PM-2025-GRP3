Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfHtiJwiepCu_qwONFRaS06p,ZLKh8w3SGr0,the summary of this entire drive is this car is way better than it has any right to be i love new cars there's something about thinking about the engineers and designers sitting in a room together with a clean sheet of paper and building something from nothing and then there's new car companies companies tesla rivian and lucid with their own vision of what the future of the automobile should look and then there's this new cars from new car companies from new countries that never made cars before we're in vietnam with vinfast to look at this so this then is a look at the future of a car made from a country that didn't really make cars before and today wanna see if this is any good this is the vf8 and this is fully charged fully charged live is coming to california this september 10th and 11th powered by electrify america get your tickets to the number one ev and home energy show now [music] vinfast intends to bring its electric car models to the u.s market this year and has plans in place to have the factory in north carolina up and running by 2024 where it will build cars and batteries and before you rule them out as just another new car brand that will never make it to mass market production you should know that vinfast is bankrolled by vietnam's largest conglomerate the vin group a colossal company with fingers in just about every pie you can imagine there are vin homes vin schools vin universities and an all-electric vin buses vinsmart manufactures mobile phones vin ai are specialist in machine learning there are even vin wonder amusement parks it's a big company and one renowned for making its goals happen fast so the vin fast vf8 we're here in beautiful vietnam to check this thing out so why is this car important well this is vietnam's first foray into electric vehicles and they've come out swinging with two models that i think are just perfect for the american market crossover suvs this the vf8 and i think the better looking bigger brother the vf9 but we'll talk about the vf8 here today so in terms of styling they actually went with pen and farina the guys that made a lot of the ferraris you know and love and one of my favorite cars growing up the acura honda nsx so styling is is quite nice i think in terms of the look it looked a lot a lot of the other crossovers i see in this space it's got good front fascia this is the kind of standard vin fast grill and design language it carries through pretty much throughout the entire car so out here we have aero wheels which is good right because fun fact the biggest deterrent to range in an ev is actually the wheels so they've got that covered come along here pretty well sculpted little design around the bottom quarter panel and along the back it kind of looks a porsche maycon or something that good good styling all the way around and i think the back is particularly striking personally because they've got again the vin fast design language the segmented tail light design a little spoiler on the back and all around just a generally good package look it's a crossover suv you've seen them before this is not really all that new generally i think it's well designed and i mentioned before the real looker in the family is the vf9 which i think looks fantastic but the vf8 the little brother also i think is a as a solid good family eevee choice in terms of styling [music] so this is the interior of the vf8 and again just a really overall good package the vin fast v design language kind of runs out here in the front as well good soft touch up in here it's a little bit hard touch there and here but i'd say it's kind of a middle of the pack mid luxury section car maybe a higher pointed raft for maybe a lowly appointed acura rdx something that in that range but all this is really nice soft touch good space for things and a really nice size landscape infotainment screen one of the more striking design choices is this gear shifter which kind of looks a lamborghini in terms of the layout but that's kind of cool cup holders right there your music controls are kind of mazda style right here at your fingertips which i the steering wheel is on the thinner side if i'm honest but it does get meteor right where you're supposed to grab it and uh the touch buttons are all really nicely laid out as well no capacitive touch here which i personally don't care for you've got stocks and everything else let's jump in the back seat and see how that fares so i'm right about six feet tall and i have the front seat positioned pretty much where i would be i might be a couple inches further back but you can see the legroom in the back is cavernous and headroom is quite similar as well at six feet i think you'll have no problems now if you're just a giant jack at six five or six six well maybe it might be closer but honestly i think for most people more than enough room back here good layout of charging ports for usb charging you've got vents back here speakers in the door good deep pockets here on the door and you've also got cup holders and no storage but a little arm rest for the back overall i think well laid out the interesting choice is lack of a panoramic roof which i feel every ev has now and i don't know that i care too much but if that matters to you you're going to notice that uh yeah that's kind of absent in this car love to wait and see if maybe other models for north american markets introduce that we mentioned before this is a vietnamese version so things might change a little bit by the time you get them where you live [music] [applause] [music] [music] so let's talk about expectations what this car is and what this car isn't this is not a performance suv this is not a porsche macon equivalent right this is a family cruiser and as a family cruiser it's really competent i would say this car is better than it has any right to be this is then fast first ev and we've all been making cars for a couple of years in general gas cars before this and all that being said they kind of nailed it it's a it's exactly what you'd expect it to be comfortable body roll is is pretty good again it's a bigger suv but because that battery pack is on the floor it doesn't feel your typical suv the closest comparison i would draw to is probably a volkswagen id4 the seats are really comfortable which adds to the general feel in here as well this is one of those cars i think you definitely need to go out and check for yourself because i think it just does a good job of being versatile and all around competent and the suspension is really plush and comfortable the roads here in vietnam especially on this test course were fantastic and smooth which we can't say the same for in southern california where we live but i think this would be one of those cars that would be a great road tripping car there's two variants that will be shipped into the u.s both will have dual motors the eco model will have 248 horsepower and the plus model will have 402 so more than capable cars and if you need that all-wheel drive all the cars for the us i believe are going to be dual motor and maybe in the future benfast can offer a performance boost option or something and dial in performance even further kind what tesla does with their non-performance models because i would probably pay a couple grand for that this car has more than enough power i think they've they've aired on the side of being smooth right if you map the throttle very aggressively every time you lift and pick up your your right foot the car will be very jerky and so they've gone for a much more refined kind of a ride but i the performance i would personally probably dial it up as high as i could because i just that instantaneous feel right it's electric motors and we we have that we have that option one of the other really cool things about this car it's kind of unexpected and kind of above and beyond what they needed to do i think to deliver on their first car is really intuitive home automation control so i'm not sure which protocols and what standards and what products they'll talk to but they plan on allowing you to be able to control your thermostat at home and do cool things where you could set the temperature before you arrive turn off lights open your garage check the garage status things that that's that's going to be a cool touch and it all happens here on the infotainment screen so we mentioned one of the really amazing things when new car companies and new countries do cars for the first time is they bring their own unique perspectives and takes and i've never seen any other ev company bring this much attention to home automation and connectivity and having your car be kind of the central hub for your connected world and that's i think the greatest thing about the vent fast story is you get new engineers and new product owners new people with new ideas which will kind of drive the entire industry forward otherwise you have the same five or six companies in the same three or four countries and uh after a while you're going to get stagnant right so that's really the coolest part about this [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] really quickly also one of the things i'm really impressed with is how zippy the ui and the screen of the infotainment system is in the future this car will come with android auto and apple carplay via software update over the air once they have their certifications which i think will be a great touch for people who are looking for that it's the kind of car that you would expect from an automaker who's been making cars for a long time and the kind of car that you're impressed when someone just kind of nails on their first take one of the coolest features i found is that heads up display which is i wish every car had it i don't know why they don't it just feels well thought out that's the best thing i can say about it it's just what you'd expect that's exactly what i love about this car [music] [applause] now there's not a lot of details about charging speeds but it does support level one two and three charge door is here and you've got your j1772 and your ccs fast charging ports as well [music] [applause] [applause] so this vent isn't just a new car it's not just a new car company it's a new car from new car company in a new country and their vision of what the future of mobility will look between new cars new concepts and a battery subscription model they think they might just have the answer for more and more car buyers to buy electric vehicles over gas cars are they right well time will tell don't forget to hit that button and and if you have been thank you so much for watching,2
Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfHtiJwiepCu_qwONFRaS06p,7LMgmg0I0GA,electric cars depending on who you ask they're either the future or the devil a vital tool in our mission to net carbon neutrality or a can of worms that creates as many problems as they solve i've often joked that nothing makes otherwise disinterested people become environmentalists quicker than talking about solar panels or electric cars your ev is just a coal powered car that's a fun one or think about all the ecological devastation mining for battery materials causes hmm weird i always thought fossil fuels had to be drilled and fracked then refined using gobs of electricity then transported sometimes thousands of miles only to be burnt for an instant of value but that's not what we're talking about today no today we're talking about one of my favorites the question of whether our aging grid here in the us could even cope with a world full of electric vehicles is mass ev adoption even possible here in the united states with our existing infrastructure or will the increased demand for electricity caused by a growing popularity of electric cars our grid and leave us all living an amish lifestyle spoiler alert no i'm ricky and this is for the church looking for some sunshine and clean air well we're better than southern california this september we're bringing all of the electric vehicles under the sun and an array of clean technologies to america's finest city this fall yes that's right fully charged live usa powered by electrify america is coming to san diego so for fresh perspectives exhilarating test rides electrifying live talks and all of your favorite youtubers get your tickets today [music] now it's no secret the us grid does struggle from time to time i mean we get brown out warnings when it's a bit warm outside and the utilities know people will be running their air conditioners so there's no way we can charge all these evs right right to answer that let's look at the numerous challenges of operating an electrical grid a rather unenviable task if we compare electricity to other utilities piped into your home you'll quickly start to see the challenge and while we're even talking about this water and natural gas are plumbed into your homes and pressurized in the case of water usually around 50 to 80 psi if you don't need water right now no problem the pumps and water towers keep that pressure built up ready for when you need it you can source water whenever you want store it and just let consumers use it as needed but this isn't the case with electricity you can't just pipe in electricity and wait for when it might be needed that's because electricity needs to be created and consumed pretty much instantaneously create too much and you need to curtail it or basically waste it create too little and you can get voltage sags possibly damage sensitive equipment and eventually get brown outs or strategic power cuts made to certain regions to protect the larger grid if we look at electricity consumption in the united states since the 1950s you'll see a pretty dramatic trend our thirst for electricity is massive and climate from retail sales of electricity of about 0.3 trillion kilo dollars in 1950s to nearly 4 trillion kilo dollars or 3 900 terawatt hours by 2020 but here's the crazy part the percentage of the electricity used for transportation currently is a negligibly tiny sliver and this is at the heart of the argument that if we start adding tons of electricity usage to electric cars to an aging and already taxed grid surely it can't cope according to the federal highway administration americans drive roughly 3.2 trillion miles a year to convert every single one of those miles to electric and assuming an average ev efficiency of 3 miles per kilowatt hour a tesla model x that means we'd need about one trillion killed hours of electricity so yearly consumption would go from four trillion kilowatt hours to five a 25 percent increase put one way we could make all cars evs tomorrow for just 25 more electricity but put another way we need one trillion kilo hours of electricity but it might not even be that bad jack recently did an episode on aptera a truly new rethink of what a vehicle can be we'll put a link in the description but an aptera can travel about 10 miles per kilowatt hour and if we all drove around in evs that efficient the increased demand on the grid would be cut by two-thirds because of course the more efficient electric car the less additional electricity we need plus with solar panels it's possible you'd never need to charge an aptera at all i really want to see efficiency getting more attention in modern electric car design not just because it can reduce our electricity demand but because efficient evs are just better and cheaper to run another consideration that hardly ever gets brought up during these conversations is about grid demand and how much electricity oil refineries consume each year according to the u.s energy information administration in 2021 oil refineries alone used nearly 43 billion killed hours of electricity not to mention nearly 1 trillion cubic feet or 28.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas and all sorts of other fuels but who's counting some estimates even place the true electricity consumption of the whole life cycle of gasoline not just refineries at closer to 100 billion kilowatts per year that's nearly one-tenth of all the electricity we would need for a hundred percent evs so getting rid of those would be a great start but we'll still need to find a bit more energy so let's take a look at the u.s power usage over a 24 hour period you have probably heard this referred to as the duck curve see it kind of looks a cute little duck but in the age of solar power we have a bit of a problem when the sun shines you see what happens to energy demand it falls dramatically during the day then peaks at night when the sun goes down this is a huge problem for grid operators because they run baseline power plants to cover the average usage these could be natural gas nuclear or even coal the baseline is designed to be as close to the minimum energy demand as possible then during times of the day when the energy demand rises above that baseline grid operators turn on peaker power plants to provide the difference the problem is peaker plants are smaller more expensive and normally dirtier forms of energy such as natural gas for their ability to be turned on and off quickly in response to grid need this is why many regions have moved to time of use billing where consumers are charged more money in the evening when everyone is getting home and starting to use more electricity the beauty of evs is that you can charge them overnight when the demand for electricity is at its lowest in fact here in san diego we have a special ev price plan that drops energy prices to just 13 cents per kilowatt hour from midnight to 6 a.m the problem then isn't raw electricity demand its unpredictability and huge spikes in a bygone era before netflix or on-demand streaming when bricks famously rushed to their kitchens to turn on their electric kettles for a spot of evening tea after their favorite television programs at nearly the same time a major challenge for grid operators it's a massive change in demand for a small period of time and it's something grid operators have to forecast and handle in real time so if evs are all smart and can be programmed to charge at strategic times it's very possible the end result to the grid is a flat rising baseline and this might not be as bad as you think when internal combustion engines first came on the scene 100 years ago people had the same concerns that they'd never work because people would never have wide access to gasoline just stick with your horse trust me this motor car fad too will pass but in a free market challenges and issues aren't problems they're opportunities fun fact early gas stations were local pharmacies and drugstores if there is a general increase in electrical demand it will be financially advantageous to open new power plants better yet if we ramp up renewable energy production wind and solar we could use these very same evs as battery storage to even further levelize the grid remember your utility is a middleman they don't produce electricity they buy it from power plants and sell it to you they don't much care where they buy this electricity from and with new innovative ideas tesla's auto bidder that allows power wall owners to buy and sell electricity almost a stock market if you have a solar system and an ev you can make money even when your car is parked this is called a virtual power plant and in the future with a more decentralized grid the energy used in your home might be coming from gary down the road and not from a power plant the average gas car is totally useless sitting around on your driveway but an ev is essentially a mobile power plant on wheels and with companies embracing vehicle-to-grid technology ford with its f-150 lightning you could buy electricity during times of lower demand when it's cheap and sell it back to the grid when it's expensive in fact we saw an amazing example of how helpful evs can be by serving as big battery packs during the recent floods in kentucky according to a report by electric just two f-150 lightnings alone help provide mobile power for workers to assist with getting 10 to 15 families back in their homes each and every day and even if you don't have a driveway or home charging you could benefit from cleaner forms of energy as you charge at public chargers since that energy could in the future come from people with solar panels or evs using these virtual power plant programs talk about a win win future virtual power plant programs try saying that three times fast could allow users to specify how much energy they're willing to trade even with just 10 kilowatt hours out of a 75 kilowatt battery pack 100 million evs could provide one billion killed hours of energy storage every day that's the equivalent of 7 752 of tesla's mega pack installations the hornsdale power reserve in south australia a level of grid storage we've never seen before and that's just 10 kilowatt hours still leaving drivers with plenty of charge for their daily needs technologies vehicle to grid for smart electric school buses also offer huge potential that could reduce how much more we need from the grid we can take an asset that transports kids for two hours a day and then just sits there for the other 22 and instead make them massive energy storage solutions and how about this a tesla supercharger station covered in solar panels in kettleman city california featuring about 750 panels if each panel was 350 watts that's a little over 263 kilowatts of power that's enough to charge three evs at 87 kilowatts with zero grid stream in short is our grid here in the us a bit long in the tooth yes it is but the future is electric it's why utilities love evs they know it'll mean profits will shift from oil companies to electricity companies and any good business will invest in their infrastructure if it means reaching larger profits also it's important to note just how much in subsidies oil companies received over the last century to get to where they are today and future infrastructure and spending i believe will move away from oil and gas and towards a truly electric future for every person that says the grid can't cope there was a horse breeder that said gas cars wouldn't work it's the nature of change imagine trying to pitch an idea for a social media app to investors 30 years ago things change and we're gonna have to stop looking at the future through the lens of the past let's continue this conversation in the comment section below don't forget to that button and and if you have been thank you so much for watching,1
Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfHtiJwiepCu_qwONFRaS06p,fpjcbTGaYgs,[music] hey what's up ricky with fully charged we have a very special episode for you today this is the canoe ldv now if you're thinking haven't we covered canoe before you're correct back in 2019 chelsea sexton actually did an episode on canoe but so much has changed in the past three years the pandemic you've probably heard of it and so much else the supply chains and everything else and for canoe particularly things have changed they've gone public they've changed their business models and some other challenges they've faced but i think they found some footing with some commercial customers so they now have contracts with the us army nasa and particularly with walmart who has a purchase order for 4 500 of these for their last mile delivery services so today we have just enough time here in dallas texas for a first impressions a quick drive and a ride-along and we're going to go through all that and more so this then is the canoe ldv and this is public fully charged live is coming to california this september the 10th and 11th powered by electrify america get your tickets to the number one ev and home energy show now [music] [music] me [music] why does the canoe matter you might be thinking a delivery vehicle well first of all there's also a personal version of this that has a seven seat option so for a car that's actually four inches shorter than toyota prius with all this interior room and an optional third row and this package is pretty rare also you've got to remember we at fully charged are all about reducing our carbon emissions and right now delivery is a big part of that equation now because 90 of americans live within 10 miles of a walmart location you can imagine the impact a car this could have for that business model sure amazon is the king right now with their warehouses but with over 4 000 stores and over 3 800 of them becoming online shipping centers this could be the car that catapults walmart and their current brick and mortar business into the online king of retail now the really magical part about this thing is the packaging okay now in comparison to this we have a bmw 4 series grand coupe we've lined them up in the front okay right in front which car do you think is longer come with me the canoe finishes right here the bmw is over a foot longer than the canoe and yet on the inside it has 120 cubic feet of cargo space thank you so much that's incredible [music] so let's talk about the interior of this thing because it is one of the most striking things i've ever seen starting with this greenhouse out in front of you i can see the road i can see a nickel two feet from the front of this car which is absolutely amazing there's no screen off in front of you you've got this screen right here and you've got your driving information on that screen to tell you how fast you're going what what gear you're in and all of that so as a result the view is unrivaled and for people who are doing delivery this has got to be leagues better than anything gasoline where all this area would just be engine and you wouldn't be able to see any of it through so as a result now the dashboard is very unconventional and kind of floating which is a bizarre design aesthetic that i just love here are your controls they're all kind of capacitive touch ac controls heated steering wheel i just checked that out that does work it's very impressive here on the steering wheel we have just two controls two rocker switches and these adjust the passenger and driver mirrors on a delivery truck that's what matters not music controls or anything else no it's the mirror positioning the brake pedals are pretty conventional right you've got your brake and your accelerator pedal but what's not conventional is the fact that there's nothing keeping you from just putting your feet up so this is probably one of the more roomy and comfortable trucks i've seen one of canoes real design points is comfort ergonomics and design for the delivery personnel so their seats are really quite well bolstered and comfortable the layout in the leg room for the passenger even is just massive and i think if i had to be in here doing deliveries for walmart for six or eight hours i think i'd be pretty comfortable [music] so here is a look at the back this would be the cargo area for the ldv now this particular configuration is just their default what they provide but walmart for example is going to have custom gear and equipment back here that is proprietary and we couldn't film but you can imagine the opportunities and how much space there is back here this is pretty cavernous now this isn't a massive area right i mean i could sit here and touch the edges almost but this is their smaller variant they do have an mpdv a multi-purpose delivery vehicle which is kind of a step up more the amazon rivian truck but for this size i you could not get more stuff in here in a smaller footprint and that's really what this is going to be good at this is going to be such an easy car to drive around town so if you're doing uber delivery or grocery or anything else finding a parking spot can be tough in those big vans but with this you can pretty much park anywhere a normal car would again four inches shorter than a toyota prius and it has a really really good turning radius so it's just gonna be easy to maneuver and just i think a delight for most people doing delivery [music] [music] this car we drove around making one delivery and we got attention wherever we went people came over to us and talked to us it just has that kind of iconic look [music] so now for the driving impressions i'm joined by gary who's going to chaperon me make sure i don't get into too much trouble you bet i'll take care of you i appreciate that if you're used to any kind of gas delivery ban there's a couple things about this that are going to be completely different first of all one pedal driving right you don't have to use your brakes at all you can speed up and slow down with just one pedal which is great the fly-by-wire steering the steering by wire system which means let me show you how easy this is to maneuver around town i want to make a u-turn i want to show you just how tight the turning radius is okay here we go turn the wheel that's it that's it not even one complete turn and i am making a u-turn and the tightest turn circle i've ever seen this is the rear-wheel drive single motor variant there will be eventually a dual motor all-wheel drive variant as well i'm curious to see how the turning circle is affected by the motors up front i'm sure i'm curious about that but this is probably the car that most would get i think the rear wheel drive for transit is probably the most popular spec for that vehicle so i'd imagine unless you live somewhere where there's a lot of snow and other conditions that's probably going to be the model that most people get so some other quick facts about this thing around an 80 kilowatt battery pack and they have 2170 cylindrical cells and it's good for about 200 to 250 miles of range now they say 200 plus and the reason is because it's a delivery van right you might load it up or not so depending on how you use it it'll probably affect how much range you get but that level of range is i think exactly what you need the ford transit ev does about 120 miles per charge which means could you make an entire day of walmart deliveries i'm not sure but with this i think you probably could just you come home at the end of the day and plug in and knowing that 90 of americans live 10 miles or closer to a walmart i can imagine this being a booming part of their business in the future so you've got your controls off to the left but the view from the driver's seat is cavernous and expansive it's really special the key takeaways low center of gravity good reliability and efficiency electric right combined with this view and also the fly-by-wire steering system and the incredible ratio on that lock to lock u-turn which is incredible you want to do u-turns all day don't you i do i'm gonna do one more yeah here's one more so we're not doing slaloms and you know acceleration tests but this is a delivery van which means the walmart employees are going to be using it as such and a fun fact i just heard from the walmart executive team is that the people doing the delivery are just their normal employees they don't have truck drivers or special personnel if you're an associate of walmart you might be on the part of the team that does the deliveries for their online services so in that case you probably don't have thousands of hours of big rig experience and you're going to really appreciate driving a car that feels a normal car i got to imagine that this is going to be their favorite car and i spent a little bit of time with dj during that delivery and his immediate feedback was this was his favorite of all the vehicles he's used for online delivery [music] what do we think about the canoe ldv all the reasons why you wanted to watch this episode when you saw the thumbnail they're all still here and pretty dang amazing the view from the front is nothing you've ever seen you have to witness it to see it and believe it but the challenges are still around and they do need to prove that they can reach scale and produce these vehicles now there is some good news on that front because they have partnered with a third-party manufacturing company to start producing the walmart 4500 order which is a great idea i've always said why not just outsource manufacturing especially early on other companies not just have to do all the r b to design a car and now you have to build a factory and learn how to manufacture it is a tall order for any one company so i think with their plan to outsource manufacturing get these out on the road take feedback from walmart make them better and finally get to customers they might be on the winning track so that is a really quick and rainy look at the canoe ldv admittedly very rushed but hopefully you guys got an idea of what this thing is all about don't forget to hit the button and and if you have been thank you so much for watching [music],0
Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfHtiJwiepCu_qwONFRaS06p,oeh_bURqRPs,jack and robert are always going on about how big cars are getting we're ditching sedans and hatchbacks and building more crossovers and suvs and i get it i do and that's why good news this week we're talking about this charming little single seat ev that you might have heard of called the tesla semi yeah it's the biggest eevee ever made and it makes the hummer ev look a toy for kids and tesla seems to think it's a really vital strategy going forward but is it should tessa just stick to building cars does this even make any sense let's find out i'm ricky and this is the fully charged show the footy child show then you will love our six live shows being held around the world in 2023 starting with sydney australia on march the 11th and 12th [music] whether you call them semis or 18 wheelers big rigs or lorries there's no denying how important they are here in the united states here's some really fun facts by the way there are about four million semi trucks in the u.s they drive a total of around 400 billion miles every year and they burn about 44.8 billion gallons of largely diesel and gasoline every single year starting to see why this could be kind of important to electrify also there are about three and a half million truck drivers employed here in the u.s and semis move around 72 percent of the us's entire freight industry by way all in they produce around 875 billion dollars in gross freight revenue but tesla can't make model 3s and y's fast enough so does this move make sense should they focus their production effort on passenger cars or the semi well based on a tweet from elon musk he claims that the semi can do about 1.7 kilowatt hours per mile and with a state range of around 500 miles we're talking about 850 code hours in battery storage plus around 50 probably for reserve so we'll call it a 900 kilowatt hour battery pack now this is not confirmed this is just kind of a rough back of the napkin calculation now that's enough to make 11 model wise with 81 kilowatt hour battery packs so building 11 model wise would offset 148 000 246 gasoline miles per year meaning we can get 11 gas cars off the road while the average semi truck drives between 100 to 150 000 miles a year but let's assume a hundred thousand to be conservative now technically that would be less miles offset than by our 11 model wise but factoring in 7 miles per gallon for a diesel semi things change quite a bit the semi will replace 14 286 gallons of diesel fuel per year the 11 model y is replacing 24 mile per gallon crossovers would replace 6177 gallons of gasoline so if tesla with 900 killed hours of battery capacity built one semi instead of the 11 model wise they would prevent burning 8109 gallons more of gasoline and now the business case for the semi is starting to make sense and this is why elon mentioned semis were only about one percent of the vehicles on the road but about 20 percent of emissions and 36 percent of all particulate emissions so that's the environmental reason now let's talk about the actual experience for a driver any truck driver out there is going to love the tesla semi or any electric semi no more 10 to 18 speed gearboxes that you're clunking around constantly single speed no transmissions we think of diesel engines as these massive powerhouses but really they're actually not and they only have a operational rpm around 2500 rpm so they need a lot of gearing to be able to get going and lift and carry that 80 000 pounds of cargo in comparison the tesla semi will have a tri-motor setup similar to the tesla model s plaid they'll have carbon wrapped sleeve motors just the plaid two of these drive units are actually only intended for acceleration or when you really need extra power and they can mechanically disconnect once you get to speed that means that the semi can maintain 55 60 miles an hour on the freeway with just that one electric motor in a lot of ways they've taken everything that they've learned over the past decade build cars and put it into the semi to make it as efficient as possible the end result is that the tesla semi will be the most capable big rig out on the road it'll have instant torque no gear shifts and plenty of power for going uphill but most importantly regenerative braking for going back downhill this is one of the scariest parts for a truck driver and if you've ever seen a runaway truck ramp down a hill that's why because oftentimes they have to engine brake and there's a limit to how much they can do that the friction breaks on a semi will just heat up and fail almost instantly but the tesla semi doesn't have any of these problems not only does it not need those brakes or any engine braking it can recharge the battery pack and regain some of that energy lost by going uphill on its way back down and finally they should prove to be way more reliable and require way less maintenance than diesel trucks and you gotta remember for a truck driver availability and uptime is critical anytime that truck is not up and running is money that that driver is losing something about the semi industry you might not know is that between 10 and 25 five percent of all semis or owner operators that means that yes we have walmart and amazon who buy and deliver their own trucks and hire employees to drive them but a large percentage of these trucks were owned by little mom and pop shops that have to maintain all their own maintenance and keep the trucks up and running and this is one of the questions that i have is yes the fleet buyers are going to buy these things by the droves because it'll make financial sense we'll get to why here in a second but what about the small mom and pop owner operators how are they going to receive the semi well i think to answer that we got to break this down by cost tesla hasn't released official prices for the semi and you know it was around 180 000 for the beer configuration back in 2017 but a lot has happened since then runaway inflation and a pandemic and everything else so odds are the test semi is going to probably cost between 200 and 250 000 let's go with 250 again to be conservative the average diesel semi is actually closer to a hundred thousand dollars so that is a substantial increase in upfront cost but how much money could you save by going electric well factoring five dollars per gallon for diesel the average here in the us and 20 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity here's the cost breakdown 71 428 dollars per year in diesel at a hundred thousand miles per year and 33 898 dollars per year in electricity for a hundred thousand miles now semi starts off a hundred and fifty thousand dollars more expensive on day one but drive a hundred thousand miles a year and it breaks even in just four years and after that the savings are just pure profit and again this doesn't account for maintenance which i think is going to be drastically cheaper too but that's harder to quantify but just from the fueling savings pretty impressive so i think for big fleet buyers there's gonna be a no-brainer and tesla is going to sell every semi that they make but there is one question that has popped up on a lot of news articles and youtube videos that i've seen which is all that extra battery weight is going to eat into the cargo capacity and every pound that you don't have to carry cargo is again money that you're losing so how much of a weight reduction penalty will the tesla smi have well projecting that it'll be a 900 kiloh battery pack and projecting out from tesla's current pack volume density numbers it'll be around 11 000 pounds just in batteries but diesels aren't exactly light either the paccar mx13 just has 500 horsepower and 1850 pound foot of torque it's a modern diesel engine that weighs around 2 600 pounds factor another 800 pounds for the transmission and 600 pounds to carry enough gasoline for 500 miles of range and we're at about 4 000 pounds for the tesla semi factoring about a thousand pounds for the motors and other equipment it'll come in at around 12 000 pounds compared to the traditional diesels four thousand but as elon mentioned in that live stream electric semis are allowed to be 2 000 pounds heavier so diesel semi can be 80 000 pounds an electric semi can be 82 000 pounds so the loss in holland capacity goes from 8 000 pounds to about six thousand now that is not nothing that is a significant amount of money and depending on what you're carrying that is potentially lost revenue hauling around dead weight in batteries and that's something that every operator is gonna have to figure out but there's so much to about the tesla semi when i did my for fully charged on the canoe we were at a walmart location and behind me we had to move locations three different times because there were semis that were idling now when these guys pull in for a rest stop they leave the engines running sometimes because they have refrigerated cargo that has to run or i don't know why they just leave them running and the smell and the fumes from those idling emissions is just horrible all that would be gone even if you have a refrigerated cab the tesla battery pack or any ev battery pack could keep that running without any concerns right so the value to the operator is massive and you gotta remember all that idling is breaking down the engine without putting on miles so the more you idle the more time you spend in rough stop and go city traffic that's all wear and tear on a diesel engine that is not being counted for with the miles driven so the real emissions reductions are probably going to be even bigger now before i let you guys go there's two things that were not mentioned in the live stream that i was wondering about the first self-driving in 2017 they made a big deal about driving in a convoy and full self-driving and how much less fatigue the drivers would have but they've stripped any mention of self-driving entirely from the second presentation i think the reason why is they want truck drivers to be excited and they don't want to sell a future where they're going to replace all of them with self-driving semis right so i think that kind of makes sense but i do think that they have all the cameras that they need including new cameras on the front of the rig to make this thing a delight to drive and i do think that that in the coming years they will have tons of self-driving features the second feature that was kind of left out is the bulletproof windshield which again goes back to the idea of uptime two very common scenarios that keep a semi from being operable is tires right they're constantly going through tires having to re-tread them and all the tire related maintenance and everything else and the second is a windshield they're massive windshields they're very vertical and they're just prone to chips and things and if you have a chipped windshield you cannot drive a semi and if it takes a couple of days to get a replacement that is time and money that you're losing so that bulletproof windshield concept that tesla first showed off would have huge implications in this industry as well and i'm hoping the semi does come with both of them so let's kind of wrap this up right the tesla semi is not exactly what jack and robert and us here at fully charged think of when we think of little tiny motoring but you have to understand just how massive this industry is and you got to also think a lot of people have said that larger rigs this are not capable of being electrified that we need hydrogen but tesla showed you 500 miles of true range from the bay area to san diego which i've done that drive i know how how it goes they've made it with the semi which is pretty impressive at full weight at 82 000 pounds so i got to tell you i'm pretty excited and tesla's not the only ones in this space by the way mercedes and volvo and other companies are working on the same concepts even nicola we'll see what they do in a future perhaps but electrification is going to spread to every part of our lives and this is a massive one that we cannot ignore so maybe in the future we'll do a follow-up and test drive one of these if that becomes available but don't forget to and if you have questions or comments leave them down below and if you have been thank you so much for watching,2
Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfHtiJwiepCu_qwONFRaS06p,yrpq8YFvZWs,[music] this is the electromechanica solo and here's the premise three wheels two doors and one seat and with a starting price of fifteen thousand dollars before any incentives or anything else and 100 miles of pure electric range they believe this is the answer to commuting in america do we have a point well people actually want to buy one of these and what is it to drive let's find out i'm so excited i'm ricky this is full charge show the fully charred show then you will love our live shows being held around the world in 2023 next we're back in the uk for two yes two uk shows first we're at farnborough in april then we're heading to our first ever event in the north in harrogate in may now let's talk about the exterior styling of this thing which is by far the most crazy and bold statement that this car makes out in front we have are traditional headlights you'd expect this is the grille for cooling the battery and motors and other systems but this really is the star of the show this cyclops headlight is a requirement because of this classification of vehicle being more of a motorcycle it needs this third headlight the reason is these two headlights on the front are so close to each other it doesn't give forward-looking drivers enough of a clue of what you are so this third headlight mounted up high is a law that this car had to have now other cars that have three wheels the aptera don't have this requirement the reason why is the abterra is really wide the front of the aptera is pretty much a full-size car this is really small in comparison we have some pretty dramatic fender flares for the wheels up front a single windshield wiper this is all you need for this little front windshield which is again just kind of crazy we'll get into the driving of this in a minute here and going along the sides we have huge huge mirrors i don't know why these side mirrors are so big now you have a door on either side and this is probably one of the quirkiest parts about this car i would have probably gone with just one door and save money and that's pretty much it for the glass in this car you have your passenger and driver side your front and that's it there's no panoramic moon roof for anything else moving on the side you have a really nice aerodynamic profile that contours and comes to a really small point this is one of the keys to this car's efficiency of 5.7 miles per kilowatt hour all right driving around town is quite a delight it doesn't really feel that different than any other car lower speeds there's less road noise it just feels more normal and if anything it's actually kind of a dream because of the really tight turning radius and smaller space as far as parking and parking lots and stuff way easier than the average american car now it is the moment of truth electromechanical says this thing can do 80 miles an hour with a 50 horsepower motor and 17.4 kilowatt hours of battery storage let's find out 93 on the battery zero miles on the trip meter here we go 40 45 miles an hour 50. all right i am flooring it now 65. 70 75 80 82 all right there's a limiter at 82. so the top speed electric mechanica is 82 and now you're hearing it i feel i'm yelling it's a little bit loud in here the wind noise is not bad actually with the normal pillared windows but the road noise is is really loud keep it up with traffic on ramps merging i don't think this would pose any kind of problem i'd be comfortable doing it at any time [music] all right so first day first impressions we've consumed 32 percent of the battery and driven 23 miles ideally you'd want to see one mile per percent about 100 miles in total but we're not based on our current numbers we'd be getting 72 miles per charge but today we're kind of sporadic a lot of freeway we'll do more driving we'll keep looking at it throughout the course of the next couple days but let's talk about charging one of the really interesting things about this car is because it has such a tiny battery it doesn't need all that much in the way of charging so even with a level one charger this and a 110 outlet here in the us you could charge this thing to full in just 12 hours which means you can charge it about halfway between the time from midnight to 6 a.m when you when you wake up and it also has this 240 volt which would allow you to charge this thing up in about two and a half or three hours but we don't have that so we would take that off and just plug it into the wall [music] i hear the fans running so we're we're charging at seven amps and it says time remaining was about nine hours so this is probably the last of driving for today by tomorrow it'll be fully charged and that's what you can expect as well if you got one of these you could charge it at home on a 110 every day no need for electricians no need for level two charging you could just do that all on any traditional plug [music] now the difference between today and yesterday is now that it's warm out here in san diego in the day even in january we didn't need the heaters and that's going to be one of the factors that will determine your range are you running a resistive heater or your seat heaters yesterday i was running both that's where i came up with the 70 miles of range not 100 but today at 80 miles an hour i would have gotten about 85 miles of range on the freeway that's pretty amazing so as you can see behind me with this ultra wide lens it looks i'm gonna fight her playing cockpit and that is totally the vibe you get driving this thing that'll either make you feel one of two ways depending on who you are you'll either feel a bit claustrophobic because again i can i can reach out and touch both ends of the glass here or you're a freaking fighter pilot i'm digging that i gotta tell you two days in driving this thing it has grown on me a lot now the one question i know you're thinking is how safe is it it doesn't have the same classifications or crash test ratings and reviews as a traditional car but from what electromechanicals told me it has front and rear crumple zones they also have triple reinforced steel side impact protection on both doors and i believe it because these doors are pretty thick and it has a good clunk when you close them and of course it has traction controls stability control and three wheel power disc brakes [music] now one thing about this car that i wish was improved as well is the regen braking it's almost non-existent it's not nearly as much as it needs to be to be anywhere near one pedal driving let alone you know regenerating downhill or something so you're not going to get that range back which is a shame because that's really where evs shine and stop and go traffic anytime you slow down you get a lot of that battery power back 80 percent of it my biggest gripe i think with this car is that the fan speed at low the lowest setting for the fan is just way too loud i wish they could dial that down so that the lowest fan speeds are just barely audible just move some air around keep circulating but i don't want to hear it so loudly it's the loudest thing in this car because most of my other gripes for example the padding for the armrest that's just a quick little ten dollar fix but i don't know about that fan motor oh this is one of the most economy fueling cabins i've ever been in everything is hard touch plastic every dorsal every door even where your elbows rest is hard plastic the steering wheel there's no fake stitching or anything else hard plastic here's something that you probably haven't seen depending on how old you are a single din stereo well's last time you saw a car with a standard single din stereo yeah look at that a key just a key it doesn't require a neural link implant there's no cards or anything else old-fashioned key but other than that this car is as little as you need to drive around and oh let's not forget us americans we gotta have our cup holder overall sitting in this car for any period of time i felt it was quite comfortable the seats are really good the one thing i wish i would change is that the seat belt latch is right where your left buttocks comes down that's something that depending on how large of derriere you are it might be a little bit of a nuisance thank you [music] it's a little getting used to really does and this got me a lot of attention out on the road but you've got circular tail lights here that are your brake lights turn signals and the reverse light is all built in the charge doors back here traditional j1772 plug with a level one charge you can fill this thing up in about nine and a half hours go to level two and you can charge it up in about two and a half hours but no rapid charging no dc fast charging here and of course talking about the solo would not be complete without talking about this your single drive wheel this is your one wheel in the back the front wheels are just for steering all your power comes out here and if you look on this side this protective element here protects the belt so the motor is a little bit more centrally mounted and it has a belt drive to this wheel back here you might be thinking what about rear cargo area well there actually is a space back here on this the traditional standard model there's five cubic feet worth it's actually not bad if you look it has quite a bit of room for groceries or other various odds and ends so why is this significant why does it matter and why make an episode about it well the average american drives 41 miles per day to and from work well in the range of this car also 76 percent of americans drive to work alone normally in big suvs to get 15 miles a gallon and that's the case for this car if you drive to and from work and you can save money might buy something as cheap as this actually make more sense i've had this car for the past two days and that's pretty rare we don't normally get to keep cars that long and with every time i got into the car i just started loving it a little bit more and more and more and if you look around the car inside and outside every decision the engineering team made seems to be for the purpose of how do we build a fifteen thousand dollar car this car was made in china but they are moving that operation on shore to mesa arizona where they've procured a 200 000 square foot facility where they're going to make 20 000 of these a year and with the simple design having a lot less stuff per car i think they just might do it if you have any questions or comments write to us let us know below don't forget to and if you have been thank you so much for watching foreign,2
Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfHtiJwiepCu_qwONFRaS06p,SVxc3JLjIhg,2022 was an absolutely amazing year for ev sales here in the u.s they've quickly gone from the quirky curiosity of early adopters to ready for mass market adoption and we're talking about car sales here in the us for evs tesla is king with over 65 percent market share so what exactly makes the tesla model y so good and what's it actually to drive and to own and can you actually fit in the third row this is the tesla model y and this is the fully charged show we know you love the fully charged shot so why not come to one of our global live shows in 2023 and 2024 the next shows are in the uk specifically von bra and harrogate get your tickets today all right straight talk full size adults aren't really going to fit back here my head touches the glass and as you can tell here even with the seat moved all the way forward i just don't have enough room but that's not really the point of this car if you have a family of seven and you need a seven passenger suv this is not the car for you you're probably still going to be better off with a river and r1s or a bigger full-size suv but if you have children and you just need to have the occasional access to the rear seats when family comes into town well then that's exactly what this car is made for children will fit back there very comfortably there's room for car seats and everything else and we'll get back to that here more in a little bit out front you have a very familiar front end the same headlight design as the model 3 and the same arrow that you've come to know and love you've got cut out to bring the air up and over the wheels making this a pretty felt car with a really good drag coefficient really the looks are probably not the reason why you're buying this car the design is fine it's good it doesn't really shatter any barriers or break any design patterns or winning awards but overall a good looking eevee but that's really not the full story to really understand why this car sells as well as it does we got to get in and take it for a drive [music] when it comes to software this is where i think the tesla is by far the car you want the model y in particular because their software is so good the responsiveness of the maps and all the menus are top notch so now let's talk about the driving dynamics now this car is a little more plush a little more compliant than the model 3. the model 3 is definitely pretty stiff and on the sportier side now the model y is still sporty i think this is a sportier ride there's less body rolls a little bit stiffer than competitors the iv4 also you have controls for how much feedback and how much assist you want in the steering and it really makes a huge difference i'm a sports enthusiast i sports sedans so i have it on the sport mode and the steering wheel is really responsive there's a healthy level of feedback and jitter from the road of course it is a electronically assisted systems you're not going to get a ton of back but there's no play very tight and the steering feel is fantastic it's very confidence inspiring being electric i'm going 58 miles an hour full throttle i'm going 80 miles an hour this car is wildly faster than any model of any other midsize crossover suv on the market the next thing let's talk about the cargo capacity and if the sloping roof design really is much of a problem with me i have got a whole accoutrement of various things that i've been packing and unpacking recently i have a carry-on travel bag kind of a medium-sized bag a full-size airline bag and a bunch of car seats and strollers and stuff and i want to show you just how capable this actually is and to help me demonstrate i have my son remy say hi let's start with the frunk now this is a carry-on bag for an airline opening the frunk by the way an app or on screen there's no button up here a little odd but not a big deal you can't open that from anywhere in the world which is kind of cool but now this frunk is a little bit smaller because this has the biodefense hazard system the really complicated hvac but because it's the y and it's a little bit taller i can fit one of these bags in here just fine i'll put it this way there's still a little bit of room for backpacks and stuff this might look the floor but it's actually not because there's no gas tank or spare tire which is good or bad depending on how you look at it there's a massive cavernous area down here and this actually kind of lifts up which it's actually big enough for the larger but not the biggest size of airline luggage now the tires the wheels on this thing are kind of hitting so it doesn't close but i mean most of that is down there and if we remove this and just put it on the inside you've got a fair bit of room for other stuff the big airline luggage and maybe a stroller right remy what do you got there and here we go so it's a little bit of a tight fit but that is all three airline luggage a stroller and a remington [music] [applause] [music] being in the model y as opposed to a model 3 you have just a cavernous amount of headroom jack would appreciate this being six foot five but the glass combined with the higher roof line just makes for a really expensive feeling cockpit and that glass wraps all the way around the front has really got good visibility now one drawback of the car is the rear visibility is not great that rear glass is tiny it's raked at a very high angle and so looking through the back is a little challenging to be honest but of course you can always just pull up the cameras and again the new software update you can see both sides and the rear at the same time and the integration with their mobile app and everything else again is just world class this car has keyless entry with a card or your phone and it just works and it works flawlessly all the time if you want to give your friends access you can send them a code they can download the app and they can drive your car you can make it expire when you're done with it you can have the profile linked to your phone so my wife drives my car we i drive my car juan drives this car but whose ever phone is used to unlock the car it knows who that person is moves the seats moves the cameras moves the mirrors sets the car up for that user and even remembers things your hvac system where your heating and cooling settings were and recalls all of it it's just a delight and it's one of those things you don't notice you'll never think about it when you drive this car until you drive a car that doesn't have those features all right now let's do a little fit check remy you good here we go okay his little legs got room yes okay how about me okay i am six feet tall i've got three inches over my head and i actually have a couple inches in front of me as well let's sit in front of myself and um jack could fit in either of those rows honestly so this is yeah in terms of spacing and stuff as long as the person in the very back is remington sized individual i think you're gonna be fine if i was gonna tell my mom and dad to get an ev the reason why i've always leaned towards tesla is it just makes everything easy you don't have to be a 1920s aviator with a map out trying to figure out the best route where to go you don't have to call ahead or check different apps to see which chargers are available or which ones aren't you get a tesla all of that stuff just works just as i was talking about how great their software is i don't know if you can see this but the windshield wipers keep coming on with the lane keep it is a clear balloon sky day and my windshield wipers are on this is one of those quirky things i think i might have to just pull over and do a software restart what is going on i've never seen this before i'm gonna pull over and see if i can restart the computer and see if that goes away has it ever happened to you no right damn see the screen just turned black restarting the can computer which is not the drive computer that's a different computer it's as easy as just pushing these two buttons down now in my model 3 i've probably done a restart every year so maybe three or four restarts over three or four years and in this car this is the first time i've had to do it let's see if that takes care of my auto steer problem one thing to note is if anything goes wrong with your screen you can't see anything you don't know how fast you're going you don't have directions you don't have anything here you shoot in the dark okay computers back online from the restart let's see if that weird windshield wiper bug is gone look at that okay i have never seen that one before it's not that big of a deal but it is odd i couldn't tell you why that was happening but it's fine now now look i understand this is kind of a head over heart situation this car is not gorgeous there are better looking bbs out there they're more exciting more new or cool but tesla's and the tesla model one in particular is just quietly brilliant it doesn't jump off the page there's a bajillion of them just look around but it does everything so well and i think a couple of years from now it'll age well they're battery packs and their battery management systems are top of the line they're charging infrastructure will keep up and keep pace and their software will continue to delight you with future updates and cool new features you haven't even dreamed of yet that is a look at the tesla model y thank you so much for watching if you have comments or questions sound off in the comments below and if you have been thank you so much for watching,-1
Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfHtiJwiepCu_qwONFRaS06p,lDZfsUh1uRw,after a 20-year absence here in north america the vw bus is back but this isn't just any buzz this is the long wheelbase edition an extra 10 inches all of which benefits that room in the back now we have just the shortest amount of time today to give you a first look at the long wheelbase id buzz and why i think this might be the most amazing road trip ev money can buy [music] the 40 show is generating positive energy with its live events all around the world next up it's fully charged live canada the top right of the screen to get your tickets today the original vw bus was one of the most iconic cars in america it symbolized the counter culture of the 60s and 70s so building a spiritual successor it's no easy feat so how do they do well first of all i love that you can clearly tell this is special there's nothing on the road it but at the same time they didn't feel beholden to have to make it look just the original [music] meanwhile outside we were lucky enough to be reacquainted with a legend there's just something magical about this design it kind of takes you back in time and this is a pretty immaculate example of one but there's that two-tone right there's the massive logo i actually didn't realize how massive that is and there's just enough here to make you think yeah that's a vw bus but without being beholden to any one thing i love that that is a perfect balance in combination of legacy and heritage but also being new and its own thing great design one of the most iconic things about this car is it looks so cute from afar and from all the press materials and videos that i've seen i thought this was a small little car but it's absolutely massive look at this for perspective it's taller than me this is actually bigger than the volkswagen atlas a very popular seven-seater suv here in the us it's taller and it's just a little bit longer being a van it means that the ride height is a lot lower than an suv so getting in and out is that much easier also the tall height means loading kids and out of car seats is that much easier to getting in is just that easy and look how much room we have what's really cool is the second and third row are on rails which means you have an adjustment of 20 centimeters back and forth in both rows this is all the way forward and i still have leg room and this is all the way back and this is i could almost sleep back here so not the most uncommon or unusual feature but you have power sliding doors on both sides which is a great touch but this one a little more unique this window actually pops out and slides out and we jump to some footage of the outside you can kind of see where that's located but that actually opened for some fresh air for the back seat passengers so if you have kids that get carsick on long trips that will be a literal breath of fresh air all right i don't know if you can see my feet but this is with the seat pushed forward and i'm pushed back this is a limousine experience in the back seat and this is a really nice touch especially on longer road trips with all this greenhouse it can get warm very quickly and that little bit of moving air can make all the difference for back seat passengers what a thing getting to the third row is as simple as pulling this handle back here everything pops forward it's really well counterbalanced really easy and because of that massive door look how easy this is to get into i haven't been in any suv electric or otherwise that has this much room maybe a chevy tahoe or a cadillac escalade but short of that this is absolutely amazing the iconic styling carries through all the way to the back this is a beautiful thing with the seats in the upward position this is how much cargo space you have with seven passengers you could put airline luggage pretty easily and fit all of it but if you need extra room just pulling this little lever drops the seats down foreign and you can just see how massive this is now you might be thinking that this would be where the floor is again an iconic van attribute that suvs don't have is the lower loading height but because i think the battery pack is right around there these seats don't fold into the floor they stay kind of upright so this really is the the ride height floor and if you look at how much room there would be with these gone you can just imagine how much stuff you could fit for a family of five for all of your adventures and all of that could be yours because you could put them back in or take them out as you want i love that so i have the third row on the rail slid all the way forward and the second row slid all the way back this car is so massive there's still a gap between the rows and that gives you an idea of just how much leg room you would have in both the second and third row can i sleep in here we go you ready i'm kind of falling in a little but oh this is a dream yes absolutely maybe you can put bunk beds in here and bring the kids along absolutely massive so with the longer wheelbase comes more battery options for example the standard has a 77 code hour usable battery pack and this long wheelbase goes up to 85. on the inside there's also a lot of really cool stuff for example eight usbc ports that power over delivery the pd standard between 45 watts can charge all your ipads and stuff and keep the kids happy there's a light bar that gives you notifications for example when a turn is coming up that's really cool and vw has mentioned that they have a new software that they've unveiled with the id7 as well and the buzz has it and it does appear in my quick preliminary testing to definitely be more responsive and a little more intuitive i think vw absolutely nailed this design when i first saw it i wanted one that was my immediate reaction and the reason it kind of reminds me of the canoe it is a master class and interior packaging because the vehicle is actually about the same size as vw atlas but because of the small overhangs front and back all that interior cabin space is maximally optimized [music] all right so for the size comparison behind me here this is the normal wheelbase buzz it's pretty staggering just how much bigger this is and all that happens right here between the wheelbase it's not always easy to reboot a legend but in this case i think vw absolutely nailed it huge emblem this is one of those iconic vw bust elements still remains now this is the north american version and the logo lights up so i think this for all the other car brands out there this is how you reboot something legendary from the past you have some of the original charm and character but you don't be beholden too much to design and you make something modern and great so that is a really quick first look at the id buzz long wheelbase here in north america an absolute legend now when you get a chance to drive it here today but jack has driven the normal wheelbase version which you should check out next thank you so much for watching,2
Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfHtiJwiepCu_qwONFRaS06p,7_j8ZiIwDA8,this is a mercedes c11 a concept car born in the 60s and 70s during the oil crisis this was not just a gorgeous thing with golden doors classic mercedes it's much more than that this was a test bed for all sorts of new innovative ways to be more efficient for example this car behind me has a drag coefficient of 0.19 and early versions came with a winkle rotary motor a tiny rotary engine and then later on a efficient diesel all cutting edge stuff for the time this car broke records about 200 miles an hour did i mention it's absolutely gorgeous but this isn't electric so why are we here in beautiful carlsbad california at the research and development center for mercedes to show you this this is the spiritual successor this is the vision 111 and this is electric cho is generating positive energy with its live events all around the world next up it's fully charged live canada the top right of the screen to get your tickets today [music] a wise man once told me tell me who you marry who your spouse is and i'll tell you a lot about you it kind of goes the same for car companies show me what companies a company acquires and you can tell a lot about what they want to do in the future in the case of mercedes they bought the company yeah so that we'll talk about here shortly that develops the axial flux motor featured in this car now long term the plan is to use these yasa axial flux motors for their amg line of really high performance electric cars and i don't know about you but axial flex motors amg electric yes all of those things and as many as you can make this is not going to be a cheap car of course it's mercedes these are iconic things but for a company of this magnitude to be developing technology this it just means that much more let's talk about the design of this car you can't talk about the c-111 i'm not talking about this the gullwing door made famous by mercedes of course with the 300 sl which i actually had a chance to see outside those golden doors were iconic and mercedes is always the company that comes to mind when i think golden doors and just in the original the new ones got them too and it's quite striking there's also a lot of other shared design language for example this front inlet that has kind of the same look as the original the blacked and orange two-tone color scheme and if you look at the overall dimensions of the car they haven't changed all that much from the original of course the biggest difference would be these tiny little wheels compared to the massive ones the new one has and all the fender bulges and everything else that they have had to craft in order to make room for them but overall the design of this car and speaking with the designers comes down to this simple idea of a very elegant and simple shape that just feels it's sitting on top of the engineering bits the part underneath all the arrow and the diffusers and everything else that's made for the track but it has this kind of combination of beauty and design and form on top and the function on the bottom they come together in a very interesting way the matrix pattern tears out through the back as well and you got these cute little red brake lights kind of the original used to have but of course you can have it read whatever you want when i first walked up it said one eleven sounds a fighter jet it's such a cool thing active arrow with this spoiler that can actually retract and come out and the diffusers and splitters and everything else are just fixed in place if you get down really low you can see the axial flex motors that would be powering this thing and that really is the most amazing part about this look in reality i thought that there was a plane flying that i should shut up and i think i might just do that so to understand the brilliance of the axial flux motor let's look at a traditional radial flux motor here's a kind of a cross section of how the windings are run now really quick without nerding out too much about this there's one basic fundamental concept you have to understand about electric motors and that is the relationship between electricity and magnetism to do that you can use the right hand rule left-handers sorry got to use your right hand for this but if you put your thumb out in the direction that the current is flowing then your fingers show you how the magnetic fields would be produced so here in this motor the windings run this way you can produce electricity neither this direction or that direction to join it this way by reversing the polarity magnetic field lines would form that way this way they form this way and by switching it back and forth and by being smart about which ones are on and which ones are off you can constantly force by attraction and repulsion the rotor to move and that's how this works by the way radial flux motor well well the magnetic field lines move radially now here in the axial flux motor things are a little bit different this is what the copper windings look and you can actually see it right in here and because of their orientation using our right hand rule you can see that the magnetic field lines come this way in the axis of the motor hence the name axial flux motor so yes this is a concept car mercedes isn't going to actually mass produce these but while most people look at the design and the look and the cool futuristic stuff concept cars really have another purpose and that is to be engineering test beds for all kinds of new things axial flux motors for example just the original was all right let's talk a little bit about the interior i actually love this steering wheel i think the yoke thing was kind of weird but i think a nice squared off wheel is pretty stunning look at the quality of some of these controls you've got buttons over here and this floating instrument cluster for all your controls you've got volume and everything else the drive control would be here but the coolest thing in here has got to be this dash now this kind of reminds me of the id light in the volkswagen cars that has a little car that provides context your right turn is coming up and the light would kind of move this takes that to another level imagine you can have arrows flying across the screen and giving you context of your next turn direction or if some other little notification happened or something else your speed be right in front the seating position is race car i would say you've got your controls here for the doors and the seat recline positions and that classic gull wig door honestly it is one of the most iconic parts of this car it's actually pretty roomy and spacious seating for two and it even has the cool luggage compartment with the strap downs the original did all those years ago this is a beautiful beautiful thing how much of this would actually ever be into production nose this takes everything that the original had and modernizes it starting with that golden door how would you open it there's not a handle in sight just clean lines all the way through well it's all power now baby just that simple i would feel i'd be a fighter pilot going to work every day driving one of these things that would be absolutely amazing and how about these windows it looks it just blends into the body of the car and it's the most amazing way what's interesting is on the inside you can actually see through it pretty well but it just gives you that illusion and unlike the original even though it has gull wings it actually has a glass on top giving you a nice airy green space feel while you're inside the cabin but overall i think the real thing about this car that makes it so beautiful and timeless is how much it reminds me of the original and it also has really smooth and clean contours it doesn't feel a razor blade most modern sports cars that'll cut you if you just touch them but this keeps all the simplicity and the elegance and the streamline looks and most importantly as we mentioned this is a test bed for future technology i'm not gonna lie i kind of thought i was over concept cars i just started to not really see the point of them but then i remembered there's a reason from an engineering perspective why these kinds of things matter this is where you start with new technology things axial flux motors and slowly over time this will come down market into more of the mainstream car buying audiences and this is where it all starts with concepts of crazy cool engineering this all right if you thought this was cool you gotta check out this next right,2
Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfHtiJwiepCu_qwONFRaS06p,KyrSdgtx-Wo,thank you [music] this is the electron one it's part bicycle part motorcycle all awesome there's some pretty interesting engineering that goes into this so i'm gonna try to ride this today and not kill myself and see if college me would be impressed i'm ricky visit electron one and this is a fully charged show the fully charged show is generating positive energy with its live events all around the world next up it's fully charged live canada the top right of the screen to get your tickets today so what happens on the electron is we have what's called the generator chain drive or gcd the rider pedals at the cranks their energy is sent down to a transfer hub via chain and that that transfer hub it is split it goes to the back wheel by a chain and to a separate onboard generator also via chain what this does it allows the rider to pedal continuously generating electricity and not have to shift through any bicycle gears to match their human output to the speed of the motor so as an engineer i always to see something new and figure out why why is it the way it is let's see if we can't figure out some of the design of the electron one first of all the most striking feature is that long wheelbase this is a really long vehicle and that's what lends itself to that recumbent or feet forward design language and that's really important because the bicycle is not particularly aerodynamic you can imagine how tall the rider is it's a huge frontal area that's just getting hit with wind and that's why most bicycles aren't particularly aerodynamic but this really is plus this polycarbonate cover really helps move the air around the rider as opposed to being colliding with especially as your knees are moving up and down and all the other stuff makes for a very dirty wake around the rider but thus cleans a lot of that up and it even has mirrors and actually works really well one of the interesting things about this is how you get in you get in in front of the controls still feels a little odd but the key really and it takes a little bit of time to get used to it is to accept that this is a feet forward or recumbent bike it's you've got to lean into it when i first got on i was riding this and i was trying to t-rex it it just it wasn't working out very well as soon as i kind of got my feet up and put my back more into the seat then the controls felt right about where they should be and the lean and the other dynamics and characteristics of the bike started to make more sense there's not that much weight on the front wheel so at low speeds you don't have as much turning authority that kind of picks up after about five kilometers an hour ten and you start to get to lean and everything else but with the good throttle controls it's not all that bad according to fabricio he says you need about 20 hours to really get comfortable on this thing which makes me feel a lot better because i've been on it for about one or two and i'm getting about 85 percent comfortable i'd say but there's still a little more to go let's take a look around back so this whole seat by the way carbon fiber and fabricio does all of this himself custom layups and all of that the seat really comfortable foam you can sit in this thing for quite a while the mesh back means you don't get a sweaty back you get pretty decent airflow coming through and it's a really nice seat now back here there's actually a tail box is what they call it all carbon fiber we'll get to why that is important in a second but you have room for quite a bit of stuff i think there's smaller non-bubble version has maybe 80 liters of capacity and the bigger one has 120 which is more than enough room for groceries and other stuff plus if you empty everything out you even have room for legs and a little seat for a small rider a child or something if you wanted to do that and there's even a little cable to be able to add an extra battery for even longer range this will do about 200 kilometers at 30 kilometers per hour but if you want to go 50 or 60 obviously you're going to get less range but you could add more batteries if you wanted to speaking of batteries this has about 3.8 kilowatt hours of batteries between the two packs that are mounted around here and they're mounted really low and this gets to probably the most important engineering design consideration for a bike this and that is weight distribution this bike weighs about 150 pounds but it's incredibly easy to manipulate it feels incredibly light anybody can move this i can move this with just a couple of fingers unlike a motorcycle the average motorcycle is about this tall and it weighs about 500 pounds 400 to 500 with the big gas engine and transmission fuel tank and everything else i used to joke that on my sport bikes that i used to ride my honda cbr600rr there's about a 5 or 10 degree lean angle that you can pull off without losing control after about 10 or 15 degrees the bike is just too heavy to control and that's because of that high center of gravity but unlike on a sport bike this has an incredibly low center of gravity the motors the batteries most of the frame is all below the rider more in line with the axis of the wheels that's really important all of this very lightweight this is carbon fiber this is all carbon fiber and the entire tail box is carbon fiber so everything that sets above the chassis here is really really lightweight and that's what gives it that really nice control you can easily tilt this and it makes for a very surprisingly pleasant riding experience [music] okay so being a recumbent bike does pose some challenges stopping and starting getting on and off right they're feet up this how does that work well there's a brilliant little foot rest right here you push it down push the whole bike over center and now got a nice little comfortable place to be while you're waiting for a red light or something else how about starting back up again equally simple because that mechanism isn't so long it can be overcome just with the power of the motor so light turns green and you're off so one of the things i think is the most surprising about this ride so far is how comfortable the suspension is honestly way more a motorcycle than it is a bicycle it has a lot of travel let's get around here a lot of travel just kind of soaks up the road feels pretty nice and planted doesn't hurt to have a nice cushioned seat as well god vancouver is gorgeous fully charged show vancouver september get your tickets links in the description what's really nice is a good riding tennis is maybe 80 rpm right i can just stick that and stay right around there and go as fast as i want for example [music] i'm not i'm not tied to the speed i can pedal at 80 rpm and go as fast as i want which is super super cool and by the way this has regenerative braking too so when i hit the brakes the early part of the brake pedal actually engages the regenerative braking system which is really nice because this weighs 150 pounds and unless you want to be changing brake pads all the time that's a really nice feature and adds range of course and we love that here so my first question before agreeing to hop on this bike was about the tires because i didn't really trust regular bicycle tires but good news this has more motorcycle tires and it's really nice and thick and it gives you that little extra in terms of confidence on the road [music] let's talk controls really simple you have two hands here on the right hand we have our throttle which is really nice and well dialed in the throttle mapping it makes it pretty nice you can dial in exactly what you need to get started up hills downhills get a little extra speed to pick up if you're kind of feel you're leaning over really nicely done you also have the rear brake here on the right hand now switching over the left hand we have the front brake right here control for the light switch right there and an indicator for turning your blinkers on now this is interesting because e-bikes don't actually require that but because this is kind of in the middle of a motorcycle and an e-bike and they kind of balance that pretty well it has it left right and of course a little horn [music] so from the writer's perspective you've got your rear view mirrors worked pretty well and this control right up here it shows your pack voltage how far you're driven 46 kilometers your current speed and it even has this indicator here for when the brakes are applied there's a little magnetic switch you can hear that trigger and it tells when the brakes are applied there's a lot of logic going on to make this as safe as possible for example if a brake is engaged this the throttle does nothing it won't actually give you anything so the one tricky thing is on hills and stuff you got to kind of find your balance and let go the brake and turn the throttle kind of to get that balance of of factors but by and large they've kind of thought through the design of everything and everything's very accessible and easy to reach all right i spent the last four hours with the electron one and i have had some really good fun two things i've learned one vancouver is absolutely gorgeous and two this does make a ton of sense for most city centers 200 kilometers of range with 3.8 kilowatt hours of battery pack that's just impressive there's a couple other fun facts too for example most of these components are commercial off the shelf and electron is really big on the right to repair so all this stuff is going to be very easy to maintain and keep up for you over the years of owning it support us stop burning stuff patreon and help us to tackle misinformation about electric vehicles and clean energy but there is a big elephant in the room which is going to be price now we'll put down below in the in the what this costs but the goal is to bring the prices down with simpler and better design and also more mass manufacturing that's ultimately what it comes down to it can't be affordable if you're making them buy the fives and that's what electron is currently doing but in the future as they dial down their manufacturing they're gonna be able to get these prices down and that is what i'm really hoping they're able to accomplish all right so that is a really quick first look at the electron one thank you so much for watching you thought that was cool you got to watch this next,2
Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfHtiJwiepCu_qwONFRaS06p,Y3Wa7aL3_Fg,"elon mus son famously asked him why the future doesn't look the future and elon's response was this the tesla cyber truck and now that i've seen this thing in its stainless steel flesh i kind of love it but there's so much more to this truck than meets the eye in fact there's some serious engineering in here that will be in all cars in the next 5 years or so and to prove it we're going to drive up to napa valley and see just how good this truck actually is this is a cyber truck and there is a fullly charge sh fully charged then you'll love our fun-packed everything electric expos around the world next up we're in london and harriet remember energy and transport professionals go free on the first day first impressions of the cyber truck driving it for a little bit first of all i'll say this might be tesla's most cohesive design language ever everything is polygons and hexagons everything is sharp edges and that aesthetic kind of carries over the entire car you know the cup holders are polygonal and so are the seats so are all the controls the steering wheel is neither circular or square it's a squirtle a square circle hybrid the controls are on the wheel but unlike the model s and x which are tactile buttons it's just a capacitive touch these are actual buttons which i much prefer to the model s and x those capacitive buttons for a driving machine i i don't know it never felt it was quite the right thing but um otherwise on the steering wheel we have your wiper which is probably worth checking out the size of that thing i don't know if you saw that on the screen but this car has the largest piece of automotive glass ever and it's absolutely massive almost goofy as i'm driving this thing it's apparent that it is a heavy car but at the same time it doesn't feel all that poor into drive the visibility is really nice cuz you can see right out the front now the rear visibility we should probably talk about it's non-existent fact they have the tiniest little rear viiew mirror here and i don't know why they have it because with the tunnel cover closed you can't really see anything and if you're wondering well most people will have the tunnel cover open i don't think so because that actually will eat into your range if you want the most range possible you want to have that closed that means there's no window out the back the good news is there's a nice wide angle camera right here in the front it's not the highest resolution but it's good and very responsive which is nice cuz i can see what's going on behind me always on my screen even if i can't see this is one of the most iconic parts of california the bay area san francisco the golden gate bridge and uh i'm driving over it on a cyber truck it's pretty amazing it's a beautiful day here in california support our stop burning stuff patreon and help us tackle misinformation about electric vehicles and clean energy let's talk about the exterior of this truck these doors actually make a great sound opening them is just this button right here push on it it comes out to greet you and then you grab it from here you could grab it from here but obviously there's the edge of the stainless steel and we should talk about this if we look at something a tussle model 3 you'll notice that the doors wrap right the metal is seamed and buted up that way there's no hard edges you can't do that with this cold rol stainless steel so you actually have edges and there are edges everywhere the only real exception are these these covers that go over the wheels again keeping with the polygon shape aesthetic cover up the edges of that but all the other stainless edges are exposed and that's kind of a weird thing that's not something i've ever seen in any other car we're normally used to big panels that are molded and bent but this is kind of angles and edges but the good news is it's not going to cut you it's pretty pretty well deburred and and and smoothed but yeah it is a really unique part about this truck moving on to the front this was how the truck was unveiled and they've stayed pretty much true to it there's a ever so slight bend right here by the way this is the only real curvature in the entire stainless steel body this front bumper and then one hard crease right here all the way to there big light bar for good illumination and lighting on the road and then you've got some fog lights and indicators below all of that below here this is not stainless this is the only part that's actually plastic and it goes around the entirety of the truck to round it all out but my favorite view is from around here the 2/3 or the quarter view and the side view is really striking honestly charge port right here this is where the uh charge door is typically in other teslas it would be in the tail light but there's no real tail light that wraps around so the charge port goes right there we had no problem charging it at a normal tesla charging site just pull up to the stop and uh the the cables reach just fine coming on to the back this reminds me a lot of the rivan actually right here's the tailgate release very soft closed and soft open again the rivan you have outlets back here you have two 110s and a 240 which is nice so you can just plug in typical household stuff and you can even plug in a 240 thing you can even plug in a 240 outlet here and charge another ev or power your house so that's kind of kind of a cool touch and this will be the first tesla to be able to do that big light strip that runs all the way across to the entire bed is illuminated again the hexagon design language extends all the way to here look at this in the bed you've got kind of the bend right there and the bed kind of radiates upward and you've got hooks that you can adjust and you can latch them to wherever you want to be in terms of size let's see i'm about 6 ft tall and okay so i can't get my head all the way in but my feet are flat there and i'm pretty much in so about a 6 foot bed i would say now it does flare right here for the passenger seat to reclined so you do lose a little bit of space that way but uh otherwise it's a pretty easy little bed and i'd imagine it's about on average with other trucks oh there's one more thing there's more thing to talk about all right so speaking of truck stuff one of the most iconic parts about this truck is this part right here which is pretty unconventional this is called a wing pillar and it's actually structural most trucks are body on frame meaning all the loadbearing capacity is on a ladder frame under the truck this doesn't have that this is a unibody construction with an exoskeleton component and as a result this part right here this meat is really what gives stability to the bed and keeps it from crumpling or other horses and keeping it all together the tailgate has a counter spring so closing it is incredibly easy look at this there's no real weight to it it's actually quite easy to bring up and then if we close the tunnel cover now this tunnel cover feels really high quality really well built um much higher i' said in the rivan which just had problems for us even in our test car that we had it would bind up and things this actually worked really well and it's really sturdy all those footprints are from ryan the owner of this truck who jumps on it and does all that kind of stuff i'm not going to do that it's not my truck i'd hate to you know i've been i've been working out been losing some weight but i'm not comfortable enough to get up there just yet otherwise down here you have your lighting strip that's where the tail light brake light is and again the hexagon design aesthetic even extends to this little protrusion for the rear [music] camera on the inside it's classic tesla right there's no gauge cluster in front of me just a cavernous view the view actually reminds me of the canoe honestly there it just goes and goes forever i can't even reach the end not even close and then the view is pretty [music] options to to raise this up to a high setting for extract which is if you get stuck some in the mud but here very high i you can see but i'm really half the ground i think it has about 8 in of dynamic right height adjustment from you know from kind of average you have four below and four above and i'm not sure if that's included in the extract setting which i think you're not really supposed to use except for when you're stuck in the money you get out of it but really impressive very similar to the rivan and if you're not in an off-road mode when you start driving over 25 mph it'll lower you down so the dynamics of the car it just feels a car not a truck so this is how it looks to have the truck at the full ride height now it's actually taller than me and i think for this truck it looks better this way there's it's more of a domineering presence on the road and as a truck i think it just looks better at its lowest heght it kind of felt a low rider which is not exactly my vibe for a truck but of course you don't pick and choose cuz all that stuff is just adjustable thanks to the air suspension now let's take a look at the front trunk that's actually pretty intuitive but the button to release it is right here there is that cyber truck lettering this is actually kind of pressed on a on a plastic panel here interestingly the smallest front trunk of any of these pickup trucks right the rivan is massive the for 50 lightning huge this is much much smaller in fact if you remember in my ford f-150 lightning i actually was able to fit inside the frunk i'm not going to fit inside this one but i do think that the compromise makes a lot of sense because what they've done is they've moved all of that space that would have been an engine in a big gas truck if this is the front wheel the truck would come out to here and you'd have a big gas engine here they've moved all that into the passenger compartment and further back and further back into a bigger bed that's probably the better thing to do there is still space in enough for groceries or other things if you needed to in a pinch but again you will be facing the edges of that stainless here come take a look at this this is there's probably not other vehicle in the world where you'll see the edges of it quite so much as this but yeah it is it is pretty soft you're not going to cut yourself or [music] [applause] anything [applause] this one of those cars that people said they'll never make it's just vaporware and now that we're actually seeing it when i drove up here from san diego to film this i saw two different trucks hauling cyber trucks for owners up here in in northern california so these things are about to be prolific you're going to start see them on the roads especially in california obviously but even in other places one of the crazy things about this car too is here's a left turn you ready that's it because of the variable steering input at different speeds driving around a car park or you know a residential neighborhood is so easy it makes it you you're not turning hand overand and uh just makes it that much easier and then on the freeway it's actually really nice too because the inputs get reduced and and you know you can move the wheel a little bit and have much more finer control at high speeds these are systems that we've had in the past bmw i remember had a variable steer ratio system uh but this is the first such system that is entirely steer by wire meaning that i'm holding a playstation 5 controller here this is a driving simulator at this point and all the car was doing is taking my input and then from there figuring out what what to do and does a really good job of it and this takes us to the elant in the room the price and range which are the two sticking points for most consumers and rightfully so this is the dual motor which was promised at 400 m of range and it's actually stating about 340 but in our testing we're seeing about 470 wat hours per mile which means that the range with a 223 k battery pack is closer to 260 miles at 70 miles hour in the freeway now your mileage may vary of course but that's not nearly as close as what tesla said and of course the tri motor doesn't get 500 miles of range it gets even less because of all the extra motors involved and of course the prices have gone up too this foundation series is closer to $100,000 which is $50,000 more than tesla claim that the dual motor would cost this will be the most polarizing electric vehicle ever made honestly whether you it or not will depend on how you feel about the future how about the apple vision pro another look at the future and just the cybertruck it's bold it's ambitious and i'm glad they made it is this a tour to forest in terms of engineering yeah it really is the 40 evil architecture steer by wire these are things that will make their way into all vehicles in the future but childhood me is just happy to know that a vehicle this exists it's bold it's ambitious it's a risk tesla knew that when they made it just look at it at every angle that i look at it from it just screams engineering and the future and that's what it should be but what do you guys think sound off in the comments below and if you this you got to check out this next",3
Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfHtiJwiepCu_qwONFRaS06p,Dlnd0m6T40w,"[music] we're at the rivan r2 event and it is right here behind me and oh my god oh my god they did the one more thing thing and actually have two other cars the r3 and the r3x we'll get into all that here but this is a look at chapter 2 of rivian's how to build a new car company playbook chapter 1 the r1t r1s iconic brilliant cars that were very up market low volume and this is what comes next so this then is a really quick first look at the rib r2 welcome to fully charge sh fully charged then you'll love our fun-packed everything electric expos around the world next up we're in london and harriet remember energy and transport professionals go free on the first [music] day we have just a little bit of time to try to give you a walk around we're going to be completely surrounded by people so i don't know how much we're going to be able to do let's see how this chapter 2 of rivan's playbook is going to look looking at the r2 you might not even notice the new car cuz it looks so similar to the r1t and r1s it all starts up front the most iconic part of any rivian is the front look at that beautiful light bar that runs all the way across the entire front of the car and of course the vertical oval lights which is about as classic rivan as it gets and all that is shared here in fact the entire car just kind of looks the r1s just shrunk down for example the wheelbase is about 5 in shorter the big dimensional change is in the length almost 15 in shorter in terms of the full length and that's where this car makes that compromise the r1s is a seven seater with a third row this is five seats only and two rows and that's where really that big difference happens terms of height about 5 in shorter and uh about 4 in is narrower so overall similar dimensions it's they just kind of shrunk it down you know just everything about it shrunk down but they've kept a lot of the character and love and i'm telling you right now if you didn't know this was a new car and you just parked it out in the street odds are people probably wouldn't even notice they would have just thought oh okay it's the rivan r1s but when you park them side by side it becomes much more apparent right so one of the big changes here with the r12 is simplification right this car starts at $45,000 how do you think have all that money for for example this car has traditional shocks and mechanical metal springs right no air suspension here no dynamic ride height adjustment and all the other cool settings the r1s has this is a little more standard and in terms of batteries and stuff here's what we know there's going to be cylindrical 4695 batteries so a little bigger than what tesla is using but the big cylindrical batteries in a structural battery pack so this skateboard architecture in their next generation product is going to have a structural battery that means that the batteries and the casing for them aren't just an enclosure for the pack they actually provide the structural rigidity especially torsal rigidity for the entire car that's pretty cool also we know that the range is going to be 300 plus i've heard reports over 320 mi we don't know how big the battery pack is going to be but as you can tell this is not a small car and it doesn't have that fastpack roof line so i'd imagine this will have aund and something kill our battery pack but i'm just guessing we'll know more about that in the coming months so around the back again very classic rivan big embossed letters got the big light bar all the same stuff that we saw in the r1f now we mentioned to me a car from 88,000 90,000 to 45,000 requires a ton of optimizations right you have to lower the cost of every subcomponent but i'm really glad to see that rivan didn't go too bones for example this window rolls down kind of the tot to wrap forward of the past i love and also these back windows pop out so it's just kind of a back pressure to keep that air moving really nice touches for a car in this price point again this competes with the tesla model y and looking at it it feels it's an another class compared to the model y right just a little bit bigger more [music] room [music] and here is the site for sar that's and is the north american charging standard the tesla charge port here on the car this car in 2026 when it comes out will come with that which is fantastic cuz that is the right choice for us here in north america you've probably seen cars with seats that f flat this is a great example a truly flat back but have you ever seen a car where the front seats f flat well that's what we have here this means that from this both the driver and passenger seats pulled fully flat kind of in line with the center console which means this can make for some epic camping with just an air mattress that covers the entire area that's clever to do that the headest has to come out and for the driver's side the steering wheel goes in and down to accommodate that folding action i don't think i've ever seen that before brilliant so in the r1 there used to be a speaker right about here but by removing that you have all this extra space for larger water bottles and other things that you can put in here and those speakers have been relocated to other parts of the center console also every rivan has this no this is not a rolls-royce but every rivan has a flashlight right here you can just pop out for adventures right this is an adventure and lifestyle vehicle but what's really cool is they're working on a series of different accessories that you could put in here for example the next one would be a hand warmer and usb battery pack how cool that be you're going out somewhere cold you could pop it out hold on to it keep your hands warm one of my favorite parts about the r1s was always the front trunk and rj the ceo mentioned that it's really popular with their customers as well this one not as big the r1s is massive but this one's still usable there's a little bit more of a border around it but still quite large and you can fit airline luggage and stuff that right so this then is the r3 and as you can tell it's quite a beautiful thing it actually looks very rivan from the front and in my mind i was thinking and this is probably a lot the ionic 5 but standing here now it's quite a bit bigger this actually is more suv really than hot hatch it'd be hard to call this a hot hatch this probably really is more of a really really compact suv just because i mean look how tall it is it's a big car but it does really make the most of the interior space there's good seating for five hatchback space good aerodynamics kind of has a good little package all around i'm really curious how the sales figures compare the timelines we'll know more about all that in the future this was just a really cool leak kind of a early look but yeah exciting stuff all right this is the one more thing one more thing this is the r3x the giveaway for this compared to the traditional r3 is the wider flares here for bigger tires this is kind of the off-road pack right but again looking at it from the front just classic rivan i mean they have a clear design language and this just fits right into the family obviously with the sportback and more hot hatch styling it does look a little bit different compared to the r2 but again very familial in its ancestry and dna and you can tell what it is really cool little highlights as well on this car the mirrors and the tow hooks which have that orange color which is really cool right so i was talking with the team and they mentioned the biggest giveaway is this right here so the rivan lettering right here on the fender well is probably the biggest giveaway that this is a r2 product or an r3 product versus the originals here in the back again just classic rivan light bar big raised letters and the hatchback opens two ways so the entire door opens and also just the top glass which is a really nice touch and the back glass can be programmed to open and stay open at different settings so if you have a surfboard for example you could put it out the back and just have it open and and kind of hold itself there [music] fantastic so what we see here behind us the r2 the r3 the r3x this is the future of rivan literally right here in front of you as they mentioned they're trying to speed up the timelines to get this car out especially r2 which they're going to be producing at their current normal illinois facility which is really cool and they're target tting a 2026 timeline but we shall see ultimately all the lessons learned have to be instilled in these cars they have to be profitable and they have to be great but one thing i can tell you for sure is that people are going to love them i mean just look at how much character they have but what do you think are these cars cars you would want and tell me that that r3 wouldn't be amazing on british or european roads as well just amazing all right that is a really really quick look at the rivan r 2 and r3 r3x here in beautiful southern california and if you thought that was cool check out this next",2
Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfHtiJwiepCu_qwONFRaS06p,wuACZvjH7tc,"[music] have you noticed that most cars in the pursuit of better aerodynamics and efficiency are starting to look the same well that is not true for this car this is the aptera and it's one of the most efficient cars money can buy and it looks nothing else you'll see on the road jack was here two years ago in beautiful southern california to drive one of these but now fast forward 2 years and production intent models are coming off the line line and they believe that manufacturing and shipping to customers will happen in about a year's time so we thought we'd come back out and give you an update on ata welcome to the fully charg show love the fully charge show join us live in canada this september the south in october and australia and london in 2025 so with the epa you got to start with the solar panels up front we have the solar on the hood then you have solar on the dash by the way you see that down there on the roof and of course on the back hatch lit as well now one thing that has changed from when we first saw the aptera is that that is now glass before they were using a polycarbonate but in the interest of longer lasting and better performance and scratch resistance all those panels are going to be glass it's going to be pretty amazing also here you get a good look at the mirrors because of us regulations you have to have an actual physical mirror they've got that plus cameras which we can show you here on the inside you've still got the full fairing wheels as before now this is the gamma model so there are some changes between this and production and we'll highlight those as we go but as we move along the back here look at this window and this is as you can imagine what was required to get that to open into the door speaking of doors check this out opening the door has a knock sensors right behind the logo and you got the actuated butterfly doors coming along to the back another big change is that the hatchback opening is going to extend all the way i think that's probably a smart move because otherwise you're going to scratch this up as you load things in and out and we'll show you that here as we talk about it so here is a production intent model and you can see here with the stamped part this is part of the opening and extends all the way to the back one of the things about the aptera that caught my eye from the very beginning was their choice even before it was a thing to use the tesla charge port the nacs port if you will just because of how slim and lowprofile it is it fits very well here on the tail lid but that is actually now a thing they were one of the early companies to petition for the us to use that charging standard and uh i'm really glad they did interestingly the aptera is classified as an autocycle which has some interesting ramifications here in the us for example it's closer to a motorcycle in terms of designation which means the headlight has to be in the middle right you would normally on a motorcycle have the headlight right in the middle which denotes that it's a smaller vehicle so even though this is much larger it has the headlights out in front earlier prototypes had them on the sides and in europe that might be the opposite because i believe they have to have the lights out as far as possible so instead of individual hub motors on each wheel they've decided to go with this a vesco emr 3 150 kw electric motor now this will be mounted in board right around here with true drive axles to either wheel part of the reason why is this is a tried and true motor and controller and inverter that's been used on millions of vehicles already so when you already have a spaceship and carbon fiber monoco tubs and so much other innovation going on the last thing you need is to overdo it so i think starting with this kind of makes sense this is 150 kow as i mentioned and interestingly i realized that this inverter design is what made it difficult before also with having hub motors you'd have two different inverters two different controllers and this just kind of simplifies that entire process all-wheel drive models in the future might have a hub motor for the back but for the launch edition you're looking at the powertrain and for a vehicle that weighs 2200 lb this should be quite [music] py so chris from when last we met a couple years ago and we drove one of those what's changed and how's it going yeah you know this was made made uh very much the same way that i made my boats resin infused composits so you've got an aside mold and you lay your material in the mold and then you put a bag on top and then you put it under vacuum pressure basically you inject resin in one side of the part and it flows to the other uh the problem is it has to stay under bag for four or five hours so the cycle time is not great so when we got you know our first 10,000 orders we said well we better start investigating new methods on how to do this composits or we're going to have hundreds of thousands of square feet full of molds in southern california which is very expensive and you're going to have a lot of labor content to actually produce these parts so we we started looking and a coach our um um bp of engineering went out and found a process called uh carbon fiber smc a carbon fiber sheet molding compound is what it stands for and instead of just an aside mold where you lay in the the material you've got an a and a b-side mold so clamp together a waffle iron and you put in thermoset resin and carbon fiber goo and when you close the waffle iron everything squishes out and in about 8 minutes you have a part so this is really conducive to our big parts as well uh but it's pretty cool to see the process and see how big the parts are and just know that you know it can match our tac time so if we want to build you know 50 100,000 a year we can do it with this process got you want to show us what you're talking about yeah i see it over here in the corner so the the green parts evolved into these white and black parts and the black parts are carbon fiber smc and uh you'll hear it in the supercar world watch the edges are kind of sharp there trimmed um but in the supercar world they call it forged composits so when you see it in um bmws and ferraris and lamborghinis uh they put a clear coat on it so it's a little shinier and they call it forged composits um but it's just a beautiful looking carbon fiber short strand part that's really tough uh this is a great example of the technology because usually for a big hatch this you would have an inner and an outer in aluminum or steel and you clamshell them together and then you'd weld the seams right uh this is just one one part but it's got a&b surfaces you've got you know you got features for the the seal uh you've got bonding uh ripples so the uh solar panel can glue onto it nicely and this is it this is the whole part one one piece and done so from a couple of hours to get a panel out to a couple of minutes to 8 minutes the smaller the part the quicker it is so the small parts come out in you know three or four minutes the big parts it takes time for the heat to get into the thermost set resin uh so they take longer but this is the world record holder for the largest carbon fiber smc part and uh it's not just a big part a the toyota truck bed uh this is a very complex part it's got a lot of features it does a lot of things uh not only on the bottom side to hold a lot of things underneath but also the top side to to run wires and um you know mount the seats and have crosscar rigidity so we got a lot of rigidity from this um rear brace in the back and then we add an aluminum crosscar beam here to give us a lot of rigidity in the front but it's uh it's a marvel of engineering for sure and obviously lightweight so two technicians could pick this up and put it into a jig for bonding you don't need a lot of robots to pick up really heavy metal stuff and position it and put it everywhere um you know this is uh human positionable no welding no painting it makes for much friendlier manufacturing environment and the structural part of this vehicle is just this the top spider up there that roll hoop this cowl and the two sides that's it six parts and done wow so all the all the block that we see is carbon fiber so how about the white pieces up here uh the white pieces are actually glass so uh in lot of areas you don't need super rigid uh composits this uh you can get away with um you i wouldn't call them more cosmetic components but uh less stiff components and obviously it's much much cheaper to do it out of fiberglass and do it out of carbon fiber uh so it saves us money uh doesn't add uh any significant weight um and you know this is this is how it's done [music] now again this is not a production model but let's just take a quick look here on the interior couple things will be pretty much as you see here you'll have a rear viiew camera mirror up here because the early models will come with a full solar panel back which is the way i'd option it as well and again you have your traditional mirrors that are mechanical and physical but you also have the cameras the screen is a little bit small to fit nicely in the cabin and you're going to have some controls on the steering wheel and i think it's it's going to be just one color but the biggest change on the interior actually has to do with the manufacturing improvement and that's around the gear tunnel as you can see here the old gear tunnel and gear tunnels this that run the length of the car are largely for rigidity and for structural integrity and this one is so massive that it didn't leave as much room but check out this thanks to their new forge carbon fiber manufacturing process this gear tunnel is reduced that much and the integrity is retained in other components and stamps on the entirety of the tub as a result now that center console area is going to be a lot larger for storage and whatever else also the passengers are moved closer in board to maximize space especially on the walls and just a million small little things but by and large it's the car that you all love and it's just getting closer and closer to being ready for manufacturing again this is the gamma this is not the full final production which would go all the way over but let's take a look at the space back here i love that that's just the coolest thing again even though this is a pretty small compact car it is absolutely massive back here about 7 feet i think and um if you have this all the way up for camping we've showed that in previous episodes where you have camping accessories and everything else but this is a really practical car but what do you think would you buy the aptera i'd love to know sound off in the comments below and maybe we'll see one of these things at an everything electric show in the near future all right that is a quick look at the updates happening at attera and if you haven't thank you so much for watching [music]",-1
Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfHtiJwiepCu_qwONFRaS06p,lYkfrUtz8c8,"[music] we're in beautiful hollywood california at the hyundai ionic 9 unveiling now this is not the iic 9 this is the onic 5 one of the most iconic instant classic cars in the ev era but it looks nothing the ionic 6 the car over here so what would hyundai do for the biggest car they've ever made gas or electric let's find out and here it is this is the hyundai ionic 99 and it's pretty similar to what was promised as a prototype 3 years ago but as their largest model including their gas cars this thing's kind of a master class in packaging so here's a quick first look at the hyundai onic 9 i'm ricky welcome to f chart [music] show the ionic 9 will come in three variations the rear wheel drive which has a 160 k motor out back the all-wheel drive which has a 70 kow in front and a 160 in the back and the performance all wheeel drive which has a 160 in front and back now the stated range figures of 330 mi is for the rear wheel drive variant on 19in rim so depending on where you live and which trim you get the range is going to vary but imagine it'll be around 300 mi for the all-wheel drive variant by the way you'll notice here this little windshield cover obviously you have your camera and your light sensor but there's more to it if you look at the roof of this car there's no roof antenna typically you'll see cars that have a shark fin antenna on top of the roof for things gps and radios but that isn't here that has been entirely removed and instead placed in areas this or the instrument panel or the rear tailgate glass there's that much obsession with aerodynamics all interest of getting as much range as possible from that nmc 110 kil hour battery pack and thanks to the fact that it's an ev this wheelbase is the widest of any hyundai at 3.13 m or 123 in that's 9 in longer than the gas version the hyundai palisade and overall this car is actually 2 in longer as well than the palisade the gas equivalent but it doesn't feel it it feels pretty compact in a way it hides its size and one thing we should also mention is that on the inside you can either have this bucket seat for three people for a total of seven passengers or you can have captain's chairs and depending on which market you're in you can even have the option for swiveling captain's chairs you can have the chairs in the front swivel backwards i believe when it's parked to give you that sense of belonging all right obviously the space is pretty good with all three rows up but to fold the seats flat it's as simple as pushing buttons back here for those two and then straps for the for the back two and you got a pretty much a full flat floor for all your activities that's pretty [music] cool okay now let's talk about the interior first thing you'll notice is that the doors make a fantastic sound and that's because there's been a focus on reducing noise vibration and harshness all the glass is laminated front and back and there's extra padding materials to dampen out the road noise to make it nice and quiet also from the seven prototype there were a lot of ellipses on that prototype that were lit up and they've kind of carried that across you can kind of see here circular door handles and this kind of round here matches here on the back and kind of brings it all together so they've kept some of that magic and the parametric pixels carry through with these indents on all the seatbacks and even here on the steering wheel very iconic hyundai at this point now for the controls it's pretty conventional and there's a lot of touch you've got climate control knobs here for the dual passenger climate you have capacitive touch buttons here and these are all physical buttons volume knob and adjustments and everything else you have your hazard lights right there and of course you've got your touchcreen up top but if you're a person who likes more physical gauges and knobs you'll appreciate this this is the dry fluor down here and you've got all your steering wheel controls and i believe this changes the level of regen here but pretty nice layout you've got a camera up here and you've got cameras out in front of the car because this car has pretty decent ad das advanced driver assist systems to help you with lanee keep and uh laser guided cruise control and everything else you've got blindside monitoring and all the traditional stuff one thing that i love and this is something i wish every car had is 100 wat usbc charging for both there's two up here and then a traditional usb probably for audio and you've got two in the back and two in the third row as well you have six 100 wat usb chargers and all those come off of the high voltage battery system not the 12vt so even when you're parked or other things you're not going to be running down the 12volt battery you'll be running off of the main battery again the parametric pixel layout and design happens here for the soft touch points for the phone and even here for the wireless charging component but there's my phone wirelessly charging you've got drive terrain controls up in here and a pretty nice little center console now higher trim levels will have a full pullout drawer for the back and this entire center console can slide forward and a that way you can set it to wherever you want to make it as easy to reach as possible here in the second row the language carries are cross we have your lipes back here door handles what's really nice is the window folds all the way down which of course it's not working now i think it's because the car is not on windows go all the way down which is a nice touch also you've got sun shades back here and these are really big and they go all the way across i really that that's a feature i wish i had also cup holders here and here you got your bow sound system vents up here and then you got your controls here for your heated seats and all your hvac controls now depending on which trim you have if you have the captain chairs this is the seven seat configuration but if you got the six seat you could have massaging chairs as well really nice touch here is that this inner cabin actually opens both ways so it's a dual way hinge otherwise fully flat floor and really great adjustability for the seats and you mentioned to get into the final row you hit that button seat comes up and over and look at how much room you have and that's probably a good segue to talk about the seating position test i'll try to sit behind myself where i would be in all three rows let's try that out first seat this is where i would drive again i'm 6 ft tall quite comfortable this is a a good seting position now if i were to sit behind myself i'd be probably right about here again plenty of room even if you were 65 jack i think you'd fit just fine head room is massive as well now let see how i fit behind myself on the third [music] row so i don't know if you can see that my knees have pretty decent space and that row could go up a little bit further or not be reclined let's try that let's do a little bit less of a recline maybe if i was back here i'd make my passenger drive that and there we are now this is pretty normal i've been in third row suvs evs that have that much room back here but what's really special is that so even though they have the roof taper look at how much room i have back here now to give you that good look down the entire cabin of the car to see that boattail taper this is probably the best you to do so you can kind of see just how cavernous it is up top and how everything about the car kind of tapers down now really big cars could potentially have a third row with three seats in it but this is more common these days where you have just two but yeah you can kind of see the whole car taper here along the back but you still have a decent siz opening along the back here i kind of wish this was a little bit closer to flush so you can get wider things in but that's going to be pretty awesome and back here you've got a 120 outlet 240 for you guys in the uk and there's also some really interesting cool tech that they've got for helping you tow the american models can pull 5,000 lb the uk models can pull 25 200 kilograms but there's some advanced driver packages to help you with towing now what's interesting about this car as well is that nothing protrudes out for example check out this ionic 9 logo it's actually embossed and it doesn't actually stand out at all and the hyundai logo up here is obviously just in the glass but everything is really flat and flush all the headlights are all behind uniform polycarbonate and it's all just really flush the same is true on the front logo as well it used to be a lot thicker and stand out but obviously in the interest of aerodynamics look how fl that is now it is still a logo but it's just very flat also this car i did ask in north america we have the nacs charging standard which is huge that would be for me one of the biggest attractions to actually buying a car this now styling this objective and you might love or hate it that's going to be up to you i personally think it's a really well executed car i think it looks great i'm a fan of it and in the us we love these third row suvs especially ones where the seats fold flat and you have all that extra room this is a car that will definitely sell well here in north america and honestly from certain angles it has a little baby range rover look to it so for people in the market for larger cars in europe you have another option as [music] well so that's a really quick look at the allnew hyundai ionic 9 obviously styling is going to be your own personal preference i personally think it's rather good-looking and really well carried out and i love the obsession with aerodynamics i think it leads to a car that gets really good range for how big the battery pack is i've always found it really interesting with hyundai and the ionic line not having a uniform design language the five and the six look nothing alike this is probably closer to the five but because each car will look radically different unveilings actually really matter because it'll determine how the next models will look i also asked them if the concept prototype was the ionic 7 prototype why wasn't this the ionic 7 and they mentioned that this being the biggest hyundai they've ever made bigger than the padate even this is the nine and that leaves them room for the potentially seven or eight that is a really quick first look at the ionic 9 until next week check out this and if you have been thank you so much for watching [music]",-1
Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfGMSJzuD7aCZZsMBqUlGz18,gi74aTWkyv0,foreign [music] well hello and welcome to fully charged welcome to the munich motor show 2021 welcome to the vw stand one of the biggest stands at the show as you would expect at a german motor show and we're here for what i think might just be the most important car unveiled at this year's show it's not this this is nice this is the vw id5 gtx the id4 big electric bus suv id5 same thing but with a swoopy bottom gtx the fast one with all-wheel drive very nice but a couple beefs with it and a couple beefs with electric cars in general for being honest it's quite big and well it's quite expensive and the questions that you guys ask us in the comment section of every that we make ever quite rightfully is when are the small cheap electric cars coming well the answer as it turns out is 2025 because this is the vw id life concept and it's a teaser for vw's sub 20 000 pound compact electric car that will be coming in four years time four years i know i know it's a long time i know i wish it was next year too but look we'll take it okay small cheap electric cars are coming and this is our first glimpse at what they might look so allow me to walk you through some of the details of this car and sort of elbow some german people out the way to make sure that we get good shots so then the vw id life concept what is the deal well first let me give you the grown up sensible information then we'll move on to the silly concepty stuff because who doesn't love some silly conception stuff this as i mentioned is a sort of glimpse at what vw's polo size compact sub 20 000 pound electric car might look when it arrives in 2025 so we have a date now 2025. it's going to use a shortened version of the meb platform the same one used on the id3 the enyak the id4 the cooper born and about a zillion other cars they've got a squashed version of it that they're going to use for this and also for an equivalent sized equivalent priced skoda and cupra in fact if we go over to the cooper stand which we'll do as part of our best of show roundup make sure you go watch that you will see what i think is the cupra equivalent of this and it's it's quite different now we don't have a huge amount of information on this car as you would expect from a concept car but a couple of things i want to pick up on first of all compact yeah it's quite big i don't know if we're supposed to judge its dimensions maybe they've made it bigger so it's easier to see it's a motor show but uh i think quite large to me it's also a bit taller than you might expect from a small city car because it's a urban crossover whatever on earth one of those is i'm not gonna get crossed about that i'm just happy that small cheap electric cars are coming um this is not the moment for an suv related tantrum jack focus front wheel drive that's quite interesting because every mab car that we've had so far has either been rear wheel drive or all-wheel drive this one the motor is mounted in the front much more the traditional small city hatchbacks that we know and love from the ice days i'll treat you to some stats although they are completely irrelevant at this stage kilowatt hour battery 250 mile range get this you ready 234 brake horsepower uh for this front wheel drive uh electric compact city thing doubt it well maybe for the top spec one when that comes but you can rest assured there will be slower cheaper versions of whatever this car turns into in the next few years and then we're into the really really conception stuff for example the roof and the bonnet are made from inflatable cells it looks to me uh a sort of sleeping bag tent sort of material i the idea of being able to unzip my roof you're coming out of a festival with a hangover that's a nice idea it won't make production of course it won't nor will the inbuilt projector which raises out of the dash and beams a film onto the nearest wall so that when you're in a car park waiting or charging you can you can watch a film on the wall that's directly across from you fantastic [music] interior is extremely concept-y at this point there's not an awful lot to see in there although that is allegedly deliberate because vw claims that your phone this is a phone is going to be very central to the user interface in the car in other words you'll plug the phone into the dash and it will sort of serve as your infotainment you'll be able to navigate menus on your phone through buttons on the touchscreen not super sure how i feel about that if it's integrated well it could be very handy if not it could be the most annoying thing in the world it could also not happen at all and just be a concept car feature we're not really sure look the important thing to focus on in this car is that a small cheap electric vw is happening this is the type of car that the world has been crying out for and halfway through this decade long overdue i know we're finally going to get not one but three from vw group we're gonna get whatever this turns into from vw we're gonna get an equivalent cupra and we're gonna get something from skoda small electric city cars that cost less than 20 grand are finally coming people praise the lord so there we go a short and sweet on a very significant what's it made of this material it's a bit a bathroom i think it's all very recycled plastics i'm getting sidetracked the vw id life a very exciting concept car marking the imminent arrival of the small cheap electric vehicles that we so crave there we have it short and sweet let us know in the comments what do you make of it what do you make of its zippy tent roof and its uh projector and other bizarre features that probably won't make production i'm just i'm just rambling at this point aren't i if you have been thank you for watching [music] [applause] [music] well if you enjoyed that episode you're going to love this one and this one too is very relevant to the topic and also if you want to to fully charge which is a wonderful thing to do really helps us cost you nothing you just up there it's really simple and if you do want to support

Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfGMSJzuD7aCZZsMBqUlGz18,BFeBg6jJ6Fo,foreign [music] [music] [music] [music] hello and welcome to the munich motor show coming to you live from well munich the middle of town most motor shows happen in a hall somewhere and this one they've sort of split it in half 50 the show in a big expo centre on the outskirts of munich the other the other half is right here in the town centre and there is so much cool new stuff on display at this year's show we're gonna go have a look at some of it in this we are gonna dedicate specific videos to certain brands mercedes needs its own because they brought out so much likewise vw a couple very important cars we give them their own but all the other stuff that's on display in this right here so come on let's go have a look this is fully charged [music] right welcome to the audi stand or as audi calls it the house of progress so german have a look at this thing it's called the grand sphere concept and first things first it's a big long boy i think pushing six and a bit meters very concepty but a magnificent piece of design audi are on fire with design they have been for a while now and this is no exception it's described in the press materials as a private jet for the road it's emphasizing the front seat occupants it's not something you sit in the back of you chill in the front actually at the push of a button the steering wheel retracts full self-driving feet up chill out that's all very concept-y and fantastical but i think what is important here is the design language much that porsche over there this probably provides some clues as to future audi design language so i'm looking at those very skinny headlights and thinking okay we might be seeing those on new audi's in a couple of years time likewise the grill the grill is an audi signature the big open mouth that is a very uh famous audi feature and it seems they are gonna hold on to it as we enter this electric era even though they don't really need them interesting [music] well here is a surprise star of the show we didn't know this thing was going to be here until it was unveiled a couple of days ago this is the porsche mission r here's the deal in 2025 porsche wants to have a customer electric only race series and this car theoretically teases what the cars in that series might look so what have we got over a thousand horsepower in qualifying trim weighs about 1500 kilos the batteries are actually mounted just behind the driver they would be in a mid-engined ice supercar which is really good news for weight distribution it's also the reason it has the shape that you see here but off the record the other thing that's quite interesting about this is well it's sort of boxster cayman size and actually there are some schools of thought that what we might be seeing here are some clues as to the design cues we may see on the electric porsche boxster and cayman that are going to be coming quite soon look at it [music] [applause] [music] oh now then here's a car i've been waiting a very very very long time to clap my eyes on this is the koopra born the vw id3's sportier sibling the first electric hot hatchback and i'll tell you what it's a real good looking car in the metal i've always had a bit of a gripe with cooper's trademark blonde blonde bronze accents still not sold on them but generally such an aggressive purposeful looking car you put one of these next to an id3 the id3 would drive off scared really decent performance i think north of 200 brake horsepower the same battery options as you get in the id3 which means you can have more than 300 miles of range proper room for four because of that meb platform really usable rear seats decent sized boot and it's an electric hot hatchback my favorite type of car has finally gone electric between you and me we've just been invited to drive this thing at the press launch in a few weeks time so you'll know what we think about it to drive in a couple weeks i [music] so here's one of the more curious contraptions at this year's show this is the cupra taviscan extreme e concept cooper is bringing out an electric suv called the tabascan it comes in 2024 and to tease it what they've done is take some of the design language we're going to see on it and stick it onto the face of their extremity car it's an interesting marketing strategy it's a very cool thing also can i just say stood next to an extremely car you do realize how extreme they are that is a lot of suspension it's just a monster of a thing it's also mostly made from flax fibre so sustainable as well pretty cool and here is a third cupra for good measure this is the most outrageous of them all it's called the urban rebel concept and if you strip away all the very very motor sporty bits and the enormous wing what it actually is is cooper's new compact city electric car the sister car of the vw id life concept that we've seen in a different this in four years time will be a small vw polo sized cooper that you can buy with money theoretically for less than 20 000 pounds but for the concept they've gone absolutely mad they're giving it a colossal wing bucket seats race car interior the craziest wheels i've ever seen and a mad delivery oh and about 500 horsepower why not now here's a cool car that i was not expecting to see today this is the genesis x coupe concept genesis is about to tackle europe and they're bringing a fleet of very posh vehicles some of them electric we're getting the g80 in electric form which is a big s-class sized luxury thing that comes first then we get the gv60 that's a compact suv and a sister car to the ionic 5 and the kia ev6 that uses that same egmp platform but this is the one that i'm really excited about obviously the one that's not actually a production car is the one that gets jack excited this is just a sensational piece of design genesis have really strong design language this two stripe signature is a feature on all of their cars and apply it to a muscular two-door coupe this oh very very tasty we don't really have any two-door electric gt coupe a cars yet if genesis make the first one and it looked half this i'll be a very happy boy [music] well i think at this point we have to officially say hyundai is cool it's happened it's official look at this stand it's beautiful there's a waterfall over there on the hyundai stand love waterfalls but don't go chasing them anyway ionic six it's not new but i haven't seen it in the metal before and it is a fantastic looking piece of design i love this thing so much one thing i will say is i have seen a few spy shots of the test mule of the production car and it looks a bit different let's just say hopefully that's very clever camouflage because this is a masterpiece of design i really want a sporty slippery electric hyundai sports coupe in my life fingers crossed and then just over there behind a crowd of people is a hyundai ioniq 5 robo taxi this is built in conjunction with a self-driving technologies company called motional and this car has over 30 sensors a combination of lidar camera radar million other things and it's a sort of uh imagination of what self-driving electric taxis could look in the future also just seeing an ionic 5 with a load of cool sensors and cameras on it really suits the design of the car it's a really cool looking thing very back to the future [music] [music] so [music] [music] now then here's a vehicle i will never miss an opportunity to talk about when it's at a show this is the micro lino once again the v2 the 2.0 now with a few added mod cons this is one of my favorite small electric cars clearly very heavily influenced by the bmw i set a bubble car which is what 50 years old now takes that design refreshes it so the door is the front in you climb and then there's ample room for two plus bags over 20 000 pre-orders on this thing it's going into production next year really decent range i think about a 60 miles of urban range very very reasonable price do you want to hear something mind-blowing micro is the same micro as the little metal folding scooters from yesteryear in fact merlin the pr chat who i was just talking to his dad founded micro company was the creator of the folding metal scooter so all of those of you with bruises and scars on your ankles from childhood these are the people that you have to thank and there's a couple more cool things on this stand this is the micro letter just a concept at the moment but a very charming one a little vesper inspired three wheeled moped i hope that goes into production that's quite funky and then we have well any scooter they've come full circle hello there hello look they're back to scooters this one's electric it's quite fast front motor i can see a little bit of suspension going on very nice and finally this is really interesting it's called the gladiator which is a is a disproportionately cool name i would say given the product and how you would look riding it but it's a fantastic little thing merlin was telling me that they envisaged this being for people who work on enormous campuses you know you've got to get from one meeting to another and it's a 10-minute walk well the gladiator is here to help you but the star of the show for me is the micro lino here's the shell of one the second that we are invited we will be flying out to germany to film a review of this thing i cannot wait to have a go [music] right we're here at bmw stand in the centre of town bmw obviously being a german brand has a huge presence at the show this year nothing huge to report just over there we can see an i4 which i'm going to be driving very soon and cannot wait to have a go on we've also got a inex behind it which i remain convinced is an elaborate prank because there's no way someone designed that for money right anyway i digress one interesting thing that bmw has brought is in this room we can't actually get in there because there's an enormous queue and it's too hot and i'll die if we wait that long but we'll flash some images of it up it's called the bmw vision circular concept and it envisages what luxury will look in 2040. i'll give you a clue really big nostrils [music] something that's very noticeable at this year's show is the significant presence of chinese car makers they're coming and they're bringing some seriously high quality products to europe in the next couple of years this for example this is called the aura cat it's made by a brand called great wall motors bit of a strange name but not their strangest they used to make a van called the wingle five look into it so what is this well it's a sort of retro styled electric super minute it's quite a charming little thing actually range up to 250 miles priced at around 30 000 euro which is not super super cheap but actually i've had a look inside of it and it's really quite nice in there high quality materials lovely cabin design these chinese brands are no joke they need to be taken seriously at this stage they've got some really interesting products and you're going to see them on the road in europe as soon as next year very possibly the strangest thing at this year's show this is as you can clearly see a tesla model y but it's been converted to a hybrid by a company called oberys this is a hybrid tesla model y it's got a little two-cylinder petrol engine as well as a battery pack and the claim is that you get all the benefits and smoothness and quietness of an ev without having to worry about range anxiety [music] some people back to your regularly scheduled program [music] so this is quite interesting we're on the renault stand or at least it was the renault stand yesterday when we were here to have a quick look at the mcgann and the renault 5 concept they're gone now and the stand has been replaced it's now mobilized this is renault's new ride sharing particularly company and they've built all sorts of interesting things which are here today including this this is called the limo it's chinese built and it's designed specifically for ride sharing surfaces for ubers basically this is a car designed to be driven for uber drivers and it's going into production next year here's another one from mobilize it's called the hippo and it's a little teeny tiny cargo vehicle really cool thing about it the orange bit at the back the cargo space is interchangeable you can pop that module off and replace it with one that is refrigerated for example or one that's designed to deliver mail whatever your specific use case is the hippo can be customized to suit it and last but certainly not least we have this it's called the easy one named by ali g himself anyone no easy never mind what is it well it's it's fundamentally it's the spiritual successor to the twizy which means i automatically love it it's a small urban two-seater vehicle again all these mobility vehicles here on this renault stand mobilized sorry not available for purchase available for rent only and you rent them by the hour or by the minute or by the kilometer really interesting new way of thinking about cars [music] legs up oh well this is a highlight of my day welcome to the siemens stand and this is the siemens smart chopper no seriously this was designed back in 2009 by orange county choppers remember the show american chopper the very angry guy with the moustache and his even angrier son they made this bike for siemens back in 09 essentially just a very very cool marketing stunt and then a couple of years ago siemens revamped it gave it upgraded technology and paraded it at the goodwood festival of speed it's an electric chopper by siemens what's not to love [music] do you love the vw id4 but the back end isn't quite swoopy enough for you well vw has a solution this is the new vw id5 and it's the coupe version the sportback version as is tradition these days the e-tron has one the enyak's gonna have one next year and this is vw's one id5 here in gtx form which is the fast all-wheel drive model thankfully this camo won't be staying for production um but yeah there you go coupe id4 not much to say kind of cool what is very cool however is this see this vw id life concept this is the precursor to the small sub 20 000 pound electric car that vw will be making in 2025 using a shortened version of the mbb platform and if you want to know all the details on that go and check out our full on it [music] right we are back at the outside a bit of the show because again it's split into two parts the big motor show in the hall and then the outside a bit in the centre of munich that's where we are now at the mercedes stand and here is a smart concept now here's the interesting thing about the smart brand julie the enormous chinese company responsible for revitalizing revitalighting revitalizing lotus and volvo have thrown a load of money in to this company it's now about 50 mercedes 50 percent glee and if you look at what's happened to volvo and lotus in recent years that's very very good news julie do not mess around when they involve themselves in a company good things happen to that company and this is their first car it's the first car under the sort of julie era and it's called the smart concept one which is not a very imaginative name we don't know much about it in terms of the specs and the details it's about 4.2 meters long which means bye bye to the smug smart nose first parking maneuver and we're told it's about 75 production ready which is pretty impressive [music] well that just about concludes our coverage here at the munich motor show big takeaways from this year's show let's see number one small cheap electric cars are coming albeit not quite as soon as we wish that they were number two china is coming really quite soon with some properly competitive products but i think the main takeaway from this show is just how dominated by electric stuff it is normally in the past when we go to these kind of shows we sort of have to walk around all the noisy petrol stuff and pretend it's not there but we don't have that problem anymore because well there isn't very much of it on show in fact there was a quite a funny moment yesterday where cameraman andy started filming this posh looking chinese suv i had to tap on the shoulder and go hang on mate that's a p hev we just assumed it was electric because everything here is what a lovely problem to have there is so much cool new stuff coming in the uv space in the next couple of years it is snowballing now it's really gaining momentum and we're going to be very busy covering it all for you we can't wait anyway andy and i we came straight here from fully charged life so we're gonna go have a very long nap do let us know in the comments which of the cars shown in this do you want to see more about which ones shall we cover first when we are able to get our hands on them and if you have been thank you for watching [music] yes it's the great ev giveaway don't forget to and enter for your chance to win all sorts of prizes including one of four electric cars [music] you,2
Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfGMSJzuD7aCZZsMBqUlGz18,-y4LdgsidcU,welcome to the citron oe there's lots i could tell you about it the fact that somehow it is an suv and a pickup truck but it's not one feature of the oe that makes me so excited about it it's what it represents because what we have here is the embodiment of citron's belief that modern cars have become too big too heavy and too expensive and this right here this is the blueprint for how we fix that we know you love the fully charged show so why not come along to our global tour of live shows in 2023 and 24 next shows are in the uk specifically farm br and haraga so get your tickets [music] today where to begin well this is a priceless one-of a-kind concept car as you can probably imagine not destined for production anytime soon but our best clue yet into the future direction of the citron brand both in terms of design language and general philosophy so i think what we need to do now is just have a nosy round this thing there are so many features to talk about and what you're going to see very quickly is that everything every panel every screw on this car has been scrutinized and and carefully considered in the name of maximum affordability maximum sustainability and minimum weight and really the overarching way that they've achieved all of that is through simplicity let me show you what i mean worth noting it's quite small way smaller than you think in fact around 4.2 m by 1.9 m which means give or take it's mg4 sized if a little bit wider and yet this car weighs are you ready a ton one ton this thing weighs the same as a new lotus elise sports car it's an astonishing feat of engineering how have they done it well i'm going to show you in a minute ar they let's talk about these panels seriously made of cardboard specifically a corrugated recycled cardboard which is formed into a sort of honeycomb structure and then smook between two fiberglass reinforcing panels here's one i made earlier it's very hard very strong look cardboard seriously and around 50% the weight of equivalent steel coming around the side we see lots of examples of clever designed to create a really simple manufacturing process this is something we saw on the ami first time around but a lot of the components on the car are just kept really really simple so for example the door is identical on both sides it's the same piece that's just one less thing to have to manufacture likewise the bumpers front and rear those are the same these extended plastic wheel arches they are exactly the same as opposed to slightly different front and rear just to lower the cost of production ever so slightly why so flat flatter panels are easier and cheaper and lighter right why is the why is the windscreen completely straight up right this well because doing it that way uses the least amount of glass which means it cheaper to buy cheaper to replace and you may well be rightly looking at that and thinking well hang on that's an aerodynamic disaster this thing must have the efficiency of a front door but the thing you have to remember is when you are light aerodynamics not that important as far as efficiency as far as miles per kilowatt from its 40 kwatt modes sized battery it can pull just under 250 mi of range that's over 6 m per kilowatt hour and incidentally they have thought about this they have made an effort to ensure that the air flows over the car a little better than it otherwise would through very clever air duct just here inside both headlights comes out there air flows over the top of the car and just lessens the aerodynamic disaster that is that slab of glass should we go for a drive then that's allowed just a very little one indoors where we go in the citro o this is i think it's fair to say one of the most important cars i think i've ever covered for fully charged because what it represents is all the change that we so desperately want to see in the automotive industry we've seen boxy utilitarian electric cars before from sono in the form of the scion may it rest in peace and we've seen super efficient cars before that squeeze every last mile of range out of their batteries from lightyear with the zero may it rest in peace but we just haven't seen that kind of thinking from the legacy car brands we haven't seen an oem apply themselves to the task of an affordable efficient lightweight vehicle i still can't get that number out of my head 6.2 mil per kilowatt hour again just proof that losing the weight makes everything better when it comes to modern cars that is the key to efficiency not a super slippery 7 m long teardrop shape no just make it less heavy and then efficiency happens organically ah just over here in the corner of the hall we got a little citron amy parked up which of course in many ways is the car that started this whole idea for citron of simplicity affordability the idea of having you know doors and bumpers that are interchangeable front and back left and right all came from the ami [music] what we're going to see across this interior much the exterior is simplicity these are made using 80% less components than typical modern car seats just less to go wrong and some really beautiful details in here i love these 3d printed mesh back pieces honestly really quite comfortable citron says that these seats are easily upgraded as well which i suppose just means you just buy different sorts of stick on pads to fit your bottom better this dash 34 components just 34 pieces this entire dash and center console is made up of beautiful hollowed out 3d printed buttons i to think they're hollowed out to save that extra couple of grams because the weight saving in this car has been done to an obsessive degree give you a great example of that no sound system in the citron instead you've got mounts for two bluetooth speakers which you can then take with you to the beach upon arrival do you know how much that saves over a modern car about 250 g so if you have a big lunch you've ruined it speaking of charge and phones look look at this little special housing for your iphone you slide that in there in it clicks suppose you just have to have the model of phone compatible bit concept but cool and then what happens is your phone software will sort of fuse with the car's software and both will be accessible together through this long thin strip of screen you'll be able to customize your incar settings and access your apps all using this gaming style joystick on the steering wheel fun and let's just finish on the inside of these doors before moving into the back well i say inside of these doors normally doors have outer and inner panels but this one sort of just has an outer panel and then the rest has just been turned into a giant pocket lovely big squashy armrest no door handle here that's extra parts who needs them we've just got a nice little pull tab you know a ferrari f40 let's get into the back what you'll find with boxy designs is they're ever so roomy also suicide doors can we make those a thing on production cars look at this all the space in the world again 4.2 m this thing mg4 small hatchback sized and i've got room to recline back here head room for days and again just so many interesting little details everything in this interior by the way can be recycled as one you don't have to split it out into lots of different categories you just lump it all into the same box and off it goes to the recycling plant just to make things really really simple some really interesting material choices this is basically styrofoam but i'd it it sort of works it works as a kind of robust simple material it's it's more interesting than sort of nasty scratchy plastic in my opinion these railings onto which all the panels and cushions of the seat are fitted these for me in the back are available to mount various accessories on so as you can see i've got my tablet stuck on i've got my charging port i got my little housing for my earphones all mounted onto the back of these seats that is a beautiful piece of design and check these out these big squashy boys here this is basically extra suspension for each individual seat to maximize comfort inside the door more clever simple things we got a nice big storage bin we've got a nice squashy armrest no fancy electronic windows here my friend oh no just a little push to open situation because what more do you need it's [music] fabulous around the back i especially love the design of the lights both front and back they're really intricate if you get inside of it you can't quite tell where the beam is coming from and then this is a bit magic as well the back of this thing kind of hard to tell is it an suv is it a pickup yes yes is the answer because with some fiddling around and it is a bit fiddly because this is a concept you can turn this into a surprisingly long and spacious pickup truck i think the thing that just makes me so happy about this little concept is that yes we've got those principles of affordability and weight saving and sustainability that so desperately want to see from new cars but executed with a real sense of fun this is a car that just makes you smile look it's got these are rails to mount a gopro so that you can film yourself having adventures it's got roof racks to lash activity vehicles down to the roof of so you can take it i don't know white water rafting on the weekend i mean look at it it's just a silly happy little car it makes me happy so many people believe that making cars small to cheaper means making them worse and boring and less characterful but this thing's got more character coming out of it than 90% of modern evs that you can buy [music] today it's an absolute master class what i would say to citra now is now go and build these small affordable lightweight electric cars go and do it act on what you've done here and go and make all the other legacy car brands look a bit silly with their 2 and 1/2 ton palaces fingers crossed a glance into the future of car design and a very very important vehicle,2
Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfGMSJzuD7aCZZsMBqUlGz18,bLvKsdjDi_k,these are the silhouettes of some of the best electric performance cars on sale today brilliant cars all of them but based on just their shapes you wouldn't necessarily be able to tell that they're electric and that's because the people who designed them are perhaps unconsciously still just a little stuck in the design era of the petrol car and that begs the question what would a really fast ev look if you started from scratch [music] well you might end up with something a little bit this this is the bonkers era sedan and this is the fully charged shot [applause] a fully charged show is generating positive energy with its live events all around the world next up it's fully charged live canada the top right of the screen to get your tickets today welcome to the era sedan yeah bit mad this thing quite a looker would be fair to say and what we have here is a very high performance ev and a very italian answer to the question what happened if you harness the power of bespoke ev architecture not just to maximize legroom and cabin space but to maximize performance well the answer is something a little bit this something that resembles more a hot wheels car that i had as a kid than anything i've ever seen actually on the road with number plates and the really staggering thing is error assures us that what we have here is pretty far along this is a pretty damn good resemblance to the car that we're going to see on the road from error in early 2026 this of course is the second concept we've seen from error in the last eight or so months the other being the suv that suv which we did a very speedy walk around of at fully charged live uk south with its designer philippe perini former head of design at lamborghini they've gotten the big guns in for this project and this well for me even prettier even more striking and more dramatic let's just take a little look around the design and i'll pull a few details out for you and just a caveat there is going to be a little bit of background noise for context we're in milan we're at monza today this car is being unveiled to the world tomorrow and there's a motor show being very frantically built around us so if you see some quite stressed italian people running across shop with a ladder that'd be why and as we go through the design of this vehicle i want you to keep in your mind that idea of the blank sheet of paper the idea that this car was designed not using the stencils of ice cars of yesteryear but with clean slate and and this is what happens when you do that with a high performance electric vehicle you end up with for example a very stubby short little bonnet you don't need a bonnet there's no engine under there so bring the cockpit forward as much as possible really tiny little frontal area super low nose again that's immediately increasing the aerodynamic properties of the car you want the air to sweep over the top of it not be caught by this big frontal area so there sort of isn't one and we have seen that from bespoke evs in the last few years but it's a difficult shape to make beautiful it's a bit of a blobby silhouette the bespoke ev or has been to date not so much in this case you've got that really striking headlight design the two strikes on each side we get that front and back that's going to be an error design staple lots of very functional error going on here big intake to let that big battery breathe more on that later some more aero here to feed cool air across these enormous wheels that is that is the biggest wheel i have ever seen that be a oh 20 where is it 4 24 and felipo by the way assures me that you will be getting those on the production car that's absolutely bonkers as far as design elements all of the fussy bits are going to be kept to the bottom half of the car with a really clean swoopy shape across the top half again for aero reasons the only fussy detail that you're going to get up here is these this is the housing for the camera wing mirror and as you can see it sort of looks the dive plane that you would see on the front of a super bike superbikes have those to help them not wheelie every time you floor it i said i would imagine these are here for the same reason coming along the side i mean just take in the proportions of this thing it is so low so wide and it looks about nine meters long it's not it's about the same length as a porsche taikan so it's a big car but it looks even longer and even bigger because of that low roofline because the wheels are pushed right out into the extremities worth noting you're going to have a huge amount of cabin space in there you would think because of how far the windscreen goes forward that the steering wheel is sort of there but i'm peering in i can tell you it's here so you're going to have a huge amount of interior space to play with going to be really interesting to see how arid goes about executing that cabin how they're going to balance luxury with performance because both are big priorities of theirs and just looking at the shape of this vehicle you find me a crease find me a crease anywhere on this car you can't there are none airflow has dictated the shape of this car you can see that clearly here where the air flows across these gigantic wheels is then collected by this big fin and tucked neatly along the side of the car where it flows over the back efficiency is going to be really really key to ensuring this thing is a extremely fast in a straight line and b does more than five miles of range given its inevitably very high performance figures remember when you double your speed you quadruple air resistance so this is really really important with a high performance electric this a couple of other very supercarry things of notes we've got double falcon doors on the air sedan as we did with the suv falcon doors for people that think scissor doors are just a little bit boring and pedestrian yeah bonkers and then just get a load of these wheels let's talk about the wheels again i'm not over them gigantic and with carbon fiber inserts there's quite a lot of carbon fiber across this car not just where you can see it but the actual structure of the vehicle is made using an awful lot of the stuff as well in order to keep weight as low as possible around the back it's sort of giving me taikan on steroids design wise potentially going to have an absolutely enormous boot because there's a lot of space back here behind the rear seats that i can see in there and just looking at this thing you can very clearly see how it's going to function aerodynamically you don't need a wind tunnel and a smoke gun to understand that you can sort of just see for yourself the way the air is going to flow over the top tuck into this little rear wing and then really clean brake across the back a few technical details for you we don't have a huge amount of them but there are a couple of really interesting little details to pick through that we do know error have explicitly said that this car is going to set new standards for aerodynamics and rolling resistance it doesn't really make sense to build a super bespoke electric high performance car if you're not going to make sure it's as slippery as possible with as low of a drag coefficient as possible because otherwise you're just wasting all of that hard work that you've done on the powertrain just by punching a hole in the air not so with the air i'm expecting this thing to cut through the air a eel covered in butter and actually something that's interesting to me looking through the pressed materials of this vehicle is error insists despite its bonkers appearance that they're not looking to break any bonkers top speed records with this vehicle there's a really interesting quote from the chief engineering officer where he goes look we don't want the fastest top speed we don't want to overpower and over battery this vehicle because that just creates unnecessary weights unnecessary cost we want to make something that feels great to drive that being said they've also mentioned that it's going to have up to 120 kilowatts of battery material around at 800 horsepower and a tri-motor setup frugal another standout feature on the amoeba battery if you'll allow me to get a little bit battery geeky for a second there state-of-the-art super lightweight battery cooling system so i've just had this explained to me and now i'm going to try and regurgitate it to you with conviction bear with me let's see how we get on here most really high performance electric vehicle batteries the cells are actually submerged in a cooling liquid which adds an awful lot of weight with amoeba's battery instead the cells are actually coated in this cooling material individually meaning you don't need all that extra liquid all that extra all that extra weight making things an awful lot lighter while maintaining really good thermal management how did i do did that sound i knew what i was talking about it's a really exciting battery i love this idea of a bespoke battery built into the vehicle built as part of the vehicle and seeing what that does for its performance for its handling as well using the battery as an asset instead of having to kind of work around it as this cumbersome obstacle for your otherwise really exciting performance vehicle price don't know but have a look at it i would suggest that anything less than six figures and i'll eat my own head fairly bonkers vehicle fairly bonkers company but we need a bit of this in the electric area we need some bedroom wall poster stuff it can't all be little golf buggies that are super efficient and go 20 miles an hour need something to get people excited about electric vehicles and that to me is what this represents very excited to find out more about this vehicle very excited to drive it in early 2026 but for the time being very curious to know what you guys think of error of this radical new take on a high performance electorate vehicle do let us know in the comments do make sure to and and if you have been thank you for watching i don't actually have anything clever to say for this piece i just want to take a moment for this have you ever seen anything this on a vehicle that is destined to be road legal and sold to human customers this is game stuff this is sci-fi stuff i've never seen a vehicle with proportions quite this error are not playing by the conventional rules i just fell over,2
Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfGMSJzuD7aCZZsMBqUlGz18,zUI2kUgt_uQ,[music] for the car fans among you you might recognize this as a very close relation to the original lotus elise and you would be totally correct it is a close relation to the original lotus elise but it is also home to the most power dense battery in the entire world and by some significant margin as well approximately 10 times more power dense so i'm going to try and explain how this is possible and how the team at nio have made this a reality the fully charged show is generating positive energy with its live events all around the world next up it's fully charged live canada the top right of the screen to get your tickets today so before we get going i think it's important to distinguish between power density and energy density now if you imagine that a battery is a swimming pool the size of the swimming pool and how much water you can get into it that's your energy density but how quickly you can fill it up and drain it that's your power density and this car with approximately 10 times the power density of anything else that's available in the world means that it can fill up that swimming pool super super quickly and it can also extract an enormous amount of power from it as well and that means that this car can charge in just 6 minutes and admittedly that is with a 350 kow charger and yes there are only 17 of those in the uk but even with 100 kow charges or 200 kw chargers it is substantially quicker than any of its competitors so how have they made this magic possible well it's down to a few things most notably the anod so in your battery you've got your anode your cathode and the electrolyte which joins them and then your external circuit that sends the electrons from one to the other a small but notable caveat here nbol aren't actually saying what the anode is made from but we can hazard to guess it's some magical mixture of niobium tungsten and some other chemical wizardry materials that have a far greater conductivity than graphite or carbon anodes that we're used to seeing making this anode a veritable five-star hotel for charged lithium ions and not only that these lithium ions can get into and out of the anode exceptionally easily a bit opening up the bfold doors to let guests in rather than asking them to climb through a small window but i digress and also an electrolyte which we don't actually know that much about that is their secret source but again it has that greater conductivity so those charge ions can swim through that electrolyte super super easily and of course there's some been some design around how those anodes are structured as well reducing that internal resistance so charged ions and electrons can flow through them with relative ease and i imagine there's also some pretty sophisticated battery management software as well because we know that the cooler the battery is the quicker it is to charge now if you've got a battery that can charge in just a mega 6 minutes or only a handful of minutes if you've got a slightly slower charger then you don't necessarily need a massive battery and that's interesting because when we talk about right sizing batteries you'd be forgiven for thinking that we're talking about small city cars having not 100 kwatt hour batteries if you were the owner of this extremely beautiful car you probably would want a substantial amount of range but if you also have the ability to charge it extremely quickly perhaps you can get away with a much smaller battery and that's what theyve chosen to do here with a 35 kw battery which is tiny when you consider that the average electric battery is around 40 to 60 kwatt hours um 35 kwatt hours that puts it in the same sort of field as your highend ia now we have wanged on about this so much but obviously we need to have right siz batteries because that reduces the amount of materials that we put into them we can spread those materials across a greater number of batteries that's exactly what they've done here it's a 35 kw battery and if it can charge so quickly why would you need a bigger one but the more interesting thing is that obviously with a smaller battery it's smaller and it's lighter and look at this car it's a sports car it's got to be agile it's a ballet dancer and chucking in a massive battery would be giving that ballet dancer an enormous ruck sack and really want to give it a bum bag right a little bit about the design so this is based on the original log lease and is actually designed by the original lotus lease designer julian thompson which he did it in partnership with design house callum and also niol now fun fact about how this came to be one of the niol employees approached julian thompson when they worked together on the lo leas and said oh we've got some really good batteries it would be really good if we could you know chuck them in the boot and do a couple of test tracks show how good these batteries can be and julian couldn't shy away from the chance to you know remedy all the things he wish he could go back on the lotus le and make that little bit better and he said i think we could do one better and actually design a brand new vehicle and that's exactly what he did and here we have it this this brand new vehicle is reimagined for a lightweight electric era there is one quite notable caveat in that this vehicle isn't necessarily going into production it is here serving as a technology demonstrator but my word it does it so well it shows what we can do when we can make batteries that much more power d and that much more capable and i hope it attracts the attention of loads of oems that are milling around here today at goodwood um but it is also such a good demonstrator with the battery talent that exists here in the uk we may not have an abundance of gigafactories but we certainly have some amazing minds pioneering this next generation of batteries which are fundamentally going to trickle down so that we can all benefit from more energy dense more power dense electric vehicles,-1
Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfGMSJzuD7aCZZsMBqUlGz18,-TNwIBETzBA,foreign [music] festival of speed 2023 we are here with alpine aka spicy renault now let's just talk about renault for a moment because there's a very exciting car coming up it's called the five you may have heard of it we all collectively fell in love with it when it was unveiled in early 2021 and finally it's on the horizon now it's been a longer wait than the second avatar movie hopefully it won't be quite as underwhelming when it does arrive but renault in the process of building 40 odd final pre-production versions of that car which they're conducting all sorts of final tests on within a few months we're going to see the real final version of the renault 5. hopefully with a price tag in the vicinity of the very very low 20 000 pounds one of the most exciting cars in recent years and one of the cars that we are most excited to get our hands on but if you think that's exciting we'll have a look at this this is the extra hot alpine version of the renault 5. it's called the a290 now a little bit about alpine if you're not familiar these guys are obsessed with lightweight tactile drivers cars and in recent years they've only built one model that one it's called the a110 it's fantastic lightweight two-seater compact driver's car a little bit niche because it's a little bit expensive and forget about getting any luggage in there save for a single pant so with this new model alpine wants to go a little bit more mainstream they want to build a car that's a little bit more practical a little bit more accessible and of course electric their very first ev so what's it all about [music] well this being a beta prototype there's a fair few things on this card that will certainly not make it to production see for example the three-seater interior with the driver seated in the middle very cool never gonna happen the blue specked carbon fiber trim again huge fan i can probably imagine that being replaced with plastic when we come to production in order to keep this thing affordable but a few key touches that i do anticipate will make it to production we've got the four lamps across the front that's an alpine staple iconic feature of all of their cars i love the two indents just in front of the rear wheel which for me is definitely a nod to the mad old renault 5 turbo take a look at that functional aero piece in the rear seat pillar a bit you get on a nero ev oh spicy and just get a look on these boxy flared arches it's got more than a whiff of group b rally car to it this thing fantastic better design even once watered down into production spec i can see this being one of the most eye-catching cars on the road it's got a great base starting point in the renault 5 when you make that wider and lower and meaner the result is inevitably going to be quite a good looking car what about mechanical stuff what do we know so far well this concept is dual motor we don't know just yet if that's going to be the case for the performance car i'm sort of hoping for a single front motor setup the renault 5 conventional hot hatches that makes the most sense to me we're going to have two different power options one in the low 200s of horsepower and a second more powerful version likely in the high 200s alpine stressed that both are going to be plenty quick but without being over the top these guys really aren't into savage acceleration they're much more into tactility driving feel to that end we've got multi-link rear suspension that's the really really really fancy stuff that allows the wheels not to move just up and down but in all sorts of directions for incredible body control it's not going to be especially heavy just a shade over a ton which is relatively heavy for small old-timey hot hatch standards but for a modern ev that's pretty lightweight and that will be reflected hopefully in the handling well i've also noting that this alpine the renault 5 is going to sit on bespoke ev architecture it's called the cmfb ev platform brand new electric car platform from renault and there are advantages to that for an electric car for one weight saving it means you can kind of bake the battery into the body of the car instead of placing it onto it make it structurally integral make use of it instead of having to just add loads of extra stuff but also weight distribution typically little hot hatchbacks this are very front heavy because you've got the engine and the drivetrain all in the front something this weight much better spread again equating to lovely handling they're a bit buses these electric hot hatchbacks aren't they there's none for ages and ages and all of a sudden the floodgates have opened we've got the air bath now we've got the ionic 5n which is a bigger hot hatch but i can honestly say that this is the one that i am most excited to get my hands on the standard renault 5 one of the most hotly anticipated cars of this decade and i personally can't wait to get my hands on this spicy cousin,2
Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfGMSJzuD7aCZZsMBqUlGz18,wMMq3j8zbjk,foreign for me japan has always been the home of the latest and greatest technology growing up in the 80s and 90s everything was coming from japan from nintendo from sony it was the coolest home of technology but over the last few years we've kind of seen that sheen wear off as china has dominated technology and innovation in a very big way so right now i'm sitting here in a electric car in yokohama in japan and i'm not just sitting in any electric car this is a toyota electric car this is the c plus pod but i want to find out is this just a compliance car or is it a serious start to the game that toyota are about to begin it's only one way to find out welcome to yokohama japan and welcome to the fully charged show the fully charged show is generating positive energy with its live events all around the world next up it's fully charged live canada the top right of the screen to get your tickets today so let's turn the clock back to 1949 post-war japan now a lot of people back in that time did not have a lot of money there was not a lot of industry most people had motorbikes but in order to build an industry the government created a category of cars called k cars these small compact city run arounds with small engines k-car or kd joshua i think that's right uh these little nuggets that can drive around these small japanese cities and the focus is always on efficiency now there's only real really two companies who are electrifying take cars so far one is nissan and the other surprisingly is toyota with the c plus pod behind me and going back to that point about efficiency the japanese automakers have always been kings of efficiency whether it's their ice engines getting higher mpg or just smart solutions which everyone doesn't really think about but you think oh i could have done without that foreign now this car is not something you would call a performance monster by any stretch of the imagination so it's actually got a limited top speed of 60 kilometers an hour i think that's 36 miles an hour but for city streets this in yokohama it is perfect no cars are doing much faster than we are right now so obviously with a car this there's a lot of differences to a very kind of normal bigger sized car so first of all the car is actually made from plastic so you do hear a lot of bumps and rattles from the outside it also means that your basic facilities within the car are exactly that they're basic for example i was looking for the window open the switch earlier but there's no window it's this little clip that you pull down which is fine because it keeps the weight of the car down it gives you more efficiency it gives you ultimately more range [music] now if you look at the front of the c plus pod it's a bit awkward looking but you'll notice how narrow this car is this car is actually a hundred millimeters less than the citron army it's one two ninety millimeters wide and in fact it's it's so narrow that i'm gonna hug it because it looks it could be hugged look at that now i've obviously got quite long arms but you can hug the toyota electric car if you would now obviously not much in the way of features no radar lidar but it does have the charging here and it's only got slow charging so it takes seven hours to charge the battery on a japanese charging standard there coming around the side past all the plastic body panels again we've got these small wheels the doors are big enough for an adult to get in and out very easily egress ingress is simple with the c plus pod now the japanese are experts of packaging and i think even jack would have no problem sitting in here i've got plenty of headroom above me when i'm sat in here driving and that's what they've done they've pushed the wheels out to the edge of the car to leave the maximum space for the occupants on the inside now let's talk about practicality because let's think this is a small car this really is the only space for the boot but it does have a pretty decent boot now the good news is i can actually stand under here jack would struggle but i've got my space for my bag oh and then they've also left us charging cable in the back here and i think this is about 120 liters so perfect city car size putting a few bags of shopping or you're going out bag for the day and that's what you've got again no touch buttons just manual plastic boot all around a very practical thought well thought out car [music] so let's talk about about the c plus pod now the car comes with a gargantuan 9.06 kilowatt hour battery you think oh dear that's that's not very much but because of the efficiency of this car it weighs just 690 kilograms this gets 150 kilometers wltp the japanese standard so obviously you're going to get a little bit less than that and a less than that in the winter but that's really incredible to have squeeze out that many kilometers from such a tiny battery as part of that efficiency drive the electric motor obviously plays a big part so it's a 9.2 kilowatt motor and that delivers 12 astounding horsepower now it's rear-wheel drive so you can maybe drift it a little bit probably not i don't think it really has a proper handbrake but that delivers 56 newton meters of torque now this is limited to a top speed of 60 kilometers an hour but coming here we managed to get 63 kilometers an hour downhill uh so it does go a little bit faster but it does eat up the battery very quickly however around yokohama driving around you could easily just pop to the shops pick up your shopping go home you know you've got enough space you've got enough power and then plug it in at home it just takes a few hours on a slow charges no fast charging with this it's incredible piece of packaging that's come from toyota and they should be shouting about this car saying guys this is the direction we're going in we're going in the direction of efficiency we're going to make these panels out of recycled plastic we're going to have small motors small batteries this is the future of toyota's electrification in my opinion and i just hope they can grasp hold of this and really take it to the future and not just stop producing this after two years and say oh we've done the electric thing let's talk about hydrogen thank you weirdly though that because this is such a small car it doesn't feel bumpy or crashy or anything that the suspension feel is actually quite mature and it does feel a very comfortable ride obviously we're on exceptionally smooth japanese city streets so that does help a lot one thing i do have to complain about though is the steering feel there is none it's the loosest steering i've ever felt you can do this and nothing happens at all it's someone forgot to connect these to the wheels and it's just going in a straight line all the time very unusual feeling [music] now before i get in i just want to say that this interior skin is plastic and into exterior skin is also plastic the rim is metal but as we get in we're treated to a very basic interior but you know that is actually fine the things you do get you get air conditioning with a knob and a button you get heated seats both seats are heated and it's either scoldingly hot or off those are the only two choices you've got your reverse bpbp thing you can turn that off that's the official name you've got your rear screen heater and then your drive mode reverse neutral drive are here as well now the only odd thing is what i said earlier is this thing down here which you've got to push to get the handbrake off that's really old-fashioned just give me a electric handbrake with a button can't be that much more expensive this screen is aftermarket they've installed this for us to get around yokohama so ignore this this doesn't come with a car all you get is your range the drive mode and how many kilometers you're doing at the time again this is limited to 60 kilometers an hour but that's it and i think what toyota have done is by focusing on the important things is think about that efficiency drive if they had a screen that's going to use more power it's heavy it's technology it's going to go wrong etc etc it's going to date the car with this you could drive this in 20 years it'll probably maybe replace the battery and it's still going to be a pretty functional city run around and let's not forget about the important toyota hammer which you need to bash on the heads of the executives who are still insisting that hydrogen is the answer foreign taking this seriously there's been a lot of noise about them continuing to develop ice cars to continue to develop hydrogen cars and their hybrids you know and this is kind of the first or the second of their evs they've not really made much effort but with this it does show that toyota can do it if they put their minds to it of course this is just kind of a small experiment it's not quite a compliance card but it's not really a proper car for people to go out and buy and you know use much beyond japan this is very much a japan only car of course it would fit into streets in the uk and in europe very well i don't think people would buy this it's just are they really going to continue making the effort to develop something this maybe a little bit bigger maybe with four doors that's the question that i want toyota to answer they've shown they can do it this car is perfect proof that they can do it but can they commit to it only time will tell [applause] toyota if you are listening this is a plea from me and from everyone else you know how to make good cars you know how to focus on efficiency you even know how to make good evs and the demand is there you need to get a wiggle on and start focusing on this area because otherwise the chinese are going to come in and eat your lunch talking of lunch i'm going back to yokohama in the c plus pod see you later,2
Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfGMSJzuD7aCZZsMBqUlGz18,ETfosvPX-SU,"all right listen i'm at work but i'll speak to you later okay you hang up no you hang up no got to go robert speak later this is the new fiat grande panda and it's a small car but a big deal we've seen a lot of new electric cars from the stallan super group of late but this one it really feels is the one they're betting the house on they're going global they're launching it in 60 countries and they want it to be a massive hit they've seen the ren 5 and they want a taste of the action but is it good enough charming enough and affordable enough to be everything that they want it to be let's find out this is the new fat grande panda this is a very gray cherin and this is the fully charged show we've teamed up with duracell energy to celebrate their brilliant ecosystem of home energy products and their platinum homeowner offer by giving away a jurell bunny to win simply watch to the end and answer a question about fully charged oh here we are then friends welcome to the fiat grande panda there will be roughly 7 million new electric cars from stellantis brands in 2025 but this is the one this is the one to be paying attention to in my humble opinion for a few reasons first of all they want this to be a global success this car is launching in 60 countries this year and the plan is that this is a vehicle that works for everyone everywhere it's small it's simple it's practical it's affordable pretty cheap in the uk it's going to start at around 21,000 just under for the electric one in places france where they still have subsidies you'll be able to pick one up for less than1 19,000 euro but it's not just about being cheap and sensible i don't quoting marketing gff but in the presentation we just saw before we collected the keys the word that was used over and over and over again is felich it's italian for happiness and that is what this thing is all about being sensible practical clever affordable but doing it in a happy joyous way through great design so let's begin with a little walk around of the design let's begin with the proportions it's a boxy we thing i say we it has gone up a class was always an a segment car the panda this grande panda is a b segment still less than 4 m long so quite compact for a b segment car but it's gotten bigger and worth noting that fiat will continue to make the existing panda there will be a family of pandas they're going to release a new one every year over the next few years it starts with this the old car survives and then this i imagine will spawn an even bigger version and a smaller one and maybe a suv 4x4 type thing but this is the one we start with just under 4 m long wonderfully boxy we just pulled up alongside and original fit panda in red a moment ago in the center of trin and i kind of thought yeah that's a good translation of those design principles so we've got i mean there's so many little touches to hark back to the old car this kind of asymmetric pattern on the front that's reminiscent of that one-sided air vent that the original panda had also at the front we've got to talk about it this is this is great why did no one think of this so we have a fixed charge cable up to 7 kilowatts and it's just dead handy my first thought when i saw this is it's not going to be long enough it's not going to be long enough and you're going to have to park in certain ways to make it work but actually this maxes out if i keep yanking this is 4 and 1/2 m long it's longer than the car which means there is no way you can park this where this will not be able to reach the charger that fantastic i was wondering is it a tape measure where it kind of fires back in if you let go but it's it's a bit more relaxing that you kind of got to give it a few feel a battle rope you got to kind of wiggle it back in but i think that is really neat and tidy and there is of course there's a proper charge flap on the back that does up to 100 kw dc charging moving around the side i had to get my elbows out and fend off journalists from around the world to get my hands on this particular example because this is the entrylevel car which comes on steelies wonderful again this is all about utilitarian affordable sensible transportation so why do you need fancy rims why do you even need wheel covers just have the steelies and build a design that works with them yes love those we've got the plastic cladding of course around the wheel arches there's a kind of little skid plate type thing at the front and back and look at this we actually have the word panda kind of indented into the doors what is absolutely amazing is you can get plastic inserts that clip into those letters that sort of serve as bash guards for the side of the car how it's that fun little touches here there and everywhere this is a hologram holograph hologram thing if you look at it from this side it says fiat from this side it's just the four lines the icon of fiat fiat fiat and around the back again it's boxy it's practical i don't mind the kind of suv shape when it's applied to really small cars this not least because the panda has a history of being tall and boxy but also because in compact cars it makes sense to make them tall and square cuz it just means you get more room inside and again just more references to the original we've again got that fiat badge kind of printed into the metal i think this is fantastic stick we got this funky font for the panda badging here and in the back a really quite useful albeit big lipped boot numbers let me give you some 44 kwatt is the battery for this launch car fat reckons that's good for 320 km or about 190 m of range uh it's single motor front-wheel drive as you'd expect 113 horsepower could be zippy spoiler alert isn't and it's worth noting there may well be different versions some subsequently all-wheel drive panda 4x4 yes uh maybe more powerful ones maybe ones with bigger batteries this is the multi- energy platform that all the stellantis cars sit on so it's versatile we know that and speaking of multi- energy it is worth noting that this car will launch as an ev and a hybrid not a silly plug-in one just a regular old hybrid now with my idealistic ev evangelist hat on that's kind of disappointing disappointing it's not a pure ev and it will have a transmission tunnel etc etc but with my sensible pragmatic hat on i can kind of understand that decision because f is a global brand their sales last year were essentially 40% europe 40% south america 20% middle east and those latter two markets ees just haven't really caught on yet so if they want this to be a globally successful car a global hit which they do i think that's probably the right approach [music] now then out on the road in the new fat grande panda first impressions this thing is absolutely purpose-built for exactly the kind of roads that we're on today narrow winding uneven city streets this thing eats them up that's what the panda was all about super light controls you could steer it with two fingers super squashy suspension really quite comfortable over these nasty bumpy cobbled chein streets that was a bump of course these days i associate softly sprung cars with outrageous rolling through corners but that's only because most cars are so huge and heavy these days this is no featherweight it's a ton and a half but that feels quite dinky by modern standards and as such we have this lovely combination of being really comfortable and squashy but without feeling it's going to tip over through corners i mean there's rooll okay there's quite a lot of rle but yeah it's all part of the character and the simplicity of the driving experience i mean there is nothing here but a steering wheel and two pedals i can't put it in sport mode or range mode i can't adjust the weight of my steering or the firmness of my suspension of course not there's really just one thing i can press this little c button and then i get regen braking not quite as strong as i'd it doesn't doesn't bring this car to a complete stop but it's there if i turn it off there is less and that's it one thing that is quite remarkable about this car is the accelerator because it's the laziest throttle pedal i have ever pressed in my life it's not that slow of a car it'll do not to 60 in you know 11 seconds it's normal leisurely city car speed but the first 34s of the throttle pedal almost nothing happens i'm going to slow right down now and i'm going to press the pedal 50% nothing happens let's do it again around this corner so slow right down slow right down slow right down i'm going to floor it and there it is now this is an electric car that's by design if they wanted to that it could go whoosh and give you all the power at once but the choice has been made to give this thing a really laid-back feel discourage you from doing anything too sporty i quite that feel kind of a celebrity driving a new panda in chin today i think i saw one person applaud as we drove past happy car okay interior of the fat grande panda this this makes me happy this is a master class in doing something that is sensible practical and affordable but then keeping it cheerful through design through materials colors shapes look at this this is a happy interesting little cabin in spite of the fact that pretty much everything is plastic where do we start well let's start with the dash which has to quote the press literature an embarrassment of storage you will you will feel sheepish about how much room for your stuff you've got here we've got this little shelf indented into the dash just the old panda we've got a glove box but then we have this extra little storage box here in this funky cylindrical dash piece i love that and it's got a cool fabric pattern in the uh upgraded trim this has got a kind of bamboo fabric because bamboo panda get it same thing with the seats they're just cloth seats there's nothing remarkable about them but they look fantastic they're interesting colors we've got a kind of blue on bl blue with this contrast green stitching we've got the letters of the word panda kind of embossed into the seats that is absolutely lovely and nice seats as well they hug you quite nicely a little bit sporty and well if this was the uh higher trim level we'd have a wireless charger there we'd have reversing cameras i don't have those i don't miss those to be honest i think what i'm really impressed with in the front here is the space because look at this look at this very tall 6'5 loads of room that is the great thing about the boxiness of this vehicle f it says that this is a five seater that you can get five adults in here uh we'll follow up on that in a moment when we get to the back seats but let's just say for now i've got lots of room in the front okay h back seat jack test when the floor mats are this big you know it's going to be a bit of a squeeze but here we go now i did bring this seat forward very slightly to a position that i could just about still drive because i did stand a chance otherwise and oh actually that's a lot better than i thought it was going to be it didn't look very promising thankfully i can tuck my feet right underneath the seat in front my knees are pretty high as you can see headr room okay it's not completely miserable i could do short journeys back here that's better than i thought it would be again the boxy shape is the savior here this is nowhere near as good as the hyundai insta and a thousand times better than the rena 5 in terms of back seat [music] space i'll tell you what this thing is just as the marketing literature described this is a happy little car i was a bit stressed today the weather's not playing ball we have so little time to film this really significant car i was just a bit frazzled and then i got in this went for a drive and i just felt better so many brands want you to forget that cheap and cheerful is a thing they want you to think you have to choose between cheap or nice and you don't this is proof just the renault 5 that great design can elevate a relatively affordable sensible practical object into something more something special really only the dacher spring undercuts this thing in a way it kind of splits the difference between that datcher which is properly cheap as chips and the reno 5 which is cheapish and delightful it's somewhere between the two a real sweet spot i think it's not perfect i won't pretend it is the throttle pedal is hilariously lazy it's mad how far you have to press it for anything at all to happen this is quite a big blind spot impressively so in such a small car there's a couple of other slight niggles that bother me with all the stellantis cars but when the overall product is such a lovely one it's very easy to forgive i need to spend a little bit more time with it before declaring it the best thing since sliced bread but i have really enjoyed my first impressions with this car and i hope that this will be another renault 5 moment another car that further brings down the entry point for getting into not just a good and useful electric car but a really lovable interesting one so there we go a speedy first drive with the new fat grande panda small happy cars they're so back make sure to and

Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfGMSJzuD7aCZZsMBqUlGz18,BT_LmJUCxi0,"today we've come to the alps to participate in what is very possibly the world's slowest motorsport and to find out if an electric car can hold its own in a petrol car race this is citron 2cv ice racing it's mental [music] [music] we've teamed up with jurell energy to celebrate their brilliant ecosystem of home energy products and their platinum homeowner offer by giving away a jurell bunny to win simply watch to the end and answer a question about fully charged now then a little context on this weird wacky event and what on earth we're doing here this annual gathering of old french cars is run by 2cv and mahari club cassie the people behind the burton sports car you may have seen on the recently we're here to compete using one of their electrified 2 cvs to see how ev compares to ice in alpine conditions and more to the point to see how the diard 2cv folk feel about electric retrofits there is just one teeny tiny problem which is that this this is the electric 2cv that we've driven here from the uk to participate in the race in and it's broken really broken nothing wrong with the electrical systems it's just that yesterday some french bankers came and had a go and drove it into the back of the safety car i said banker so that leaves us with two options option one and we did consider this we just go out in one of the petrol cars lie about it in the edits uh but we decided against that not because it's morally reprehensible it would just be a lot of work so instead we're going out in this this is the burton ev prototype a one-of a-kind prototype of an upcoming car chances are as you watch this we've already posted a about that car a few days prior if we haven't posted a about that already it means i'm about to crash [music] it realized i should probably explain the rules of this event to the extent that there are any as you may have detected this is not proper racing we're not qualifying and then going wheel tohe for position this is a regularity rally that means you set a time and then you try and get as close to that time that you've set over subsequent laps i would guess that roughly 10% of participants are actually trying to do that everyone else is sort of just trying to get as sideways as they possibly [music] can right nice lap in the one of a kind the prototype who signed off on this side oh okay okay i see right so that wants to slide immediately what became very clear very quickly was that this early prototype with its unfinished and slightly shunky all-wheel drive system was pretty much undrivable on ice add that to the pressure of knowing that it's one of a mind and that our trip would be over if i stuck it into a wall and it's fair to say my presenting abilities took a hit come on come on wo right so what's become clear there is talking and driving not really achievable not in that thing anyway why are they letting me out in the one of a kind prototype that only has studded tires on the front i don't know but they are and it's hilarious i can't get to grips with it i spun almost every lap if you accelerate it rotates if you come off the accelerator it rotates if you break it rotates and the surface isn't equally slippery everywhere so it's pure guess work i say that some of these guys are making it look quite easy what i have noticed is how friendly it is i've been to events this before where everyone's taking it very seriously and this is not that there are points for best fancy dress at this event it is the happiest and least serious i motor race i've ever been part [music] of now we could show you another montage of me trying not to crash the button here but the truth is it was a bit of a non-starter thanks a lot french bankers anyway here's something much more interesting a chat with the brilliant man behind this event on the importance of electrification and the beauty of small light cars okay now this event is about fun and just 2 cvs and or maries and things that but around 2 cvs and what it shows is that the 2 cv can go everywhere you know they can go in the sand they can go in the snow in the ice and you you can have fun with a very low budget also because also it's a part of the two c car which is very affordable so uh it explains all this but more more important is that uh everyone here wants to be together to share the passion so it's a also a gathering a community which is coming here to have fun once a year this is the sixth time we organize this and you know year after year it's getting better and better so first of all what we do with electrification is of course it's about environments uh because this solution of electrifying a petrol engine to electric can be applied to any other cars but what we do here also is to uh be sure that those cars will be on the road for the next generation because we are talking to the son and grandson of our owners actual customers so that's what we are looking for with electrification and we are bringing those electric car here first as a test because you know it's rough condition for a battery because very low temperature so for us it's a way of testing the uh efficiency uh of our battery pack but also it's also preparing the future because we know that one day uh those kind of circuit they will go to electric because of environmental issues so uh one day if we want to still have this event maybe it will be full electric so we're also working on some solution about that you know an english guy say want light is right and i think for electric cars it's very important and uh for electric 2cv shows that we have a light very light car uh very efficient on the snow because you can you don't have much power but still the car you have the motricity to get out of the the curb so i think it's a real demonstration what i believe around you know about electric cars is that it's very good for urban use and we should have small electric car light to be used as a day car for going to work and things that but when i see big cars with huge battery pack uh weighting more than two 2,000 kilos i think it's uh it's a nonsense in the end because you put more and more battery inside so more weight so it's a never- ending story so here yes it's a kind of demonstration that uh there is a way in a small electric efficient car so what have we learned from this wonderfully wacky motor race well i think a couple of things for one i take great comfort in knowing that 50 odd years from now if when we run out of petrol or it's banned absolutely or the alps become a ules zone these guys will still be here going sideways in their citron 2 cvs thanks to ev retro fitting i love knowing that this will never stop happening because of electric power but perhaps more importantly i've just been reminded this weekend of the beauty of small light simple cars how capable they can be if these guyss can do this in citron 2cvs maybe you don't need a range rover for that one snowy weekend in north london i just want to see more cars built around these principles okay maybe not with the crash safety of a tin of baked beans but just small light simple stuff we need more of it that's the loud boys coming by so uh i'll wrap this up do make sure to and and if you have been thank you for watching we're really excited to

Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfGMSJzuD7aCZZsMBqUlGz18,hajp1FLvzjA,"right no time for silly intro gags today kids because this is the new kia ev4 and there is an awful lot to talk about in not very much time what is it well you can think of it as a low slung alternative to the ev3 crossover but what kia wants you to think of it as what they want it to become is the golf for the electric age you remember how in its heyday the golf was just the car it was the go-to car for anyone that just wanted some car an allrounder a ver vertile do anything vehicle that is what kia envisages i think for this new ev4 which makes it all the more bunkers that it's one of three all new electric vehicles that they have unveiled just today at this event in barcelona we've also seen the new pv5 van whole on that coming separately and there's a little ev2 concept which will give you a little peek at at the end of this so stay tuned oh oh i'm just hearing that actually in the time it's taken us to do this intro kia has vailed another five new electric cars two suvs a sports car one with legs instead of yes time sorry uh jurus salad we've teamed up with jurell energy to celebrate their brilliant ecosystem of home energy products and their platinum homeowner offer by giving away a jurl bunny to win simply watch to the end and answer a question about fully [music] charged now first thing i want to do at the top of the is just refresh everyone's memories on what my personal opinions are on the kia ev3 which this is very very closely related to i think it is the best in class i think if you're looking for a practical electric family hauler there is no better on sale right now i'm a huge fan of that car so this thing which is basically a non suv version should be catnip for me and incidentally fair play tequa for continuing to bother making hatchbacks and saloons this is available as both and not just suvs interesting strategy that k are employing in terms of how to attack electric versus petrol basically they've just decided to flood both markets in all segments so whatever size or shape of car you want whatever fuel type you want they will have a car for you bmw are doing something quite similar but the difference is that most of the electric ke are bespoke evs and not just the petrol car with some batteries in it and just quickly on this interesting to note that kia are flooding the market with new models at a time when almost every other brand is really tightening their belt straps and thinning out their model line that to me speaks to a brand that is doing quite well at the moment having said that my honest first impression of this thing is it's it's uh it's kind of ugly kind of weird looking i think i sort of looked at in the photos and thought that looks pretty weird maybe it'll be better in the metal and i'm not i'm not sure that it is that's a a lot going on there's certain angles look at the shape of that bonnet section there look how many different lines and creases there are just in this one section at the front look at the way that rear window ends and then goes into this c pillar it's from certain angles quite odd you know kia have been quite adventurous with their design language in recent years the saloon side on looks really cool it's got a lovely kind of boat tail rear deck that the one i'd have i think they're going to push the hatch especially hard in europe but you will be able to get both other thing worth noting is this thing is slippery 0.23 drag coefficient which is substantially lower than its closest sibling the ev3 and let's remember the ev3 when we tested it in korea was a easy 300 mile car with the bigger battery this with improved aerodynamics should be a genuine 350 plus electric car in the right conditions let's quick talk about the hardware breaking news it's the same as the k ev3 which means two battery options 55 or 78 kw usable uh front-wheel drive single motor not to 60 times depending on which one you go for they're in the mid sevens either way 7.4 or 7.7 seconds ample for this sort of car i don't want more acceleration than that in a nonperformance variant of an ev and of course vehicle to low vehicle to grid as standard egmp platform we know it we love it it's really good it charges quickly and it allows lots of room inside as for what has changed well the main one that i've already mentioned is the improved efficiency relative to the ev3 and it's not by the way just because it's got a smaller frontal area it's also got a cover underneath the body just to make it nice and smooth under there good for air flow and what have you so it's got a huge range and just quickly on this it's noticeable how fast brands are improving the efficiency and range of their vehicles we've been tooling around in the new facelift ed kia ev6 recently and it is significantly noticeably more efficient than its predecessor and it's just so satisfying to see how good brands are getting at extracting those extra miles out of the same size of battery instead of just adding extra battery other things that are new for this car well there's a load of software tweaks we've got i pedal 3.0 which is the latest version of kia's regen breaking it now memorizes the setting you left it on from last time which is really appreciated also works go in reverse which i think is quite fun there's a new ai powered voice command system because of course there is and it gets the latest version of kia's digital key technology which now works with apple watches good news if you're a dork cameraman andy wer apple watch that's directed at [music] him interior of the new ev4 long story short it's an ev3 in here and i'm so okay with that because i love the ev3 interior i think it's one of the best on sale right now it's one of the reasons it's one of my favorite new electric cars why well because it's just been thought about people have lived with it and tested it and made sure it actually works in the real world in your real life you've got the big easy to hit buttons and switches for the stuff that you'd want them for rarer and rarer those are becoming you've got proper buttons on the steering wheel you've got a ton of useful storage and it just looks interesting i the two-tone i the shapes of the buttons on the door and the shape of the door handle and i how even the slightly cheaper plastic elements have a real sense of solidity to them it is such a good cabin the good news is i'm doing okay for headroom in here despite this not being an suv everything else in the world i haven't suffered too much on the headroom department i've still got pretty good visibility let's see about the back right i'm going to get in quickly because looking at this rear section is making my eyes hurt um back seats yeah yeah that's good great news on the headroom front i mean i'm i'm really having to sit up straight to touch the roof at all the thing you notice when you're in a non suv ev is the floor tends to be a bit higher because of course there's a battery under there so my knees are a little bit high but this is a roomy back seats and let's remember this is a c- segment car this is golf-sized that is a very agreeable amount of space for a large adult myself ah much better i this angle let's just stay back here from here goodlooking car i the hatch i the big uh rear drls i'm not so sure about this that's not as big as a boot as the enormous cover for it suggests the lids this and then the opening is that once you get inside okay not enormous okay well that's a useful first look at the v4 let's go look at something a lot [music] prettier ooh look at this tough little fella this is the ev2 concept and it is well it's a sight for sore eyes after the slightly fussy and over complicated design of the ev4 this this is a lovely little thing and we don't normally worry too much about concept cars at charged her but the thing about recent k models is the production cars have looked almost exactly their concept ev9 perfect example and this well it kind of just looks a little tiny baby ev9 doesn't it there's a few concepted details inside which will kind of gloss over but here's what i'm actually noticing for one it's a little bit bigger than i thought it was in my head i expected ev2 to be an insta hyai insta but the kia version this is actually kind of just one siiz bigger it's a little bit more boxy and chunky it is a physically larger car and from what we're hearing early indications are it's going to be a slightly more expensive car than the insta which is in the low 20,000 this is going to be higher 20,000 i guess the ev1 when it eventually arrives will be the kind of insta equivalent another thing i expect to see make production lots of body protection lots of protruding plastic any direction that you ding this thing the first thing that's going to hit a wall is some protective plastic you know a dater spring that's good it makes it cheaper to fix and cheaper to repair those are that's a lot of wheel that's a concept car sized wheel i don't think that the production ev2 is going to be riding on 20s um but they're very nice design i' to see the kind of ones with the square inserts that find their way to production um yeah the interior is the most concepted bit i would say though i do that funky material across the dash and i the two-tone with the red accents and i the triangular bluetooth speakers mounted in the door that you can remove and take with you to the park don't think they'll be making production nor the suicide doors sadly cuz i those two and let's just finish around the back cuz i think this might actually be the best angle look at that that is a really funky little design super super wide with the brake lights they do this here just to give width to their vehicles the even v4 has the same thing but it's just a lot simpler and cleaner less creases is sometimes more and i think this is perfect evidence of that after the ev4 it's a lovely looking thing oh okay excited for this um they have it two cars for the price of one looking forward to hearing your thoughts on the ev4 was i being harsh about the design do you think maybe maybe what about the ev2 are you excited to see it in production form i certainly am make sure to and and if you have been thanks for watching we're really excited to partner

Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfGMSJzuD7aCZZsMBqUlGz18,RC_LFdpvv44,"hello we are in dorf for the unveil of what will go on to become the smallest cheapest and maybe most important electric car vw has ever made the id1 it's behind all of those german people somewhere truthfully filming at events this about on par with sticking my hand in a blender in terms of things i to do but this car in particular just too important for us to [music] miss and actually it's not just about the car it's about what the car tells us about vw plans for the next few years here's the short version bw is on a mission to get back to being the best at small cheap cars that's music to our ears so elbows at the ready let's get stuck in welcome to the fully charged show try everything electric at our exhibitions in australia canada and the uk next up london right then there is look bw id everyone concept look at that lovely little face what is this well it's the concept car for what will become bw's entry level ev their €2,000 electric vehicle and sort of the spiritual successor to the adorable vw up this is one of four new electric cars we're going to see from vw between now and 2027 this one arrives in 2027 before that we're going to get the id2 that's the €25,000 car we're going to get a crossover version of that and a spicy gti version of it this one brings up the rear and if i could just explain this car to you in terms of marvel films the point we're at now is sort of the end of gen one all the vwi id cars up to now gen 1 this is the start of gen 2 and that first generation vw got a lot of things right particularly the meb platform that all the cars sit on it's very good but they also made some choices that didn't work out quite so well the exterior and interior design of the cars they've been dropping off that platform and what we can very clearly see here is a little bit of not so subtle course correction let me show you what i mean we're really excited to partner with jisell energy to showcase their amazing renewable energy solutions if you want to reduce your energy bills and join the renewable energy transition installing home battery storage and solar panels at home is a great way to start jurell energy's ecosystem of products typically partners with solar panels but they can be just as effective without it particularly for

be able to maximize your return ready to get started you can get your quote today and don't forget we're also giving away a duracell energy bunny in every episode just answer the question about fully charged by following the link in the description good [music] luck right we need to start by talking about design i should just caveat that german man does come separately uh for me design was one of the main weak points of the id range to date they were just a bit blobby a bit forgettable and worst of all with the exception of the id buzz they didn't really look recognizably vw products this and the id2 dramatic improvements for me in all those departments it's a really well proportioned little car this and unmistakably a [music] vdub if you'll just allow me to go full vw nerd for a quick moment here that face that happy little face little bit vw up for me in fact the bumper shape front and back little bit vw up the shape of the c pillar and that straight line along the bottom of the windows very golf and actually that blacked out fascia very mark 1 golf gtr it's not a full blown pasti the reno 5 but it dips into the past it's got little touches to reconnect it with its heritage and that's good to see i that they've had some fun with it as well do you see that slightly indented roof that goes into a little mini spoiler on the back kind of fun kind of sporty and not completely just for looks as well it improves aro efficiency allegedly they call it the floating roof there is some concept stuff at play here as well it's very low and staned it's got very flared arches very big wheels and it's very wide actually for a compact economy car i wouldn't be surprised if some of those attributes lessened on its way to production but even so we got a really smart looking little car on our hands here now i want to talk to you quickly about the interior that car there doesn't actually have one because it's a model but we have seen a couple of render images and we also have this quote from the press release which i'm going to translate into english from press release speak for you listen to this with this car we're putting our customers and their wishes at the center of vehicle development more than ever here's what that means we've listened to your moaning about the annoying things about the interiors of the id cars we know we messed up the rubby haptic things are not great and it's all a bit clunky and annoying to use and we've fixed it the most noticable thing about those render images of the interior of that car is a comedically large physical volume rotary knob and comedically large physical buttons for the climate the words physical controls were in capital letters on that giant screen at one point during the presentation so this is wonderful news fair play to vw taking the feedback of journalists of customers on board and implementing it with this car we're going to see proper buttons also worth noting about that interior space bw reckons that this newly uh fiddled with front-wheel drive configuration of the meb platform allows for even more space inside that was already a huge strength of vw id car so that's super exciting in fact in the press literature they call the cabin of that car a revolutionary space giant which coincidentally is also how elon musk signs off his [music] emails right a few words on hardware and software you don't usually get this sort of specificity with a concept car but that should tell you that this well it's more than just an early concept they've really started thinking about it so what do we know well it's an all new version of the mvb platform heavily upgraded new battery new motor front-wheel drive now as well which they reckon gives you even more space inside relative to the footprints of the car teeny little thing they reckon it's as big inside as a polo and it's got over 300 l of boot space nice it's allegedly going to have a top speed of 80 mph about 95 horsepower plenty for this sort of thing and at least quote at least 155 mil of range i at least a lot more than up two which some brands love to use that's very pragmatic from that i would guess 40 45 kw battery that would be my estimation i hope you're getting the sense now everything about this car is new the design the hardware and the software this is the first car to showcase the new generation of vws infotainment and software which is developed in conjunction with rivan now just quickly a bit of broader context on this car in vw's plans for the next few years because they're saying things that are wildly different from what most of their rivals are saying specifically they're saying we want to get back into small affordable cars we want to offer lots of them petrol electric and hybrid now you make your own mind up on how you feel about the fact that they're pressing on with petrol i sort of think given how different the situation is in norway versus england versus italy versus germany i can understand but the key thing there is they're getting back into small cars if you think about a brand ford who have historically been renowned for small affordable cars and have basically turned their back on them recently because they're so difficult to make money off these days it's all the more commendable that bw are doubling down on small stuff and actually from speaking to some of the big wigs they're saying look we don't expect them turn huge profit on these things that's not what it's about it's about having an entry point into the brand it's about having a car that young people can afford so that when they grow up they keep buying vw [music] products so initial thoughts from a slightly chaotic first look at the vw id everyone first thought need a shower very hot very sticky second thought isn't it wonderful to hear a car brand in 2025 saying we're sticking with small cars because they are important and they're the only thing that most people can afford to buy new wonderfully refreshing to hear that from vw number three isn't it wonderful to see a brand listening to feedback from journalists from owners and then implementing change based on that feedback bw got so much right with their first generation of id cards but they got some stuff wrong too design wise software wise but it seems they might have addressed all of it and more with this id1 and the upcoming id2 i think these guys are in for a seriously big second half of the 2020s and my only regret is that we're not getting them sooner so there we have it the new vw id everyone soon to be the smallest and cheapest electric car that vw will sell you very exciting stuff i'm off to have a shower make sure to and and if you have been thank you for watching",2
Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfFuEGsL_PpPRqj6Tf3cwY7n,DqSt2uXnQrg,[music] every year we're being supported by new evs coming onto the market with the latest in technology and gadgets and that leaves us who want a more analog experience with something of a dilemma now we all know that it's easier to use what we already have existing and that's what some clever chaps in shanghai have done here this bike was built in 1958 and is a honda cub however this is the shanghai customs e-cub and this is fully charged [music] [music] so i've been aware of shanghai customs for a number of years now and it's the brainchild of two young expats living here in the city and what they've done is taken one of the biggest selling bikes in the world 100 million of these have been sold since 1958 and have electrified it now if you've been to a city vietnam you've seen all those gas-powered bikes buzzing around and this really answers that question of what should we do with all of those bikes we can't just throw them all away we should convert them all to electricity and that's what the guy these guys have done and it's not something that you have to send off to do you can do it yourself at home in about 15 hours so let's have a little look around this bike to see some of the features they really strip back the original honda cub here now if you know the honda cab you would have seen that they've got this big plastic thing around here to deflect all the rain now they've got rid of that and they've really stripped it completely down now in here i've got a 1.3 kilowatt hour battery and it's actually pretty small and you can take it out go off and charge it and put it back in again very comfortable seat which is great awesome led lights so these are really thin they're microscopically thin but they look fantastic and again it's all about that stripped back aesthetic now i've got my my hub down there and my brake and then coming forwards got rid of the gas tank as well they've got their own custom screen which looks really smart says shanghai customs on it tells me how many volts i've got left in the battery the time the speed the power and then i've got my basic controls on either side which is great and again at the front i've got i've got the the headlight at the front here and two indicator stalks [music] apart from being a just a really cool looking bike it's sort of a halfway house between a scooter and a motorbike it's the most popular vehicle of all time so 100 million produced it's a it's just an incredible vehicle and we thought a great platform with which not only to do cool bikes build cool customs but actually an enormous pool of old bikes that just need a bit of tlc [music] i really what they've done with this bike because it's so simple and easy and what this is to drive is also awesome so i've got a little new electric scooter which i hit use here in shanghai all the time now this feels properly chunky um handles all the bumps very well and it's actually quite maneuverable i'm you know i'm loving these big thick chunky tyres it does absorb the bumps in the road very well all in all it's a very rapid bike as well now it does have a button down here which says m if i press that that gives me boost now we a bit of boost on a bike gives you that extra speed when you need it for perhaps overtaking how easy is it to put together this kit if you're not very competent myself so we've designed this bike to be uh for anyone for the complete layman um and it can be built essentially within a day using only hand tools so there's no welding no soldering required it's called plug and play and we've made it color coordinated all the wiring yeah and number uh you know we've numbered all the wires so um it's literally just clipping it in um and putting things in the right place okay tightening it up with us with the spanner and the rest is you know off off you go pretty easy they're really incredibly easy they've actually replaced most of the components on the bikes because it's about time you know this this bike may be up to 50 years old so all the suspension has been replaced the seat's been replaced um all of these gubbins around here the wires and the the brakes all replaced so for someone competent probably not me they take about 15 hours to convert this and you're probably wondering how much this cost now if you already have your own honda e-cub frame this will cost you about two thousand eight hundred dollars for all the kit shipped to wherever you are in the world which i think is a reasonable price for electrifying uh this bike and hopefully getting it to last for the next 50 years now what shanghai customers have done is squeezed all the clever stuff below the seat now what this bike can do is a 50 kilometer range and a top speed of around 60 kilometers an hour so it's actually pretty nimble and that's all packaged in their own custom systems panasonic batteries i said before 1.3 kilowatt hours and will power you up to that top speed very quickly now we haven't tried the 0 to 60 time i don't think that's a good idea on the streets of shanghai but i can tell you now it's very rapid so who's buying the e-cub at the moment our biggest markets are california and japan unsurprisingly being the two biggest cub markets um but we're in 20 plus countries now we're in mexico cambodia uh you know all across i mean i suppose we're in germany france spain everywhere really uh and actually now we've got one in in south america it's um we're on all continents apart from antarctica wow so yeah incredible yeah that's uh we were waiting for that south american one just to tick it off and now we're yeah all continents that's really amazing antarctica is going to be a tricky glass hurdle that we maybe we can get [music] there [music] so i love projects and i love tinkering and this for me is the ideal project there haven't been many companies out there who have been able to give us a electric project at a more reasonable price and this i think answers that question but it also asks another question honda what are you doing why aren't you doing this i would love it if honda said okay new scheme take all of our old honda cub bikes convert them to electric it'd be fantastic if all of us were driving around these the streets of europe and the us now thank you very much for watching i've really enjoyed driving this around today we've got plenty more videos coming from china very soon and some very very exciting ones mostly in the south of china so if you haven't already they've got our patreon our youtube memberships our merchandise all on those lovely links around this and if you have been thank you for [music] watching [music] you,2
Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfFuEGsL_PpPRqj6Tf3cwY7n,n5xZAM246aY,"[music] hello i'm maddy and welcome fighters fully charged recently on the you might have seen that i made the switch from a petrol pumping hatchback to an electric car we've actually got the renault zoe right now this is temporary because we've got something quite exciting on order but that's another story so making the change to electric was absolutely game-changing would never go back but here's the thing for the majority of the journeys i make don't actually use the electric car no instead i use the bicycle so i live just outside of cambridge which is often known as britain's cycle city and i totally see why it's got over 80 miles of bike lanes there are lots of routes that connect the local villages and towns and let's not forget that there are about 50,000 students who will hop on the saddle to get between their lectures so the body is my preferred way of getting around the city but what i want to know is will giving my push bike an electric upgrade be worth it [applause] [music] [applause] [music] let's talk about ebikes because their popularity has soared in recent years it's actually thought that in the next three years somewhere between 125 and 130 million ebikes will sell globally which is a huge amount and would make them the best selling evs on the planet outnumbering the number of electric cars on the road so to find out what the fuss is about i'm going to take these two for a little test spin but helping will be greg yes haven't tried an e-bike before so i'm very excited no fun my ride for the day is the 2020 rally array good all rounder entry level this one so aluminium frame it's got seven gears we got front suspension which is great for evening out lumps and bumps in the roads or cobbles if you're hiking around cambridge you got a kick stand at the back you've got front and back mud guards as well ria pannier rack and you've got a front and back light powered off the battery i'm gonna be taking the flip folding a bike for a spin these are actually available for pre-order but this is one of three that are actually in the uk right now so i feel pretty special to be cycling this and what's really cool is that it was designed and made in cambridge very um it's got an aluminium frames been heat treated and the whole thing including the battery weighs 15 kilograms and you've got the front light here it got an integrated backlight and these are both powered by the battery more on that later here you've got your brakes and a control unit and tucked it in just behind the control unit you have a usb port so you can charge your phone if you want c right let's have a look at the tech of the rally array ebike the evic comes from their battery 400 watt hour battery to charge that up from completely empty to fully charged it's four to five hours batson's juice to the motor back here on the rear wheel hub and electric drive speed is 25 kilometers per hour max which is fifteen point five miles per hour range is around about 30 to 50 kilometers as 20 to 30 miles but that depends on the rider weight the terrain that you're riding over and also which level of assistance you're going for there are three levels they're all operated by this control panel up here you've got eco standard and high last thing to show you is with this key you can take off the battery so that can get locked up in the shed or whatever and this will come in to get charged inside let's talk about the fun stuff on board the flip defaulting bike and it has a rear wheel hub motor back here and that is powered by a custom 220 watt hour battery that is hidden inside the sleep frame so you can charge it using this port at the back or you can take it out by slipping out the saddle and then the battery just slide straight out of the frame and then you can take that inside and charge it whenever you want to and it should charge from nothing to full in about three hours time so the flit has the same range as the rally except it has five different assistance levels which you can hop between just using the control unit up here and then finally just all your bikes in the uk the motor will provide you in max speed of 25 kilometres an hour as with any folding bike there is going to be a knack to it and you're gonna become slicker the more you practice i've heard though that you can get this fold down to ten seconds and i'll give it a good [music] which got the first wheel round looking promising oh you've smashed it [music] okay we're gonna head into the city center and it's worth saying that we are filming this cheering lockdown so this bike ride is going to be our daily exercise we're going to limit the timing that we're out and we'll only stop very very briefly but this is actually the first time that either of us have been into the center during lockdown in about six weeks so we're actually just really looking forward to seeing it all quiet and beautiful all right ready adventure time yes hey matt standing start standing start race okay all right okay ready come on high mode you're in high good two one i'd usually find quite tricky which involves going over bridge it's very steep so i'm excited see for the electric by makes different [music] this is the bridge that can sometimes be difficult so we're going using assistance might bite okay this is revolutionary honestly this this bridge is manageable but typically it can be a bit of a struggle especially on an early morning okay we're approaching kings right now is on our left [music] [music] [music] we've got a family friend in the lake district which is very hilly and apparently she would not normally go out on a you know standard push bike but she's got an electric bike and she's been loving going out with assistance up the hills yeah and she's knocked it down from you know level three this is level two assistance actually gets better yeah which looks a gateway i guess towards eventually maybe doing a normal push bike which is really interesting because halfords reported there in the uk sixty-five percent of their electric bike sales are going to over 55 so i think we're seeing these a way of getting people back into cycling which is pretty cool and getting assistance where they need it yeah but what i think is really exciting is how it sort of the roller bikes might play in commuting in the future because i think for a lot of people who might have to commute that sort of four five-mile ish distance a push bike is it they're just not interested it's a little bit too tricky a bit too far and they will favor a car however an e-bike suddenly makes that distance much easier and i think for people who might not be able to afford or make the investment in an electric car i think an e bike is a really good alternative cool exciting shall we carry on yes just the us or by clicking on flickr and i love it i love it as a fold away bike i think it would be community especially if you to and from the station and then you wait to go somewhere else and take it to work to work and if it's the most comfortable bike no it doesn't you know how the big comfy saddle or you know the the large wheels that are likes at the rally does but i don't really think that's the point and we've been taking on a cycle around cambridge now and it's not handling their cobbles all that well but i don't really think it's supposed to and if you were looking for an electric bike help you with your commute then i'd recommend it all right we're back at base what i want to know is what do you think of e bikes generally and do you want one what do i think of them a lot of fun that was today that edit oomph is great yeah do i want one yeah love one i actually spend that much money on one right now i don't think so because the way that i use the push bike that i have i don't think i need that extra assistance it'd be helpful but i don't need it and if i was in the lake district and i wanted to go on some great adventures regularly longer than i we're doing a push bike i'll be really great to have one yeah we've both ridden both of the bikes and it's it's unfair to compare them because they have different purposes the flip would be fantastic if you were commuting and perhaps you had to go on a train and then you had a journey beyond that and then the rally is way better if you go on long bike rides and you just want something a bit more comfortable yeah good to see the hydraulic disc brakes good suspension that flitt level five of that assistance yeah it feels nippy which is really fun it's a fun ride and do i need one i'm in a similar position to you i probably don't need one do i want one yes and however i think that if i was in a place where i had to regularly travel a little bit further than i would comfortably do on a traditional bike and i didn't have an electric car would 100% get any bike interesting and i can totally see why there'd be a really lovely thing for lots people to have yeah definitely so with that in mind that is it from us if you have been thanks for watching and we'll see you soon until you charged [music] [music]",2
Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfFuEGsL_PpPRqj6Tf3cwY7n,qo6i5VcJ-ME,this is a bicycle and this is a big box with the word switch written on it so this is the switch that's a bicycle and this is fully charged so a couple of things to explain now i've had this bike for um about seven years it's not a really high-end racing bike or something that but it is very very light it has amazing disc brakes that are really extraordinarily better than the old caliper brakes is the first bike i had with disc brakes i grew up with derailleur gears where you had to pull a levering one you're right you would never sure if you were actually in gear this just goes tick tick tick absolutely perfect each time so that is really good so this is the hill this hill is my nemesis this is salters lane now when we first moved out here 30 years ago i used to cycle here regularly i used to go up that hill i would get puffed but i could do it now i can't in fact that's why i've come to this point because it was around about here somewhere that as i was trying to get up a couple of years ago i just collapsed on on the on the grassy bank at the side of the lane i was in tears i couldn't breathe that and a neighbor of course had to drive past at that moment they thought i'd have a heart attack and they were worried for me i said no it's fine so i had to get off and walk get up there so what i'm going to do now is convert my existing pedal cycle to an electric pedal assist bike now the wonderful people from switch bikes have told me we're going to meet them later on in this episode they have told me that i will be capable of converting my bike to an electric bike and i'm hoping they're right because i have been known to things up in the past but i'm really going to give it a go so that means i will be able to come here again and see if i can cycle up salter's lane my nemesis salt was laying watch out i'm coming for you [music] okay so this is the first time i've done unboxing i'm fully charged back to the first time i've ever recorded an unboxing situation i don't really know to be honest what is in here this is oh okay now i do well there's clearly a wheel puncture-proof tires that has got to be the battery pack and a charger plug oh look that's a universal pedal sensor oh that is very very special okay i better get on with the conversion [music] okay so i'm now joined by oliver and dimitro from switch bikes hello hi guys it's great to be here so good to see you i have had such a brilliant time with my old bike now it's a new bike it's a totally dif i don't even think of it as my old bike it's my new bike it's really really cool so i went through you were very very helpful in in helping me convert it but i went through the whole process and the only bit that was a bit fiddly was the the pedal sensor everything else was really straightforward it really was anyone could do that that was a bit more of a faff but i mean you know if i can do it that means ninety percent of the population can do it don't be sit down with yourself well yeah and once it's fitted once it's done it's done you just forget about it and just it works so easily it is really really impressive [music] this is the the hill that that got me that broke my cycling spirit a few years ago bro's getting twain yeah it is it did because this is so this is called salter's lane and it's a lane that goes from the what is the vale of eveshum up to the top of the cotswold escarpment and it's actually one of the gentler hills because some of the other hills are some of them are not as steep as this but they're really busy roads so you don't really want to cycle on those this one is very quiet but it just goes on and i just couldn't make it and i think it's you've got to put it down to age and it'll be easy for you guys robert you're not a year older than 30 surely i'm 30 well over 31 but uh but this makes it possible you know i could not have got up this hill without my my switch adaption on this bike and i've that's the really good thing about this system is i i know that i've got try to get up on this bike so it's not even a different bike it's the same bike the bike remembers the bike remembers the poor old get can't get up the hill i mean i just think it's such a sensible obvious idea of of being of making it possible to convert existing bikes and clearly hit any bike so well we did bring a few toys today to show just how uh you can fit really any bike yeah i mean you're right it seems obvious once you know that you can turn any bike now into an electric bike um and yeah we're just trying to get the message out there that everyone with a bike at home who maybe aren't riding it as much as they want to be maybe they're driving uh petrol or diesel cars and they should be out on their bikes [music] so what you're sending out then is those box boxes i got yeah with and that will have a wheel that's the right size so if say you have a brompton and you want to buy us get an electric conversion you'll get a new brompton wheel so we uh we're out of stock at the moment due to high demand most of the bicycle industry but we normally stock uh common wheel sizes that you can buy right now for 999 999 pounds or very popular at the moment is we're offering the opportunity to pre-order and the way that works is quite useful for the wheel size so we take we take orders and then you confirm after you order your wheel size and any other specs we build it to order to match your bike and yeah the box arrives it's perfectly tailored for your bike pop it on right and off you go and so that is i know the question that our viewers are gonna because they i know that there's gonna be a lot of people watching this going i want that one i want that on my bike so it's how much it cost then to do it you mentioned there the cost of it but at the moment what's that what are the alternatives it's basically about 500 pounds to pre-order one right and you have to wait 10 to 12 weeks whilst we manufacture it for delivery to your door and alternatively we will have some stock soon and the retail price is about is double that so 999 pounds the actual capacity of the motor is what you did tell me is it two 250 motor which is the highest you can have in the uk and most of europe right i mean that is a beefy mountain bike but that so the motorcycle isn't sexy the same as the as the one on here it isn't yeah yeah just a different color right so that's another thing we uh we offer two colors silver and black because some people have got kind of quite sexy bikes this and they want it to emerge and then the actual battery i don't know it's going to say how many kilowatt hours of the battery there's no two five 0.25 hours yeah but it sounds better if you say 250 watts 250 watts and actually uh so that's a coincidence but 250 watts and 250 watt hours are not the same thing yeah but you know it's a good the numbers are the same which means that at maximum power it will last for an hour right yes yeah so uh but normally normal use you would use it at medium power yeah we to encourage people to use their legs a bit too very important so at medium power and medium leg power you should get two hours of run time right and then you know and that will take you about 40 or 50 kilometers right yeah yes and that is but what is also very revealing is how efficient bicycles are because if you think 0.25 of a kilowatt hour oh yeah we can get along with a bit of a human help a long way 0.25 of a kilowatt hour in the most efficient electric car will take you 500 meters and the sustainability co2 emissions are just what you breathe out so if i go down a gear because it feels i'm peddling much faster than you but that means when if i the faster i pedal the more the pedal sensor yeah that's right it's a big movement it's sensitive to the cadence so if you give it a bit more cadence it will give you a bit more power yeah so yeah especially when going up a hill if you're in a nice low gear and keep the pedals turning you can let the motor do a lot of the work right yeah yeah and roughly speaking the average man's leg power is about 250 watts right which is sim which is the same as the motor power i see so you kind of double the power right so i reckon you could probably put out four or 500 watts when you really go for it right so adding this 250 watts on the front wheel you've got you know 250 watts on the back without really having to kill yourself crazy yeah and then 250 watts on the front and now you know you've got the power of a professional road cyclist almost a very out of condition overweight one yeah yeah you might still want to put some lycra on to reduce the air resistance yeah yeah yeah i should have been in my very very revealing lycra we tried to keep it really simple yeah it's the bare minimum that you need to make an electric bike work and for most people this is plenty of features absolutely right but then so there are other uh connectors underneath this one that's right is that so you could have other additional bits on it is that yes so there's so many different accessories most common one is probably a throttle or a brake sensor and that kind of gives you a little bit extra control especially going up the hills or kind of starting off the off the traffic light and what is it i don't understand because i understand the throttle what does the brake sensor do is that if you put the brakes on it cuts the power to the yeah when you pedal the power goes when you stop pedaling the power stops but if you want extra control eg if you're commuting and you're adjusting at traffic lights if you just touch the brake sensors then even if you pedal a bit the motor won't come in right but it's an optional add-on because generally speaking you know you get used to it pretty cool because the first time i rode i think because it you know i've got another electric bike which i'm used to which i don't know how to adjust that but this one the first time i got on it and i felt it pulling away it was more alarming because it was a bike i'm used to that didn't used to do that suddenly it does start helping you which is quite a different experience and yeah you'll get used to the electric power so then when you turn it off yeah suddenly it feels oh crikey i'm going to use your legs yes yes yeah indeed it's getting steeper up here now quite often there are cows in this field and once when i was coming up here i thought i could make it there was a cow lying down on the road and i didn't feel i should make it get up so that that stymied me yeah well the other great thing about uh converting it on the front wheel is now your two-wheel drive yes that's the key because i'm i'm doing the rear wheel yeah you're doing the rear wheel never made to do the front wheel so the thing i about it though is you get to work it you live in a city get to work lock your bike up you do this i've got to try and get this right this time yeah yes the one-handed release walk up to your office plug that in but then how long does that take so say you pre it's pretty low you've got one bar left yep how do you how long does it take to check well you're this it charges at 10 miles an hour or 15 roughly 15 kilometers an hour wow that is really good you've got 50 kilometers range it's just over three hours right and that's just on an ordinary domestic socket regular socket yeah charge it anywhere that has a as a plug point oh we're almost there i can we're i can almost see the uh the end is in sight yeah the light what's the equivalent for the light at the end of the tunnel the crest the crest of the hill the crest of the hill there's no way i could have done this without my switch there's no way i'm at the top of soldiers hill i could not get up that hill without having electric motor on this bike it's been really good as you can tell it's made a huge difference to an old man on a bike i'm really proud i made it up this far uh fully charged look at the patreon link because i might need serious medical help uh have a look at the youtube memberships as always if you have been thank you for watching you,2
Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfFuEGsL_PpPRqj6Tf3cwY7n,SEIrM7YvXSE,[music] do [music] um i'm a very keen cyclist i do cycle almost everywhere and in lockdown i've been doing a bit more a couple of weeks ago i was cycling along the south coast of england i was coming out of lime regis if you know that road it is horribly steep i was on a bike with panniers i was not doing that so i was close to the top of this hill walking struggling with my bike up this steep hill and i heard a cyclist just coming up behind me and i was fair play to them he can cycle up this hill or she and i can't uh and i turned around to look at the cyclist and it was just it wasn't one of the lycra clad brigade it was just some regular guy on the bike and he saw me looking and as he overtook me peddling up this really steep hill he called out at me the future is here and that was when i saw the battery pack on his frame so the question is was he right there is a quiet revolution going on on the streets of britain the e-bikes are coming and this that's what this episode is going to be all about what you know a little bit about electric bikes who's using them what's going on my companion on that journey is going to be this bike here which is a van moff s3 it's one of the newest bikes on the road and one of the most distinctive so was that guy on the hill right our e-bikes the future or are they just hype welcome to fully charged the first chain driven bicycle was invented in 1885 and they haven't changed that much since then you know the materials have gotten better the manufacturing's got better but the concept of the bike is basically the same it just works it's an astonishingly efficient form of transport about 99 of the power from your legs goes into moving you along the road they really do work and there are more than this is a frightening number a billion bicycles thought currently to be in existence they far outnumber cars so the e-bikes might be the next big step for the humble bicycle but what is an e-bike let's start with the law in the uk um they have to be pedal assisted so they will help you only when you're pedaling up to 15.5 miles an hour and after that you can go faster but you're on your own they you have to be more than 14 to ride one all the normal laws of the road apply the maximum power of the motor is 250 watts and as long as all of those things are satisfied then that's your e-bike one of the things that's been really obvious during lockdown and i think it's great is that the cyclists have been out in force the numbers of people i see cycling have really increased and i'm definitely noticing a lot more e-bikes on the roads ridden by a huge variety of people and the statistics on bike sales during the past few months have been astonishing you know ebike sales were going up 50 a year anyway but during lockdown people clearly saw they didn't want to use public transport they wanted the freedom and bikes are the obvious solution now e-bikes are not necessarily the cheapest first option you you know they the price varies a lot between maybe a thousand pounds and three thousand pounds that's maybe the middle range for e-bikes and those are good bikes in that range they're made by all sorts of companies the traditional company manufacturers are in there there are lots of startups generating e-bikes there's lots of interest but here's the thing that i think has really changed in the past couple of years if you go back uh looking at you know articles in cycling magazines and tech magazines from two years ago they assume that the people who are going to be riding e-bikes who are going to be buying them are basically tech obsessed blokes but if you look at who's actually buying them now and the demographics people are looking at those manufacturers are looking at now they're just people ordinary commuters who would to get to work don't want to arrive sweaty don't want the lycra they don't want all the fuss they don't feel they're joining a club they just want to get to work and that is the game changer when this becomes something that is just another tool another mode of transport for everyone that's when you're really looking at scaling things up so this is the bike the van moff s3 it's only been on the market since may 2020 so it's very new it's got a look this bike it everything is integrated into the frame so there's electronics up here the batteries down there you can't take any of it out can't take the battery out to charge it so you have to plug the whole bike in all of that happens just underneath here so there's um sockets and a reset button all that kind of stuff one of its swanky features one of the many is this what they call the matrix display on the top here so um when you switch it on or when it talks to your phone there's a little pixelated display that's actually part of the tube which is quite nice it has motor on the front here so it's just front wheel drive it is 250 watts so it's the maximum power allowed in this country disc brakes hydraulic brakes as well so all of that is into the frame here there are little cables up here and uh the chain it's got it's got a normal chain but it's hidden inside something here so there's none of that getting oil down your legs it's not a light bike you might not think it was an electric bike to look at it perhaps but as soon as you pick it up 19 kilos it weighs a lot as far as the elect the power goes it's got four gears it switches between them automatically obviously and you can choose the level of assist so you can go from zero where you have to pedal all of that 19 kilos for yourself up to level four when you get quite a lot of a boost so of course it connects directly to an app from the app you can adjust the levels at which the gears change you can lock the bike and the bike's actually got an electric locking system built in so even if you don't have a separate lock um it will lock up down there and and that's it and they also have an extra service van mode which they where they promise that they call them the bike hunters so if somebody does pick this thing up and walk off with it they promise that they'll either find it within two weeks using the tracking on the bike or they'll give you a brand new bike which is not bad so they've thought quite a lot about the security aspects of it it does have one quite nice feature which is a remote servicing thing so all the electronics in here slides out so you can send them away to be serviced without having to send the whole bike so a normal bike shop would be able to deal with you know the wheels for example because they're pretty much the same but the specialized electronics they have actually thought about that so you can you can get that sent off separately and then the app that it connects to you know everything connects to a phone these days this one you don't need it to ride the bike you can adjust all the settings and mess with everything lots of cyclists me use strava or endemodo lots of apps anyway so if you're using an app to work out where you are to navigate then why not have an app to control your bike as well so it does all fit in so that is all the tech i think so it might be time to take it for a ride [music] the tech on this bike is really slick you do it's a kind of i feel it's a bit of a marmite bike you've got to either buy into the look of it or it's not for you and one of the things that goes with that is that you you're stuck or you have the choice of um their way of doing things so there's nothing you can add or adjust you can't change the forks you can't change the brakes this is the bike this is what you're getting now that is great if you the look and you're in for that and there are a couple of problems i think with it but the biggest one the biggest butt starts with your butt there is a considerable natural variety in the anatomy of the human bottom and it's particularly it is different for males and females but that difference perhaps doesn't exist in the van moof universe this one i have to say is it's not a comfortable saddle for me women do need saddles that are different from those that are suited to men and it really is a health issue you know it does cause a sort of problems you probably don't want to talk about it dinner parties if you get it wrong so i think that's a real problem with the look of the bike um and there's a few other things you know for a pannier rack you've got to use their pannier rack you've got to choose to have the attachments for that when you first buy the bike so there's a lot of that kind of thing you know if you love their components and you love their way the bike looks that is great if there's things you don't love the saddle if you're a woman tough [applause] however the tech is the tech is still [music] lovely [music] so here we are i am at box hill in surrey it's about 20 kilometers from where we were before and that took about 20 of the battery on this thing so i'm actually quite impressed with that that suggests that in reasonably easy cycling conditions with the full electro assist on it might have a range of about 100 kilometers that's pretty decent i'm genuinely impressed with the battery longevity so the reason that we are here is that this is a famous bit of road um there aren't many big hill climbs in the south of england but this is one that became very well known because it was part of the cycling road race in the 2012 olympics and it's one of the most popular strava sections in europe the climb is 129 metres over 2.5 kilometers and to be honest in the tour de france they wouldn't even notice that but in the surrey hills here in the south of england it's a very popular route and you know it's a reasonably big hill so i have done this on my own road bike before i definitely find it challenging and now i've got an e-bike to see if we see if it gets any easier so this is the test in the in the past bits i was cycling in environments that i found very straightforward as a normal cyclist i find this challenging let's see whether this van moff makes this a really pleasant experience or it's still a bit of a trek here we go so you might think that bike this would have regen braking and it doesn't for two reasons one of them is that when you cycle most of the work you're doing is against air resistance so you're not getting any of that energy back and the other one is the type of motor you need a different type of drive to be able to run it both forwards and backwards and most the most efficient motor for everything else doesn't work for that but then you don't really need it so it's fine [music] well frankly that was ridiculous i'm not even out of breath i should have taken my pulse at the bottom because it was just any other bit of road just cruised up it and i'm genuinely astonished at how easy the motor made it it was quiet i barely knew it was going i wouldn't have known that i was getting any assistance at all ignorance is bliss that i think yeah so um it does feel a bit cheating but this bike on that hill is not for me this bike on that hill is for the people who are a bit worried about cycling normally who can't keep up with their family or their friends who just not that confident and suddenly they have access to this fabulous view and that is only a good thing so what do i think about this bike it's a bit of a mixed bag i'll be honest with you i think that the the motor is brilliant it works on those hills it's really quiet it adds the power and you don't even notice that part of it is great there's all these nice little techy bits that are kind of geeky this screen on the top can't really see it in sunlight but it's really nice to be able to see your speed it shows you the speed as you're rolling so i that um it makes a lot of funny noises it really does make some funny noises you can turn them off the battery life is genuinely impressive i didn't expect it to be able to travel for that long without a charge and to charge the whole thing takes four hours so that's pretty good i think on the flat it's not particularly distinctive you know if you're just going around the streets and it's a kind of you know flattest place you're just carrying along that unless you're carrying really heavy bags um the amount of money you would pay for this which is eighteen hundred pounds you know you could pay a lot less than that for a bike that would feel make make that feel just as easy however as soon as you get to the hills life is different coming up here in box hill was was so easy and that is all about opening up this to people who might not normally cycle here the potential for make helping people feel comfortable on the roads helping people enjoy cycling all of that is brilliant and you know we know with these bikes at the moment that a lot of them are bought by an older demographic um and all of those people suddenly have this freedom they can get out they can get exercise doing cycling they don't have to feel limited and i think that is brilliant i find that saddle really uncomfortable and i suspect a lot of women would so i think i would to see more female designers and cyclists involved in the improvements to this bike but in general i honestly don't know whether any of that really matters because the thing is that this is a developing technology the changes are coming really quickly the prices are coming down you know the battery power to weight ratio is going up they're becoming more available the infrastructure for them is becoming available so maybe this is one of the best e-bikes on the market now i could believe that but it can get better and it will get better and what this is really about is where this technology is going it's not about the techie toy now it's a nice bike fine i wouldn't buy one fine none of that matters the point is you can absolutely see this will help people it will get people onto the road it will get people out of their cars and the technology is just going to get better and better that's what this bike does it you know their their slogan is ride the future they make a big fuss about that and you know i think they're over hyped this a little bit but i think the point is bang on and this will change what cycling is it will make it an alternative to driving and for that you've got to give it all the stars [music] so back to the question at the start are e-bikes hype or are they the future and i think they really are a big part of the future they're not going to replace pedal cycles i love cycling i love doing all the work myself i can enjoy that hill without any electric assistance and that's all fine that is going to stay it's not a threat to any people who cycle at the moment what it is going to do is open the doors to lots of other people and um this this is not a replacement for a bike it's a replacement for a car it's just it allows people to get out it's brilliant and so this kind of ability it's brilliant more of it bring it on let's experiment with all these ways of getting around let's make the whole thing battery powered so there's no emissions you know brilliant more and on that note actually we have got another episode coming up on e-cargo bikes so bikes are not just being used to electrically carry or help electrically assist people moving around but also to assist small amounts of cargo moving around so that will be coming up on fully charged very soon and that's it for today so if you'd to support us do via patreon or by youtube membership there is loads of stuff on the fully charged show website so have a look at all of that and there's lots on e mobility on there as well so go digging around for that stuff and if you have been thank you for watching you,2
Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfFuEGsL_PpPRqj6Tf3cwY7n,fQ8HRntn8c8,[music] [music] at last robert has sent me out to look at an electric motorbike and i've come to stockholm in sweden the home of cake bikes welcome to fully charged [music] [music] [music] [music] alban that looks so much fun the power that you're generating to come out those tons it's just incredible because i know the bike's quite light the amount of power it's got so how long has kate been going so we started or we produced our first bike in early 2018 or launched our first bike in early 2018 so it's almost yeah two and a half years from now um and it's the bike you see here yeah and the bike we have been riding at the track today and now two and a half years i do have actually six month models on the market okay what was the ethos what was the motivation behind starting a company so we found out that it's it's a gap between um yeah it's a gap to fill with this bike this is just between a motor motorbike and a bicycle so we got all the e-bikes and electric motorbikes or motorcycles but this is just between so we have developed all components from scratch to support the electric drivetrain keep the weight low and fill this gap between a bicycle and motorcycle we found out pretty quick that bicycle parts are too weak and motorcycle parts are too heavy so we have reinforced everything and build it our own way to get this bike at only 69 kilo kilos actually 69 kilos so the power to weight ratio must be incredible yeah it is so then this is your of all the bikes you do this sort of flagship right this is the or so tell them about this bike yeah so it's only 69 kilos and as i said all components are developed from scratch to support the electric drivetrain uh it's direct drive uh so no transmission no gearing uh to keep us less moving parts in the engines as possible to make the or to keep the maintenance low um it's super easy to ride everyone can ride it you have adjustable ride modes from one to three which one is the easiest mode and three is the most powerful mode what would you say an equivalence of bike so i usually would say it's a 250 okay at the third gear so the top speed isn't there but the torque is definitely there and the the three giga version the calcan is equal to 125 or certified uh to a 125 cc bike okay so there are a few difference between this bike and a conventional combustion engine bike in that they there's nothing there's no there's no gears clutch no clutch there's nothing for your left foot to do nope there's no rear brake for your right foot the rear brake is where the clutch would be yeah on the lift and the front brake's still not the same place okay but that's yeah it's going to be a little bit you just get used to someone who's used to normal bikes the fact that a there's no clutch but also you get used to pretty fast yeah we did a race last year with um a really good enduro rider with constant and he first said that he wants a foot brake because we have a foot brake on the 3 giga version but then after a few more tests he said that i can i can go on the race with a left rear brake um because i it as much as the foot brake so it's just to get used to it yeah more yeah [music] right now for the best bit uh alban how to make it go yeah so this is the right modes one is for beginners it's super easy and gentle to you two is a little bit more powerful and three is full torque full extra acceleration and you reach top speed of eight kilometers per hour the braking modes one is no engine brake at all a bicycle two is a two stroke a little bit of onion break and number three it's a four strokes of full engine break okay and the braking modes two and three also really gents you get power back to the battery [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] now the caulk or is your flagship bike but it's not the only one that cake do no so now two and a half years later we have actually six bikes on the market uh we got the streetlight version of the calcowar which is the calc and the calc inc and the calc inc sl the inks are pretty much the same bike but they are black and they are a little bit heavier with another suspension not their lens and other wheels and tires uh which makes them a little bit cheaper as well uh and then we got the ursa that is more utility bike workbench on wheels yeah so it's a clamp-on system it's a big beam that you can clamp on yeah pretty much whatever you want baskets skill racks surf racks and bring what you need i the analogy of it being a workbench on two [music] wheels that was a lot of fun it's a really nimble little machinist even on a tight little circuit this but i'm going to swap this one for the road legal version and go and take a tour of stockholm [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] so all that power has come from the battery here so you know what's the lifespan of it how long it's going to charge how long it's going to last is it changeable yeah so you can change the battery in 90 seconds it's only two screws on the receipt remove the seat and then you can take out the battery so it's super easy you can ride for about three hours in one charge and it takes two and a half hours to recharge it from zero to hundred in a standard outlet to twenty or one tonne these three giga versions we would say can go about 86 86 kilometers uh and uh some models goes from 10 100 kilometers to 120 kilometers the final thing i want to talk about because i just i love this detail because it kind of shows that the the conservation mind behind these products is the tires yeah which don't look much different but there's something there's a secret behind them yeah so it's our own tires as i said everything is developed from scratch by us so this tire is actually really kind to the surface you ride on you don't rip up the trails unnecessarily much and it's it's still good traction because of the good power delivery from the controller so it's a it's called trail savers so save the trails but yeah yeah so the idea is to reduce basically erosion of the trails [music] [laughter] [music] [laughter] [music] [laughter] [music] so that was the calc and the street legal version of the off-road bike and what makes it street legal is a few things it's got things lights indicators mirrors it's got a kickstand it's got license plate at the back the big difference for me is is the speed so this bike will top out at 100 kilometers an hour 62 miles an hour and whereas the off-road bike will top out at 80 kilometers an hour at 50 miles an hour and the reason for the extra speed is it means that this bike can keep up with traffic and not be an obstacle on the highways and the motorways of europe in north america and how that's done is interesting is the same basic bike um but the rear sprocket is slightly small on this bike so you lose a bit of acceleration but you gain in top speed but crucially for those who might want to use this big commuting at weekdays and then ragging it around the forest at weekends all these road legal bits come off really easily and you can turn it into basically that bike there but for me bikes these are for getting out in the wild and exploring so i'm going to hop off this and hop onto that and take it for a ride around the scandinavian forests [music] [applause] [music] i [music] [applause] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] so [music] right so most importantly what does the cake cult to ride well in the road this beautiful spawns really well i mean it's perfect for commuting around town on the open road again up and past 60 miles an hour is not a struggle in in the third riding mode yeah admittedly it's not it does feel if you're used to big fat 1000 cc road bikes you'll feel a little bit insecure and a little bit unstable but that's just the nature of a lightweight bike this and then out here in the environment it's really built for what's it well it's massive fun and i really really it having multi-ridden 250 cc combustion engine uh bikes been placed at this in the past this is just so much easier it really is i mean you haven't got a clutch you haven't got gears you should have one or two things less to worry about so riding over the terrain it's much much easier and the lightness of the bike actually helps a lot in dealing with the sort of the off-road nature of tracks these but for me the biggest noticeable difference between this bike and also ridden the path combustion engine bikes is that software that alban mentioned before which really helps with the control at the low speeds the throttle is so smooth at those low speeds so picking your way through this just doing a few miles an hour it's actually really easy whereas with a combustion bike when you try to feather the throttle on the clutch and first gear you know it's it's a lot more difficult and that's i think one of the biggest things that makes this bike attractive for me for taking off road that and the fact that it only weighs 69 kilos so for someone who falls off a lot and therefore to pick it up a lot that's a bit of a bonus as well so yeah i can see why bikes these are making a big impact on the market in europe and north america [music] these are great off-road electric motorbikes and actually one you can use for commuting and on the roads they've been on the market the last couple years and that market really had a gap which these filled yes you've got the lower end with the cheaper bikes that are lighter weight and less high performance the kuberg the dell staff the stealth and then the higher end the big heavyweight bikes 120 150 190 kilogram bikes the the ktm free rider or the zero fx and then in the middle sat the cake fast light and i've got to say fun to ride there is a new bike in the market from uh super soccer the tc max which is almost um in the same sort of vein as as the cult so off to see how that performs in the future but for now this is champion of that market for me personally it's the exquisite build and design that i absolutely love if apple made off-road electric motorbikes they'd make these ones of course it's a big thank you to our patreon supporters and our youtube members without who support episodes this would not be possible

Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfFuEGsL_PpPRqj6Tf3cwY7n,pgSnSSqo_mg,hello and welcome to fully charged coming to you from the amazing old racing circuit the banked racing circuit at brooklands in surrey okay it's not a racing circuit anymore it's now country park waves very lovely and i'm riding on my go cycle now i've had this bike for about 18 months i absolutely love it it's got me back into cycling for a gentleman of my age don't judge me it's really useful when you're going uphill because it kind of gives you a bit of extra oh it's wonderful folds up it's really really light for an electric bike it's amazing i absolutely love it time come i've come here to meet richard thought from go cycle the man who's behind the whole project because they've come out with something that folds up it even easier and is even better so they're constantly reiterating the bike they're constantly updating it battery is getting better all that stuff you're going to tell me all about it so let's go cycle [music] [applause] yeah we're celebrating our tenth year anniversary right this year with our new gx model which is our fast folding model so it takes our hour in the history of our g1 g2 g3 which you were to have and our gs models and it says you know let's make it a little more easy to fold so that people can actually use this product in a city where they're getting on a train or taking it into their their place of work whereas our existing products the folding is mainly for storage hard to take it on the distance or if you have a boat or a car or something that i was living right in central london when i developed the product and writing normal bikes had two of them stolen and so you know having things a slightly more compact bar spacing because wing mirrors you know and hands do collide sometimes yeah and certainly yeah the dna of the product is definitely about but about the city the clean feature so that you can take it into your flat or apartment or into your space of work without feeling people are looking at the greasy change yeah it's a real plus side i'd sort of forgotten about until i put it in the car the other day and i went oh i've just carried it under my arm and i don't have a massive chain mark on there's nothing i mean it was fine you know there's no sort of exposed oily bits yeah that's always have that was from the get-go something that i was very very clear i needed to do in the product having had those other other normal bicycles and having taken them into your flat you always get a bit of grease the tracks its way through and you know for the go cycle it was right everything's got to be enclosed so even if you're storing your product inside your your flap in in an assembled way everything should be clean yeah so on the very short distance i've been so far on this it it feels a bit more stable or so unless with even mine the g3 he's got a bit more of a sporty steering geometry and fork geometry also those of our new all-weather tires so they're a little more grippy than the standard g3 tires them on there with every new go cycle we make subtle improvements along the way so i just want to point out to viewers that the go cycle itself is so quiet you can't hear so you can't hear it what you're hearing is the fabulous fabulous camera rig that we're using which does have a little electric motor that's just beneath the camera and it does make a bit of a the fantastic specially built fully charged mobile eco-friendly camera rig one of a kind and it looks about as stable as me when i've had a rather large glass of red wine [music] so actually this is going to be a good test version because the toners trunk space is not the biggest in the world so it's gonna be interesting to see if this will fit but this so this folds because i normally take the wheels off yep and fold down the handlebars and take the saddle out but yeah so you're gonna love this all right you're a go cycle owner already so you're gonna appreciate the advancement here so it's super super easy to fold right simply one latch on the side here so it's not even undoing a little twiddle oh just right yep i love that action and then the second sense here yallah goes and it folds down flush yep wow so you've got your falling petals here are folding pedals you flip those up there goodness sake now the only thing is the second i would take this out it's very easy to take off so you can take that office in this mode you there's a handy little clip on here which then allows you to wheel that around so you don't have to brilliant into your office yeah or into your home wow if you want to go into the car you take it one one step further you might take off the seat here yeah that's got there that's so that's the same as mine yeah better to use yep it's such a good idea it makes it so easy it takes half of that so out the saddle comes and then you've got a handy little oh what's this - well right and that slips down into this the seat holder look at that and then you can pull that closed wow that is brilliant so then what shall i try and give it in them well if l tell you well no you do one must wanna step further if you wanted to go down even further you can put the kickstand up yeah so it gets a lot more compact right yeah and then to put it in the car obviously want to go cycles nice features quite lightweight yeah most do you bikes you'd struggle to do this yeah electric and electric let me just see will it pass the acid test oh that is amazing i'm just ashamed at the filth on the back of the car but that is so good isn't it that is so neat wow and also i mean if that was in your kitchen or in your hallway it's not taking up a great load of reality [music] i do remember asking you when i first saw them when we first met about region and ever since then i've regretted that question so you know then you go down the hill you go you don't want regen on a bike yeah talking about it's it's i mean rg3 now is 375 watt hours the gx is 300 watt hours it's it's a stat on a piece of paper that people are interested in yeah and i think it's a bit cars with range anxiety people just want to know they've got enough power but we in in all the celebrating our 10th year anniversary this year and all those 10 years we we've not really had anyone that's complained about the range right sorry every one or two years about 25% more capacity in the cells ok the price keeps trickling down so instead of having a quite a complex system for regeneration adding a few more cells is a lot more efficient so you're seeing a living an increase in energy density and a reduction in price yeah everyone talked about but it's not yet reflected in the cost britons of electric cars you're not seeing this yeah i think the price points are still not going to be coming down because everyone's trying to do something new for the next buyer yes so we're still not at that point where we're gonna see dramatic cost reduction right but in terms of battery life because that's the question i no longer think about having driven electric house long enough to know they last long enough but then i presume do you still get asked that i mean in terms of these batteries yeah i mean if you had to replace batteries in any well it's it's an interesting one i mean we'd recommend in our owners manuals that people actually recycle the battery after five years right okay five years seems slightly shorter than i would have expected in terms of the life of the battery but is that because you've got a smaller capacity of charging it full of draining it more no i think that's basically the same thing about having a five year old computer right it's just everyone gets a no view that the latest battery is just so much better yeah and i think five years is about well actually also in that time with the constant increased energy but you're gonna get a better battery exactly that's not the same as you can recycle about so it's not that the original ones have worn out it's just that you could replace it now you'll get further range rattling exact same weight but you'll go further yeah this is probably a bad analogy is probably choosing to get a hit hip replacement ten years earlier you know why you're giving battering i've been considering i've got a couple of hips replaced no thankfully my hips are still working knees yeah question [music] el chico that is a big that is a really big improvement because that's the you know that when i have taken mine on a train i basically took one wheel off and sort of folded up as best i could but it was kind of how fold it and put it up in the luggage rack but that is really simple yeah quick it's a little bit bigger but the convenience of the fold is quite a nice you know so you know it's just a reverse the other way yeah undo your your security hook yeah you see that is right such a simple thing just to keep it otherwise it's going to be flapping right now yeah right turn that down and then you stir you little folding strap there one that is so easy wow you got your folding pedals the pedals are brilliant wow and yeah oh really good off to the races very impressed with that because what i've been riding mine for a year and a half the stuff i love about it is the software it just works the app and pink and it connects to the cook bike and i can tell how much the battery is how far i've ridden how fast they're gone don't let all that stuff we we probably led the industry we were the first production ebike to have bluetooth a standard in 2012 so we've had some time to get that app dialed in and the connectivity to work and then if you just put your foot under the wheel here and then you can swing it back balance it oh well that is so easy except i got it wrong what i can see that that is very easy yeah you've got to steer it a bit that is brilliant that is very good you know you'll hear people from across the political spectrum yeah saying well there's really dirty yeah you know yeah there's no argument about that might you know regardless of climate change or any other bigger impacts the air i'm breathing on my street and my kids are breathing on my street is disgusting because of these because of diesel you know it's as an petrol but you know mainly diesel and particularly in this country because we adopted diesel to such a high level with private cars you know it's just it is a disgrace and if you don't live in there in an urban area i don't and then you go in when i go into and i go oh my god yeah you really really punches you in the face i mean really unpleasant so i mean yeah and when you go you know we've just been an absolute you know why don't we that because this the majority of people get around apps to them on trams and bikes yeah the vast munoz a few people that use cars and delivery vans and things that well they've they've all got to be electric very soon even the boats on the uh niles you know and you just goes for goodness sake that's not that hot i mean it's a smaller city than london but still yeah i mean we were at a conference just recently one ebike specifically right which was also i think an interesting sign that people are starting to say actually we don't have to include other types of vehicles there's enough of a momentum in one category here right and there was a person there giving a talk about all of the predictions of ebike usage and numbers sold in the eu in general and there's a there's a feeling that you know it could be out all their predictions could be out by factors of 10 right yeah pickup right yeah so it's it's a pretty exciting time now yeah yeah [music] well all i can say is if you get the chance get on a pike it's so much it's the best way to travel after walking it's you know the low impact ness per mile of this bike is just phenomenal really want to write thank richard that all the people that go cycle really wish them well with this project i think this is a fantastic bike that's all we've got time for also do to fully charge on the youtubes or even on facebook don't tell anyone but it's on there too and have a look at the patreon link that is underneath this and you know as always if you have been thank you for watching [music],-1
Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfFuEGsL_PpPRqj6Tf3cwY7n,_Qag-AxNPhg,[music] getting stuff from a to b is one of the great logistical problems of our time and we just need to do better at it we need to be more efficient we need it to be more sustainable we need to sort this out and that means experimenting this little vehicle here is a very good experiment and it might be about to contribute quite a lot to this problem more than you might initially expect but what is it is it an e-bike is it a van is it a flex plant on wheels well we're about to find out welcome to fully charged [music] don't forget our great ev giveaway and enter for the chance to win one of several electrifying prizes including one of four electric [music] cars [music] adam thank you for having us visit so the name of your company is eav which is eve right so tell us what that is so electric assisted vehicles limited um we wanted to humanize the name so give it a name it's all better it's got its own it's got its own name yeah well i quite that your adam and it's eve i don't know whether that was interesting that was that was completely fluke but actually it works works quite nicely so what is eve all about so we wanted to basically engineer a fit for purpose vehicle that bridged the gap between e-cargo bikes and vans so all the benefits that e-cargo bikes give you pedestrian zones but then all this sort of comforts of not getting absolutely soaked in british weather with a roof and this sort of product-like visual that we've got so that commercial companies can adapt their fleet mix to these sorts of vehicles and where are you coming at this from because i think you know there's there's loads of great ideas bombing up at the moment and everyone's coming at it from different directions so what's your way into this my way is to listen i'm a designer i to hear what the customer actually requires and then we build product for them and actually we need to have a dramatic shift in how we transport goods and people and what part of that because obviously transport can involve big cargo ships and trains and lorries and what part of the game is this this is pretty much strictly in the sort of last final mile um arena the reason for that is the the the usually the total cost of any final mile is 50 of the total cost of the delivery which is just astonishing i mean that's one you have to listen to that so 50 or more of the cost is just the last little bit we're going to look at all the details of this but just tell us a little bit to start with about what it's made from so yeah the things the bodywork for example they're made from a natural flex fiber with a bio resin so you know technically it's end of life cycle means that we can actually do something positive with it either by degrade it or you know reuse it we've got polypropylenes in the materials as well which is obviously very recyclable just simple steels and alloys that we can also recycle as well part of our business model is also that we that we control the life cycles of the vehicle so we're going to do a subscription model whereby the vehicle comes back to us every two three years and we repurpose it upgrade it and make sure that the sort of longevity of these vehicles is sort of maximized over its over its material lifestyle you know you are quite new there's all these incumbent companies big ones and small ones that are hanging around what reactions are you getting i think it's it's been widely accepted as a good looking product the best reactions that we've got is actually the pedestrians don't mind it at all they actually think it's it's quite nice our customers customer see see it as a very uh positive product that their stuff their goods are being delivered in cyclists it in in cycle lanes we haven't had a mad cyclist yet and also cars it because it's got brake lights indicators and all the rest so we sort of idea to a multitude of of people that could be offended by it but at the same time it doesn't offend does it does anyone not it yeah other cargo bike companies fair i think i think we'll take that accept that the competition doesn't it apart from that brilliant well i'm quite keen to see what it does so can we see it in action yep let's go and have a test ride [music] so take us around the design because you've thought about every single little bit of this so just give us show us what's in here everyone knows how to ride a bike or most people know how to ride a bike so you had to be very familiar in in the terms of you sit on it you pedal it you steal left and right it then has an added layer of sort of automotive features indicators and brake lights etc but essentially it's very simple you pedal it gives you assistance and you reach a speed that you've set it to so it's an e-bike in the sense that it's it's regulated as e-bikes are it's got the same top speed it's got the same limitations on power of the motor and all that kind of stuff and so we've got handlebars in here so it's sitting in here you're just sitting on a little in a bike and the battery is is that it there is that yes this is a removable battery we expect the battery size dependent upon the customer's requirements for it's it's days worth of use there's no point specking a battery that can do 100 miles if you're only going to do 20 miles a day we generally spec the battery to the size um that they require and they can have multiples of batteries as well but the the standard battery that we do will do about 35 to 40 miles during our development process we've obviously recognized where parts fail under the loads and the stresses that we're putting them under in this scenario one of the most interesting parts of it is actually it doesn't use normal bike tires because we're dead upright we don't lean our vehicles so we develop these tyres or a verdistein they're quite chunky aren't they yeah they're they're incredibly high load rating as well they'll do 175 kilos per corner you know the top speed limit is at 15 miles an hour so presumably it could go faster but with cargo you're unlikely to be taking it faster than that and i think there's lots of discussions around whether that's that's not fast enough but in my head 50 miles an hour in a cycle lane is more than adequate and when you're carrying quite high loads and your gross vehicle weight is is relatively high you want to be able to make sure this thing can stop maneuver avoid a hazard and be able to do all of that in every weather condition imaginable so what's what around here so you've got uh your power on button which is on the left hand dashboard yeah power on and on this dashboard it basically gives you five settings and those five settings are related to your to your speed so it's yeah so five is obviously 15 miles an hour and you can reduce that down to you know so i'd probably put it on two for now get used to it fair enough you've got a little left hand thumb throttle there so that that gives you up to six kilometers an hour which is the legal limit for a walk assist that's the indicator yeah oh so you can't leave your indicators on because you've got gears as well to change your cadence but the the pedal set is not directly linked to the motor now the way i'd start it is i'd use the thumb throttle and you can it's got quite a nice bit of variance in there so if you sort of gently start going with it oh yes i think the um the camera that is just there should probably be [music] my there's almost no effort needed to put in on the cycling here um i'm not doing very much exercise it has to be said but every time i touch it really picks up quickly we're at an airfield i am now lined up down the runway and it feels i'm about to take off and it feels this vehicle could top speed go still a beginner at this but adam is an expert and he is making this vehicle do some things that i certainly wouldn't dream of here we go just watching a vehicle do that with that kind of speed is terrifying it's only going at 15 miles an hour and watching it it's just scooting around these obstacles and the serious point here is that if you're on a road and you need to avoid an obstacle you can clearly do it [music] what is absolutely ridiculous about this is that i can pull the handle wrap handlebars around all the way the wheels are at such an incredible angle here and i can stay upright and i don't fall over and it feels it feels so wrong to just you know just to turn a bike wheel that much and all of the engineering keeps the vehicle stable it's amazing they're doing their manufacturing on site here and what i about this is that you know their product is novel but actually some of the ways they're making these vehicles are pretty new as well however it does still involve a good spanner and i can see quite a few in their workshop here so we've got to the shop floor here walk us through the process what's going on so yeah currently we're just trying to blueprint our production process before we move into our larger facility so really sort of pinpointing down making sure that we've got all the right nuts and bolts and actually if we can get away with having three bolts rather than four making the production speedier standardizing parts etcetera that's that's what we're trying to prove out here you've the bottom bit of this is made out of steel why is that so we use a tubular steel um it's a specific kind of steel that's uh because we use the the tubes as a torque tube throughout the chassis so we've got active suspension but without any moving parts so i mean suspension is quite interesting because one of the things you know most bikes don't have suspension but you've actually you're building this into the structure here yeah so we it's an active chassis we call it our cloud frame chassis um that's a new one on me yeah so what we tried to do is that when we first started talking to uh customers what they don't want is maintenance they want absolutely zero maintenance um so the more the least moving parts you can have the better it means you've got less parts to go wrong so what goes on top so our body work basically um as we've discussed it's made out of a natural flax fiber composite um the fibers look a little bit this it's knitted this is genuinely knitted what is this stuff so the stuff that you've got in your hands there is a natural flax fibre and polypropylene co-mingled material that's the future of our production i'm fascinated by this because it's flax is clearly a natural material we know it's used to make it can be used making ropes for years that kind of stuff we know it's a good structural material i've never seen it used to make a structural component so there's fibers of flax and then the polymer sits around the flax how how does that work i mean if we go back to the sort of the start and why why we won't actually want to use the fibers in the first place obviously it's it's a byproduct of producing flaxseed an unused byproduct in general that in theory could be grown in a field literally around the corner processed by ourselves made into a material that can then produce components this within a mile radius of its source and that for me is where i want to go with the with the process because we shouldn't be sort of importing goods from all around the world expelling loads of energy to just move materials and components around that's not sustainability in my mind so let's just go through the process it arrives with you in some in something this is that right and what happens to it next here on site so we'll have a female mould um it will obviously get draped into the mold vacuum down using a vacuum bag yeah and then literally thrown into an oven at about 190 degrees cool down and then it pops out apart it looks this and you can make it any shape you want within reason within reason once you understand the material you can then design components around your material properties so it's got lots of nice sort of properties for commercial applications that that far outweigh the the sort of the competitor materials that are out there on the market today sustainability is one of those words that means a lot of different things to different people but when i think of sustainability i think of you know we live on the planet with a fixed number of atoms and basically all those atoms have to go round and round and it's not about recycling being this alien concept part of sustainability is you have to make things out of the waste of what went before yeah so this material i mean flax sounds biodegrade but once it's got a polymer mixed in with it what's what happens can it be recycled can it be reused what happens it's a melt out process and then you can separate the two materials off one can be thrown in the ground and the other can be recycled over and over again [music] what i really about what they're doing here is that they started their design really from the bottom up they looked at the very raw problem and they designed a vehicle to solve that problem so it's not just a case of them having made a great toy because it's a great toy they've really listened and i have a right be in my bonnet about this i think that we need engineers to listen more to what the world wants and that is absolutely what they're doing here i think it's brilliant [music] so here we are at ocado and this is an ocado eve just the others but this one this one is an eve cool which means it's got a refrigeration unit inside it so we're going to follow this along on one of its journeys [music] [music] [applause] [music] well you've just got shopping in mystery brown bags what do you think of the transport we've got here i think that's fantastic because one of the problems of course with home delivery is cars clogging up the roads and emissions and parking so it's lovely to see something much more environmentally friendly delivering my shopping so adam we've just been following these around the streets what's it feel to see them on the streets how do you feel you see them it's quite nice for me it's nice to sort of analyze how people react to them from the from both the road from the pedestrians and the cyclists as well which is always it's always been quite positive really i really noticed cycling in london that you notice the fumes you know especially when you're stuck in traffic you sort of don't want to breathe in and low emission zones are becoming very popular so how do these fit into all of that i think where these these will definitely come into their own is is yes low emission zones are important but actually it's pedestrianization and the the growth of those yearly zed zones and the pedestrianization zones that mean that vans will not be allowed to go into the centre of cities anymore and that's where these take over so we made an episode about ecargo bikes a few months ago and when that episode went out i got a few emails a few tweets saying oh well they're nice little toys well done they're very cute they're never going to scale up they're never going to be a solution it's always just going to be a niche thing what is your reaction to that i mean i think people people are afraid of change you know um i think covert has been an accelerator for change and actually people are a lot more open minded now people that are sort of negative towards them they don't really see what the future is and they don't really see that the vehicle is going to be pushed out of the city centre quite rapidly not in sort of 10 20 years in you know within a year within two years paint is a picture of the streets around here if the world goes your way if adam was king of the world for the next 10 years you could reorganize transport what would it look so we call that project transport futures for eve so we're already we're already thinking about that we're already working with large blue ship corporate companies to to basically brutally change the way you transport goods and people around the city centres it's not necessarily about electrifying fleets because it's just seen to be green but you're not really changing anything yeah and i think as the government's trying to roll out their their zero emission goals they're going to have to turn to companies ours that don't have any legacy operations don't have any legacy vehicles that are you know 10 years in development and they have to sort of you know expel their r d costs over another 10 years we can start from fresh with a clean sheet of paper and design something that's actually fit for purpose for the problem that we have right now okay well thank you very much it's been lovely to spend time with these vehicles and to see them out in the wild and it's a great project i wish you all the best for the future thank you very much [music] it's been really great to spend time with these vehicles i am all in favor of experiments and i think this is a very good one and honestly the thing that excites me most about this is this material the idea of taking using flax as the basis for a composite to turn it into a material which is strong and flexible and tough but it's also recyclable that i i'm very excited by that i think we need more of that and then the vehicle itself you know it's it does it does a job that needs to be done and it'll take time with all of these things to work out how it fits on the roads how it fits within with other things you know all of these experiments but you have to do it to find out what's going to happen so yeah i think these are great you know the technology is impressive i i'm really keen to see where they go next so that is it for this episode and if you have been thank you for watching [music] [music] you,2
Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfFuEGsL_PpPRqj6Tf3cwY7n,vH2MmgiF7gQ,[music] [music] [music] [music] this is the zero srf and i've been given the chance to ride this for the day and in many ways it's comparable to the harley davidson live wire in the sense they're both fun to ride street fighter bikes designed for a bit of commuting and a bit of sport as well and they're also to the best selling motorbikes in the world unfortunately i don't have a harley davidson live wire today but i do a friend that does have one [music] [music] jolly hey how are you thanks for helping us out today um and this i assume is the uh is the harley yes it is yep that that's um this is a quite different version of the one that that we rode from um the bottom of argentina and it was it was quite funny because harley davidson when we when we approached them they they because they've got their their new pan american launching quite soon and um anyway this was back in 2000 um end of 18 beginning of 19. and we said look we we're thinking about going on this adventure and i thought it's brilliant they're gonna want our pan american and you know the the bmw gs and um and then they said and then we said well actually we'd to go on your on your electric live wire and we'd you to make it look the pan american so they'd spend all their time on this bike so then they had to build another bike right how do you guys are doing it but on the live wire it's not the first bike that springs to make because it's not a street fighter style bike it's not the usual thing that you well it's harley davidson as well i mean i mean people you know when you said people when we were riding through south america on on these bikes you know people say oh you're doing another trip or you're doing a trip how fantastic and what do you want and we said we're on electric bikes and they'd say oh wow and they said what bikes are they would say harley davidsons and they just would start laughing and but i think i think what's very interesting is is um because because you're you're on on the on the zero yeah they're their latest bike and and and we actually um looked at zero for long way up as well and and um and i think at the time we we decided that that you know we decided on on the harley davidson but but um but it was a real close it was a real close thing my first impression of that is it's it's it's nice i think they've gone up a big step from from from what they had before you know they've they've gone in with the with the um with the lcd screen which i think was needed you know their last one was was was you know it was a bit old-fashioned the whole bike felt a bit old-fashioned um this one has got that that look of that it's slightly that sort of ducati it's the frame of the frame and and that and that and that the the suspension on the left side there you know it's it's a tidy looking bike it really is it's got a little bit of the ktm look on the front you know all everyone steals everybody's idea there's no new idea yeah is there you know well that's enough talking let's uh if you jump on your charlie davidson motorbike and i'll jump on the zero and we'll take a spin [music] [music] [music] [music] i've actually spent quite a lot of time on this bike which is the the harley everton live wire uh went from the bottom of argentina to la on it um with ewan mcgregor and we did long way up and um so we went through the whole thing of the range anxiety of it all and plugging in i mean there were no fast charges so we just spent the whole time with the generosity of people and plugging into their into their power on a pin socket so um it was quite a it was quite a thing to get your head round for the charge of it all but once you got used to it all it turned out to be one of the most fantastic things because it wasn't so much about about huge distance but it was about uh about the people that you met along the way and that you were sort of not only plugging into people's houses but you were plugging into people's lives the first thing you notice with a bike the zero is the power this thing will produce about 140 torque and that's just as well actually because though though the bike needs the power because it's quite a heavy bike it's about 220 225 kilos although most of that weight is down low so the center of gravity is uh is actually pretty low making it nice and stable so the ride position is pretty good i mean i'd prefer for me the the fruit pegs be a little bit lower but that's because i've got pretty messed up knees and hips so um but the feet pegs steadily feel a lot more a racing bike than a touring bike or or some of the street fighters i've ridden in the past but it's comfortable the seat again for me is nice deep set so you've got short legs me you'll you'll find that quite nice so one of the things that you notice straight away when you ride an electric bike is that there's no engine noise and then you realize that when you ride a bike there are there are three sensors there's that there's a movement the wind the feel of the road and the engine and the engine really gives you an idea of how fast you're going depending on the revs so when that's taken away it takes a moment to realize on the on the electric bike that feeling but once but you quickly forget about that because what you then realize is is is that your you you feel a little bit more connected to the to the to the road and and and your your your connection of what you're going over and the feeling of the bike is much more intense so because of that engine noise is gone you you you feel the bumps and you hear the bumps and you feel what you're riding on much more which is super interesting so it gives a very different feel and that's one of the biggest things you notice on on the electric bike the other thing you notice on an electric bike is that the power oh look here we got here look a lovely old bsa nice bike by the way now talk about the old and the new that's a very old bsa and this is a very new harley-davidson so but the other thing that you really notice once you've got over the electric of it is that this bike in particular handles incredibly well i mean it really does it handles a sports bike which is very strange for a harley davidson because you know harley you'd expect a v-twin cruising bike you know not necessarily known for its cornering and then you sit on this and it's an all-out you know naked sports bike so it's got various modes and so you can change the effectively the performance on the the efficiency of the of the bike you can choose to put in the sportier modes that'll give you max acceleration maximum speed you know all that sort of stuff maximum performance but it will chew into your range and your battery power or you can switch to one of the more economical modes eco mode um where your top speed will be limited to 70 miles an hour um and the acceleration won't be as good but your battery will last a lot longer so this bike will do a maximum speed of 124 miles an hour and it'll sustain a speed of about 110 miles an hour that is in the top the sports mode if you were to uh crack it down to the eco mode it would limit you at 70 miles an hour to conserve battery power there is one other mode when the battery gets down to below 10 percent it goes into kind of get you home limp mode and that severely reduces the the acceleration and performance of the of the bike and also i think limits you to about 40 miles an hour the idea is that um you know it's good for maximum conservancy in order to get you home or get you to a charge point so charlie you've had you've been riding the harley for a couple of years now yeah so what have you what have you discovered that i mean i i tend to get the bikes for day and that's it so how's it changed your riding your life how does it compare to you know when you're riding combustion engine bikes i think what's really interesting about having spent so much time with electric vehicles is is that you know your everybody i think people are afraid of of the electric of it all yeah you know and you know someone says an electric car they go well i'm going to get this electric car but it only does 300 miles i mean how can i how can i live you know i can't you know i can't live that and you go well hang on how many miles do you actually do a day yeah probably 20. you know this this bike will do you know it'll do 130 140 miles um urban so so around the surrey hills and london if you're doing a lot of a lot of motorway work or or or dual carriageway work then then of course your battery is going to sitting at 70 80 miles an hour it's not you know you're not going to get the same kind of range i think once you've once you've ridden these things for for a month or a couple of months you you then you then you know your range anxiety sent tends to go away but but all of that over you know all of that range of anxiety is superseded by how much fun these bikes are you know and most people certainly when they're commuting day to day aren't going to bang out 120 miles in a day and you've got to remember that it's going to it's costing you a pound 12 p to to charge it every day from home you know fast chargers are more expensive but then you don't really use them because you're you're just going back and forth if you are if you are going a long journey and say you are doing 200 miles and and say you do 125 miles on the on the charge then then and you if you only got you know you've got 40 50 miles left to go then you only have to charge it for 20 minutes to get to there so it's just about and that's just about getting used to it but you know but the great thing about these is that is that you know that that hundred miles that you're doing um in between is just puts a smiling effect every person who have who's written this you know as you're going along because you can hear them because because they are when we're riding together you know we can chat to each other quite happily because there's no engine noise but but every time someone has a go on this they go along and and they and they stop and they get off their butt and they take the helmet off and they are jibbering away with excitement and they've got i just had no idea how much fun this this bike is and so once you've got all of that then the real joy of the whole thing is just coming off the power a little bit here and the acceleration this is my body it accelerates faster than a ferrari testarossa and that's half a million pounds and this is 21 000 pounds naught to 60 in just under three seconds and it feels very agile and nimble it really twists around and you know it it feels it feels wonderful to ride it it is a very heavy bike because it has a big battery but but the way they've designed the battery so the battery is quite low and and the motor unlike a lot of other bikes the motor sits lengthways underneath the battery at the bottom of the bike here and so that means all the weight is very low so it does have that nimble feeling it doesn't feel heavy one thing about rider electric motorbikes is that it is just easier and a bit less stressful but that kind of lack of need to change gears does make it a very simple task you can concentrate a bit more on the road surface the environment you know and moving the bike around a bit now some people won't that some people the interaction that you get from having gears having that kind of that intimacy control you get with a combustion engine bike but i have to say it depends what you're using it for so if i was doing a daily commute of 20 30 40 miles i would take the bike i'd get electric bike it's just much easier you know for a hard day at the office you just jump on you can concentrate on just enjoying the ride they say this does 160 odd miles on the thing this this they say you know they they're a bit more modest about about about that so what what do they say that will do well this will do this one in town or in the surrey hills this where you're not sitting on a motorway you know you can get it between 130 and 140 odd miles and you've had that yeah yeah i've even had up to 150 in town yeah they claim one six one zero claim 161 but i don't know of anyone who's got that yeah most people even the uh the english elected motorbike company who bought us off today even they in their website say 100 120 marks yeah because my phone with this is that um in the sort of sport mode give max performance it's got the the least regent of break-in oh really this this one for for for sport mode this has much higher notions so i found this one about this one i could have spoke with the whole time obviously um is when you come off the throttle it's not as much of that engine braking that i would expect so i think i would first thing i'd do is if this was my bike i got the custom settings i put it on obviously maximum sport mode but with max and regen braking so uh storage wise i have got this massive boot here to store all sorts of stuff in look at that perfect so you can put your cable in there yeah when you're going to someone's house and stuff that but then but you but if you were going to get the extended range battery which is probably what you need yes you would lose that right so to match these two bikes on range then yes you need to get the extra battery which goes you lose the space there whereas the harley davidson has a clever little thing in the back here where you you have in the back you have your cure your cables kept in here and so they're always there actually that's something worth noting as well is that is that you can either put extra battery pack in there to make a bigger range or you can put a faster charger this this has got six kilowatt charging capacity you can double up to 12 which are half your charging time however that can stuck in rapid charge well this this has so you have type two type two yeah and this is i suppose what they call type three which is ccs so at the moment that is without the extended battery how much 19 and a half thousand ninety and a half thousand so this is 28. um with the extended battery uh it's going to be about 21 i think 21 20 what because it yeah 21 22 grand something that 3 2 22 in the end um so so so there still is a chunk of money there but not as much the difference isn't as much as a as it sounds is it but but you know i mean that's the problem with these bikes is they are still a little bit expensive aren't they [music] [applause] [music] [music] [music] jumping off the live wire and jumping back onto this my first impression is that they both feel quite similar riding positions the geometry between the handlebars and my seat and my feet seem very similar i think the balance of this bike is actually quite good where you compare it with the with the harley davidson um they both feel quite flickable um my my first thought is is that this this one is is much noisier than the harley the the the the motor has a lot more noise i'm surprised about that um and the the initial for throttle responses is quite abrupt on this and then it and it doesn't have the same kind of punch and and an acceleration all the way through as the other bike does so uh but other than that you know they're quite similar once you're on the go you know it feels nimble and fun i'd be quite happy to sit on it and ride for for a couple of hours would be absolutely fine i think for what it is and for the money i think it's not bad at all aesthetically and and how they look they're both quite pleasing to the eye aren't they um this has improved dramatically i think from the the sort of early models of zeros sure keen them looks weird this is a nice looking bike i think huge difference between them i think i think um i i have to say you know um i think you know the lines what they tried to do here is bring the lines and they try to bring it along along and join in the the rear suspension i i love that attention to detail they really tried hard to keep the lines going on this first time i saw one of those it had shades of that old-fashioned norton style look which i really as well you can see that the harley i i get the feeling that the harley has has has got a lot of buell in it which was which was one of their sort of sister companies i get the feeling that this one has a if you were trying to compare them with something this has it kind of feels a little ducati esque with a free you know with the frame and the way the suspension is laid and stuff that but you know they that they're they're good bikes yeah so you know i mean if if i was to look at the zero and the harley-davidson and you look at the other manufacturers you know there aren't that many bikes out there that that proper bikes to ride um and and i think that you know zero and harley davidson are certainly up there uh with with you know a couple of proper bikes to ride you know i i have to say i'm impressed if i was to choose money to object i would definitely go for the for the extra battery and this one for sure um and um you know if i was at a push you know even though i've i own a harley if i was at a push i i would still pick the harley as as the better bike but you know this is not that far behind it's a good bike well they're both good bikes i know you've got your firm favorite which is understandable and i've got i i i wasn't sure about the harley but i haven't seen it and i don't play in it and watch you ride it more importantly it's a it's a pretty good machine yeah no i mean i think they're both i was i was um i didn't know what to expect from the uh from the zero and it's come across really well i think it doesn't have the same kind of fossil response it i think this one is much more linear and and and i found that the uh that the zero was quite noisy that i was it was much noisier motor than the harley but other than that i think they were they were relatively you know relatively similar and i think both group bikes have got they've got differences definitely but if someone's thinking of getting something for commuting to work during the week and then having a blast at the weekend they're both worth taking out for a demo ride i think so i mean as much as as much as you do or don't um you know the electric is coming and and and i think um i think we you know i think if if you give it a go and and get over that little bit of of the um of the you know range anxiety syndrome you actually find that actually they're actually quite nice to ride any bike is a good bike as long as it's got two wheels it's it's got my vote yeah fair one well a few thank you so start of all thank you charlie for joining us today thank you to the english electric motorbike company for supplying the xero for me today uh thank you as always to our patreon supporters and youtube members without who support episodes this would not be possible if that's something you might be interested in then take a look at the links below apart from that as always we'll finish with if you have been oh yes i'm not sure what the tagline is but i think you've got to keep watching fully charged because you know that's where it all happens electrically what he said [music] you,2
Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfFuEGsL_PpPRqj6Tf3cwY7n,sFSJDSh1jmE,so today i'm going to start off with a lot of superlatives cheapest ev in the world smallest ev in the world outselling tesla of course it's this we finally get a chance to test drive it today and i'm really really excited but does it live up to the hype this is the wheeling mini ev this is fully charged don't forget to and enter to be in the chance to win in our great eevee giveaway where you could win one of four electric cars [music] cause no one can do it [music] so technically the full name of this car is the wuling hongwan mini ev and i'm really excited because we actually get to drive it here today for the first time now this is a collaboration between saic gm yes gm who make the massive trucks in america and wheeling and this car has outsold tesla in april of this year about five to one so for every one model three that was sold they sold five of these and it's not surprising why because the price of this starts at around 30 000 rmb we'll flash up the conversion rates down at the bottom of the screen now as you can see it's not a lot of money now has this car lived up to the hype will it live up to the hype will it look to people's expectations we don't know so let's take it for a little spin and find out more [music] [applause] [music] so one of the best things about this car is just how uncomplicated uh the driving is so i've just got in and driven straight away no instructions i know exactly where the buttons are because it's what i've been having gas cars or ice cars for the past 20 or so years and it's just getting and go drive and it's very simple and straightforward interestingly they've got an old school key so again they've really been thinking about how do we not over complicate it with some key fob system where you need to be close to the car and blah blah blah it all goes wrong simple key you plug in you twist it around just a gas car uh or petrol car you know same with a handbrake old school this is old school but with electric and i think this could be a very interesting future for the cheap ev sector if only more companies were thinking in this way about okay how can we cut costs but not make it such a miserable experience that no one actually wants to buy it we're at the front end of the wheeling mini ev and as you can see it's quite a boxy looking car it doesn't have much in the way of features around here but for this price i think that's okay now the one feature it does have on the front here is the charging port and let me see if i can push that yeah there you go uh unfortunately it's only got a slow charger so there's no fast charging fills on this so if you are going a long distance you're gonna have to wait about six hours to charge it you know that could could be an issue that's why it's perfect for a city run around not much else to speak about on on the outside here so i just want to talk about the battery which is sitting underneath this car it comes in two flavors one with a 9.2 kilowatt hour battery which is 120 kilometers of any dc range and then you've got this one which is 13.8 uh kilowatt hours which does 170 kilometers of any dc range not huge numbers it'll get you around the city for a couple of days before you have to recharge it i think that's fine interestingly this is actually quite an efficient car 8.1 kilowatt hours per 100 kilometers which is probably a lot more efficient than my own car and many other electric cars on the market [music] so i've been driving around in the wheeling for a few hours now and you know what comes to me is just how simple this car is and that's not a bad thing because i honestly think that a lot of the evs that we're driving now are way too complicated too many things potentially to go wrong and you know software and hardware can easily break down with this i've got a stop and go pedal i've got some basic controls here i do have a little screen up here telling my range um and how many kilometers i've done my drive mode and stuff but that's it that's basically all the tech is in there but no fancy maps no complicated menus nothing that so i think this has a lot going for it uh in terms of of the tech side if only a lot more cars could be offered just in this spec you can know you can have your fancy spec but just have a basic one this because if you want to get people to adopt these cars if you want to get people more people driving evs you just need to make them simpler less complicated and cheaper now i'm not spoilt for features in this car at all and i think this is where the cheapness really comes in sea of plastic it's only plastic in here i've got plastic on the dash i've got plastic down here and i got one of the most basic raiders you will have ever seen this is an lcd dial with two buttons and that's it now i've got some other buttons for the air conditioning over here which i can turn on and off uh a couple of other buttons over here and i've got a traditional handbrake down here so if i want to do some handbrake turns i don't know why it's rear wheel drive so maybe i've got that down here no electric seats no big touchscreen nothing that you know i can do my windows down here without having to look at a screen i can adjust my seat without having to mess around with buttons so what they've done by simplifying it is just make it so much better so whilst this is not a feature-rich car it's not devoid of features either so there's a few little facts i want to show you about the rear of the car first of all it does have parking sensors so when you're reversing it beeps and tells you you're about to hit something but to be honest it's so small that you're likely just to look out the back window and actually look yourself the other thing i want to talk about is the boot and the boot space so let me just open this here just press this button i have a few issues with this boot okay the first one is um yes it's about the same height as me so i have to duck down to actually get inside then obviously it's quite high up here as well there's literally no boots see i just hit my head there's literally no boot space with the seats up but if you've only got one friend and you don't have any friends for your back seats you can push these down to get 741 liters of boot space now i think i'm going to be able to do this just that and then you've got lots of boot space so actually quite practical now the back seats are are not too bad we'll have a look on the inside and see how i keep hitting my head see how actually how comfortable they are but you know if you're gonna if you're in a small shop and you've got some shopping or bits and bit bits and bobs you can just chuck them in here if you're a little bit shorter than me so i want to show you how difficult it perhaps is to get into the back seats but once you're in there it's actually not too bad so i'm going to try and climb in now so we've got a little button down here this flips forwards that's about it i can move it forwards if i want and then let's see if i can get in ah there you go i'll do it so once i'm in it's actually not too bad i don't have gargantuan amounts of leg room if i move my seat forward a little bit i've got a little window here i've got no usb slots i've got a little pocket here i can see the back window and i can touch the back window you know this doesn't do a lot of range but if you just pop into the shops with your friends or dropping them off at the pub or something you know you could do it in this and you know if you've got children they would fit in here as well so not not too bad a place to be but not a huge amount of features or leg room so this is actually the second version of the car there's the first version as well they they look identical basically i think there's a few minor changes but they've actually upgraded it slightly so i think the first one the very cheapest one didn't have air conditioning or an airbag so they've obviously thought well i think people want bit of air conditioning and some airbags so this one has both um it's actually very efficient i've already turned it on today it's very hot today about 30 degrees and it's really really efficient it doesn't really drain the battery that much i've still got plenty of juice left in the tank actually this screen is pretty accurate in terms of the range usually any dc range is a little bit pie in the sky but i think with this because you're only doing city speeds it's actually quite accurate even with the air conditioning on so what do we think of the wooling mini ev well i think this is a fantastic car for eevee adoption if people are going to be driving evs if they're going to accept these cars they have to get into cars these first it's very cheap it's fairly practical it's probably going to be quite reliable you know it gets the job done at a very very low price and that's what i think we need in the market for people to jump into cars these have that electric experience and then maybe they can encourage their friends to get an electric car as well that's why i think this car is so significant do i think it needs some refinement and improvement yes there's too much plastic in here i think it could do with some more sustainable materials maybe they can use some bamboo or something that um you know in terms of the the feeling of the drive it's a little bit boring but you know it gets the job done in a city shanghai you're not going more than 40 kilometers an hour anyway um so i mean that's all we have time for i hope you've enjoyed this episode of the ruling mini ev we've got plenty more episodes coming from china in the coming weeks and months we've got all the buttons all that lovely stuff around this including patreon youtube memberships the notification bell on all of those you know it and if you have been thank you for watching

Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfFuEGsL_PpPRqj6Tf3cwY7n,7p5Uym-YdAc,[music] hello and welcome to kensington one of the posher and swankier corners of london now when it comes to cars folk around here not super easily impressed ferraris lambos and porsches they're common as muck around this way but i think that the vehicle we're here to test today is so unusual so unique that even the good people of kensington are going to have their cosmetically enhanced jaws on the floor so what do you reckon pininfarina batista lotus avaya even better [music] and here it is this spectacular contraption is the carver and this is fully charged yes it's the great ev giveaway don't forget to and enter for your chance to win all sorts of prizes including one of four electric cars [music] [music] now first thing you need to know is that this is not a new idea it's not a new company if you go on youtube you can find a clip of a very young looking richard hammond testing one of these on top gear back in 2003. of course back then it was not electric i had a little motorbike engine the idea has come a long way since then and of course the unique selling point of the carver is wait for it that they call it dvc dynamic vehicle control and it's a patented technology and it is very clever it's not just a case of how much it leans depends on how much i steer it also depends on my speed and it serves two purposes number one it keeps things nice and stable don't forget the track on the rear of this is 98 centimeters it's a very narrow vehicle and if it didn't have the ability to lean through corners it would just topple over the second eye oh look at that turning circle it would just topple over the second i yanked the wheel to the side because it's very high center of gravity especially with big old me at the wheel and of course the second purpose of that leaning capability it is so much fun oh roundabout here we go oh yes look at that look at that up to 40 degrees of lean that is halfway to the ground i've never experienced anything it [music] let's talk a little bit about the design of the carver as you can see the whole thing is built onto this sort of steel frame which doubles as a roll cage makes you a lot safer than you would be on say a motorbike if the worst should happen this is quite interesting we've got this box down here if you don't know if you can quite see that this houses the batteries and all the essential components and what's cool is that doesn't lean that stays put along with the sort of rear axle the rest of the car leans to side and side and that stays perfectly intact why add extra weight to the leaning bit when you don't have to clever design it's very orange isn't it you don't have to have it in orange i think you do have to have it with a rear spoiler i mean you need the rear spoiler because otherwise it would take off with such forceful acceleration it wouldn't it's 30 mile per hour vehicle this is completely pointless but you know what it's a bit of fun the whole thing is a bit of fun it should be orange it should have a rear wing why not so what's it to drive well according to carver it offers the comfort and safety of a car with the simplicity and maneuverability of a scooter that's the idea here comfort and safety of a car yeah sure a very small car with three wheels but i'm enclosed not going to get rained on it feels perfectly carry in all the ways that matter but i'm less than a meter wide which means i can squeeze through gaps that cars would never fit through and look at this i should probably not be doing that zigzagging on residential street but i can because it's so small ah i can't even stress to you how rewarding it is to feel so narrow and compact on the road because all of a sudden i've got all this road to play with and i can take the racing line through corners you could have more fun in one of these in a city than you ever could in a audi rs e-tron or a jag uri pace this just makes sense in an urban environment do you know what i know someone who lives around here that would absolutely go crazy for this thing let's see if we can find him [music] it's lovely scarlett johansson on fully charged wonderful i mean of course and it's it's fantastic that she's a fan of the show don't take offense but we really really don't do it we don't do celebrity stuff and we've got a scarlet we've got our own scarlet oh bobby low as i live and breathe [laughter] that is amazing oh fancy seeing you around here that's amazing good morning good morning this is fantastic welcome to the carver the carver i've never seen one in real i mean i'm new about them i've never seen one in real life so can i have a go in it yeah come on i'll get in the back oh my god you can't well i'm gonna have to do a yoga pose to get in but we'll make it work and we can get in either side i've been stretching in preparation there we go look at that i cannot believe you got in there that is ridiculous look at that acres of space it's so easy for me to get in positively luxurious oh that's a two-seater are you sure you've got enough room absolutely let me just let me just put my seat belt on oh my god seat belt's on i mean this is all mod cons yeah very it's very nice i will say that it's definitely a roof down job with me in the back definitely got to be careful reversing there's not a lot of direct rear view that very true very true unfortunately the back is sort of well i mean i can tell you if we hit anything [music] oh my god we're carving it i mean because if you're just going absolutely straight you're in a narrow little car yeah that feels completely normal as soon as you move the wheel it's being on water isn't it it's more it feels more we're on water uh one of those things that you a motorbike that goes on water jet ski jets very jet ski x just a jet ski just pull out of the way of this bus oh that's so sad i'm getting better i'm getting into it now yeah it doesn't it takes 500 meters you'll be you'll be carving a legend and this is what you they're saying around a 60 mile range 60 mile range which is in a town it's all day basically you know driving around all day the battery is five point something kilowatt hours they reckon you can get a full charge for about a pound at home oh yeah easily if not less i mean i would say less you could do it for less i'm sure there's not many cheaper ways to get around town isn't it if you're paying five p a c hour at night that's five five that's 25 p for a full charge that is not a lot of money oh thank you see what did she say nice guys we are the talk of kensington that's fantastic i love the carver ah it is quite cozy it's a bit snug if i was a eight-year-old child this would be perfectly yes yes yeah no then it would be cool if your mum or dad picked you up in the carver after school i don't think it would be about anything you'd be imagine how much the kids would love this yeah oh god they love it yeah that is brilliant delightful that is such fun let's discuss the options available on the carver because oh yes there are different versions of it the base carver starts at just under 10 000 euros that is several thousand cheaper than a renault twizy about half as much as a smart 4-2 which in my mind are pretty much the only rivals that this thing has they've all got about the same range of 60 miles by the way then you've got the carver comfort then you get some really plush stuff floor mats and a phone holder and a bluetooth sound system you've then got the carver sport it has a sport button for punchier acceleration and black wheels and then perhaps the most impressive one of all the carver cargo oh yes there's a van of this and get this 500 liters of cargo space up to 500 kilos of cargo it can manage hugely impressive now it may strike you as a bit odd that we're testing this in posh west london because with its car the ability you'd really want this thing on some nice twisty v-roids but actually this is the carver's home it is a city vehicle range is limited to 60 miles which is actually pretty decent considering the five point something kilowatt hour battery and top speed is only 30 miles per hour this is a city car it would be huge fun slicing up country b roads in this thing but it just doesn't have the battery range for that and it's not really what it's intended for it is intended to make urban driving enjoyable it's designed to make people smile and not just the people driving it just about everyone i've driven past as well right i've been sent on a mission it's lunch time the crew are hungry i'm going to fetch lunch and in doing so demonstrate the outstanding city errand-running capabilities of the carver look at this chump in his smart car hey buddy just get a hummer [music] oh here's a spot parallel parking not in the car my friend just turn into the space oh yes sandwich [music] piece of cake sandwich delivery on routes [music] things really big and scary from down here [music] tell me what visibility is fantastic in here i mean i do have mirrors but i don't need them because if i just turn my head there's the entire outside world [music] let me give you a quick tour of the inside of the car because there are well it's actually quite finished in here it's a lot a small car we have a steering wheel not handlebars very strange sensation leaning into corners while working a steering wheel never had that before in my life here we've got dnr that's our gear selector buttons we've got a little hazard switch here we've got our indicators and our headlights we've got our windscreen wipers oh yes fancy stuff in here a little bit of storage area bluetooth sound system because this is the carver comfort we also have a couple of heaters we've got a de-mister for the windscreen little storage areas yeah quite nicely finished wondering how to charge it very simple my friend and you may be thinking well that's a bit annoying isn't it domestic socket or how do i bring it into my hallway well don't worry about that because with this fancy dongle here street charging also an option concluding thoughts then you know i came here today for a bit of a laugh and i certainly got one but i'm also going to be leaving a convert this is a fantastic way to get around a city if there's a better way to get two people across town i don't know what it is it's infinitely more fun than a twizzy it's about as comfortable about as refined but it leans that doesn't get old that does not get old now the use case is quite specific i think it's the ultimate school run mobile provided you have one child you stand on a street corner in london and count how many people are in each car as it goes past so rarely do you see more than two people in a big massive range rover suv and they don't fit down the streets and they inhale petrol and they just make no sense this is better and starting at 9000 euros you certainly wouldn't describe it as cheap but you compare that to an electric smart car it's a steel and i love how interactive the steering is i feel i'm back in the of ever arty electric porsche because the steering's completely unassisted so whatever happens to that front wheel goes straight through my hands it's just so much fun [music] do [music] well what a lovely day what a fantastic little vehicle i have seen the future today and it's orange and from the 2000s i'm not suggesting that a few years from now we're all going to be carving all over the place but just allow yourself to imagine a city where most vehicles were this size imagine how much better that would be as a pedestrian as a cyclist and as a driver it's just far more enjoyable oh and by the way 60 miles for a quid makes an awful lot of sense doesn't it there we have it the carver a fantastic little device do make sure to and and if you have been thank you for watching [music] want to see the carver in the metal and meet the whole fully charged team in person then come and join us this weekend at fully charged live you can get your tickets by following the link in the description down below [music] you,2
Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfFuEGsL_PpPRqj6Tf3cwY7n,n50tPjzJxXA,wow this is amazing this is the future [music] hello today we're in a very special location we're an hour north of shanghai at a factory in chengzhou and we're here to see a company that makes almost a million electric bikes per year we're going to see the whole process from building it together to quality to testing them now this company has only been around for a few years but they're becoming a part of the whole overall transport solution for cities it's not just cars it's not just buses but it's bikes as well we're at the new factory and this is fully charged [music] don't forget to and enter to be in the chance to win in our great eevee giveaway where you could win one of four electric cars [music] so how do you get to a million bikes a year well you start here you have 7 000 bikes in this room it's indiana jones in here but new are have only been around since about 2014 2016 in europe and they're in about 46 countries globally in china they've got over 1600 stores now in this room about 5000 of these bikes will be shipped out today so this whole room will almost be cleared out ready for the next lot what time is our train [music] why is it in water so here we are in the quality testing lab now i haven't seen any of these on my other travels but here we're seeing exactly how all the components work in different conditions the first one i want to point out is this they've got the buttons on the handlebars but they're underwater because obviously these travel in all conditions rainy conditions snowy conditions and they have to be tested to see if they're waterproof so this machine is just pressing that button backwards and forwards thousands of times underneath water to make sure it's up to standard now there's some other things in here which are very interesting as well there's a rattle test here for the uh the keys and the the the the charging system to make sure it doesn't all fall apart that's rattling very very fast at the moment um and then if you come a bit further down here these tests the speed and the the wheel alignment as well um but the what i want to show you down here is is the battery because that's that's the interesting part here so this is the the battery testing module here they've got individual cells in here from their bikes and they're charging and discharging charging discharging about 800 to 1000 times to make sure the batteries are up to spec and don't lose too much charge but that's not the only battery test here the other battery test that they're doing is over here which is the heating and humidity so they're just testing exactly how the battery is performing extreme hot extreme heat and extreme cold so this machine goes hot goes cold hot cold hot cold non-stop so it puts up the batteries under a lot of strain and stress and then they also have another couple of machines to experiment with water and the batteries to make sure they don't explode and there's no issues there at all they do a variety of other tests in here on the other side they're testing the the flexibility of the frame they're testing the speed they're testing at the durability of the bike as well [music] [music] so here we are in the factory space of new and it's a car factory but shrunk everything's very contents and um very close together because obviously the bikes are not that big so this is quite an interesting layout they've got three lines here producing three different bikes they're three main bikes uh for both china and export markets and i apologize it's a little bit noisy but over here we have the steel frames of the bike and that is where the bike really starts its life those are manufactured just somewhere else in the factory but that's the raw frame and they get prepared ready to have all the components put on it a lot simpler than manufacturing a car on this side we have the team putting together all of the the components such as the shell uh the wheels and some of the uh electrical components now interestingly these go down there as one line come up here and then they join the frames a bit further down over here so both lines converge together and they go down there and that's it and they get tested at the end of line very quick process and in fact they have about 400 workers here and they produce around 4 000 bikes per day so it's a very very busy factory [music] and this is the parts assembly that i just spoke about so here you'll see the handlebars some of the cladding some of the badges are all on here ready to be mated to the frame further down the line now it takes around about an hour and a half to produce each bite which is pretty quick but it can take as little as one hour for maybe some of the simpler bikes that they're producing i think some of the export bikes it takes a little bit longer because a little bit more complex but fascinating process completely different from cars and just so so much more hands-on than car manufacturing very very interesting [music] so we're in the showroom of new and we're just going to see some of the models that they are producing and are going to produce in the future they've got a few concepts in here as well and we're going to get a very lucky ride on one of these bikes a little bit later on so this is actually their original model this is the ngt this was released about 2014 2015 and this is very popular in both europe and the us now next to it is this which is a concept i think this was released at ces a couple of years ago unfortunately this isn't uh ready for manufacturing yet but they're beginning to think about the the wider range of transport solutions for the city so this is much more for a taxi bike as you can see it's got a very comfortable back seat so you can just jump on uh drive along it's got the two wheels at the front and one wheel at the back to increase the stability when you're driving around the city i imagine this would have a much bigger battery pack and then you've got the protection from the rain as well now the most exciting bike here is this one behind me so they don't just do mopeds anymore this is a proper sports bike this is the rqi pro and fully charged us we're going to be the first people ever to drive this outside of new so we're really excited to get on this later um i think it has about 110 120 120 kilometers of range specs haven't really been released yet because this is not production ready so it's kind of a prototype but they're hoping to bring it into production very very soon it looks amazing i can't wait to drive this now if you come over here we've got the gover model this is very very cheap this is quite low priced for china it's around about 3 000 rmb and it's meant for cities shanghai which have quite strict regulations in terms of headlight height rear headlight light the wheel size and things that so this is a legal scooter for shanghai [music] so this is how they transport all the goods in the factory they use modified scooters of their own as you can see this actually has four wheels so it's got two wheels on the side for stability and i can carry all of the components around the factory a brilliant way of using their products in the factory and a great way of getting things across to different areas absolutely brilliant this is great fun [music] now behind me you're gonna see the bike coming together so the frame has come along uh the components are coming off the moving shelves on the other side and it's all being put together now it looks quite naked at this stage the bike but it's actually only about 20 to 30 minutes from being finished and being checked and then going on the road as you can see there's about three or four people at each station and they're all drilling and making sure all the components are on the bikes properly it's such a fascinating pro process and i'm really surprised just how fast it's happening these guys are churning through bikes moving on to the next one and in a minute we're going to see the finished product [music] new are begin to think both high end and towards the bikes end of the market and this is another model that they're going to bring out this year this is the aero as you can see it's kind of a mountain bike but with a battery um and this is for the european markets this probably won't be released in china but it's just for overseas so here we have the aero as you can see i've got my helmet on we're going to take this for this for a spin i'm really excited about driving this because unfortunately it's not going to be sold in shanghai but it's going to be sold in europe so for everyone who's watching from europe look out for this i think this summer it's got a replaceable battery in here which can be taken out it's just my my own new bike battery um so i'll stop talking we can get moving so let's get on there so it's pedal assisted electric put this that up and then we can get going ah there we go oh that's pretty rapid i'm going faster than you guys so if i go a bit faster it gives me a bit more assistance it's got the classic new circular headlight on the front here you see the factory workers behind me coming back from lunch i'm doing about 18 kilometers an hour around the factory it's very very easy to ride so simple and i think it can get up to a pretty decent speed as well let's see oh there's a big truck coming as well this is very very simple super easy effortlessly cruising along i think this has about a 50 kilometer range so get you around a city and probably back home again and you're doing a bit of exercise at the same time if you live in a hilly city i think this would be very very useful so this bike is built for practicality and european cities so it's got a few things uh on this bike that i think are quite nice features so at the back you've got these two bags which are waterproof you can store all of your stuff in there if you go shopping a proper rack at the back here which actually feels very strong yeah suspension because obviously not every road is smooth this factory road and then you've got another space at the front here for a basket if you want now there's a couple of neat little features on here the first is you've got a key so you start it a traditional bike plug it in turn it on and you can open this and replace the battery so you can take the battery out put it back in you can take up to your apartment to charge it it's not actually very heavy i have one myself and i can charge it in my own apartment as well so that's a good thing that that my battery or my bike which is a moped is interchangeable with the battery on this bike as well so you can get a series of the products from here interchange the batteries very easily i do have a lcd screen here which tells my speed my battery i'm in sport mode at the moment so a few important things and most importantly it's got a bell let's see how fast i can go on this do you want to go a bit faster ready you go a bit faster than i'll try and keep up oh it's got gears as well it's it all changed down so i can get electric assistant on the top gears as well 30 kilometers an hour pretty fifth pretty fast a bit out of breath as well i'm going around the corner and luckily i've got lots of storage space on the back all of my bits it's a very practical urban run around lovely [music] [music] so here we are with the end of the production line of the gover model and as you can see they're coming off uh pretty quickly behind me we've got five bikes here all in different colors ready to go out to their customers next this is where they get checked over just any defects any paint uh issues and then they get shipped across into the warehouse what i can't get over is just how simple how fast and how efficient this factory is and how tiny it all is it just seems a very cute version of a car factory what a fantastic way to spend the day [music] now this is very exciting this is the rqi and this is their electric motorcycle this is still kind of a prototype it's a working prototype but we're going to be the very first ones to actually drive this now we're not obviously not going to go very far away in a car park in the factory grounds but look at it this really shows news intentions and they're really beginning to develop into other areas outside of the mopeds and bikes that they're doing now now there's not much i can tell you about this um all we know is that the range is probably going to be around 110 to 130 kilometers maybe it's gonna have the interchangeable battery we just don't know at the moment but what we do know is the feeling we're gonna get when we drive it [music] now i've i've got the throttle open at a very small amount at the moment we're already doing about 32 kilometers an hour now i'm not going to go too fast because obviously i don't have any protective gear on apart from the helmet so there you go and it's it's in eco mode it's not even in sports mode now we can really put it down i'm just i got grin from ear to ear this is just so cool wow i've never really driven a motorbike before this is amazing the maneuverability of this that's quite good for such a heavy bike it's actually very easy to maneuver just at low speeds it it really begins to feel very heavy for this speed oh amazing so easy just there's no clutch there's no fiddling about with your feet it's just go go go and keep going oh i think that's enough i think that's enough fun for today [music] so unfortunately that's all we've got time for i hope you've enjoyed the factory tour around new we've seen a fascinating insight into how they make close to 1 million bikes a year which are both good quality and with lithium ion batteries on the inside it's just one part of the overall transportation solution and i'm glad there's a company that's taking it really seriously we've got plenty more videos coming from china very soon hopefully a few more factory visits as well they've got all the lovely links around this including youtube memberships patreon and the button with the notification bell so if you have been thank you for watching [music] [music] you,2
Fully Charged Show,PLzD0K2OhbVfFuEGsL_PpPRqj6Tf3cwY7n,6k865qo-6mw,[music] [music] as the great and the good gather in glasgow for the cop 26 conference our fear is that when it comes to climate change talk is cheap so our message is very simple stop burning stuff love them or loathe them young people greta tunberg have a point governments the world over are just not acting quickly enough so in this special episode we're going to be focusing on the technologies that can tackle climate change here and now robert's going to be talking to the pioneers that are spearheading the shift to sustainable energy and electric vehicles but before we do helen takes a closer look at the science behind climate change and how combustion is the chief culprit when it comes to emissions over to you dr chersky [applause] each one of us has three life support systems our own body planet earth and the infrastructure of our civilization climate change is a problem because it puts the planet and the infrastructure into conflict with each other and we need both to stay alive so how does our planet work well it's got two major rules energy flows in from the sun hangs around for a bit on earth and then flows away into space so earth is just borrowing energy from the universe acting a reservoir and while it's on earth all of that energy runs the planetary engine the winds the ocean currents and life the energy acts on mata and the atoms that are on earth are the only atoms that we have there is no way unless we throw valuable atoms off our planet which would be a waste so here are the two rules of earth energy flows through and mata the stuff goes round and round so what have we humans been doing well we have burned a lot of fossil fuel and all of that burning releases carbon dioxide a lot of carbon dioxide and when that gets into the atmosphere it slows down the energy flow away into space it basically bungs up the plug hole so what's happening is that as you slow down that flow of energy away energy accumulates inside the earth's system so how does a planet store energy well mostly it's stored as heat and that's why climate change has been known as global warming all of that extra energy will also change the way the engine works it'll change wind patterns rain and drought patterns and where animals can live and migrate to those are the consequences of climate change and they're already happening so what should we do about all of this you can try to apply sticking plasters to all the things that are changing but we'd need an endless supply of sticking plasters and we'd never get rid of the underlying problem carbon dioxide causes other problems changing the chemistry of the ocean so it isn't just about the heating but the solution to all of this is clear we need to unclog our atmosphere and let energy flow away into space at a faster rate and that means we need less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere urgently and that means we need to stop burning stuff now the sheer scale of this problem can make it seem insurmountable but the good news is that the technologies that we need already exist in fact they are already being deployed around the world they have momentum but further acceleration from governments is critical significant progress has been made already and it's important to share the success stories that show what is possible here in the uk while gas still predominates wind and increasing efficiency has played a huge role in pushing coal off the electricity system in less than a decade and as the british isles is blessed with considerable coastline we are only at the beginning of an extraordinary shift to wind power now most countries have their own renewable resources to draw from australia for example has an abundance of solar and the nation is going through a rapid transformation from laggard to leader as the cost of solar plummets south australia also boasts the tesla big battery and the 194 megawatt hour grid connected energy storage system has alleviated the use of gas-fired generators and provided grid stability too when the loyang a coal generator tripped in december 2017 the hornsdale battery delivered 7.3 megawatts to the grid in mere milliseconds while progress on electricity whether it be generated by wind solar or hydro and aided and abetted by batteries has been dramatic in the uk at least there is a big question mark about heat again we believe it's electrification that will be by far and away the biggest beneficiary of this switch heat pumps in particular are a success story in europe even in the colder climes of scandinavia and there are tens of millions of hyper efficient air source heat pumps already in operation what's more when it comes to the electrification of heat other options are emerging too when it comes to electric cars norway again is leading the way with pure electric cars accounting for the vast majority of cars now sold in the country but it is not an isolated incident it is spreading across europe and even in combustion engine obsessed germany one in five cars sold is now pure electric across the border the netherlands is showing that there is another way dutch bike culture has been given a boost by electric bikes with e-bikes now accounting for more than half of bike sales there it goes to show that we don't necessarily need to replace one car with another as electric micro mobility brings in with it an array of alternatives including scooters bikes trikes mopeds and micro cars in terms of other electric vehicles china is blazing a trail when it comes to electric buses and electric taxis while we ring our hands about trialling a handful of buses consider chinese cities shenzhen which on its own has a combination of more than 40 000 electric buses and taxes in operation today in summary we have the solutions it's time to roll up our sleeves and deploy these proven technologies as rapidly as possible and now it's time to talk to the leaders who are actively working to scale up cleaner greener technologies about what we all need to do to stop burning stuff [music] [music] can i start with you i mean can you tell us about what your business is and and how you see it developing in the future yeah so the overall goals of gridsurf are to deliver sustainable energy on such a scale that we can help move the needle on climate change um clearly quite a thing to take on but it's down to us us alone this generation given the time frames we have available to us and the way that we're going about it is we're building a new ecosystem that stops burning stuff you know topical for this which we call sun to wheel so we're generating clean energy from solar projects we are then using batteries to kind of balance that energy we are installing new charging infrastructure so we've just delivered over 100 charging locations in the last 100 days across the uk and we're putting that energy into electric vehicles and that kind of in terms of the electric vehicle side we're leasing electric vehicles and everybody every person who leases one from us we plant 100 trees as well which you know reduces the carbon from the last vehicles that we're burning stuff so that's the overall plan that we have and we're delivering that in the uk and we're looking to scale up across the world jordan my energy really i think a very close uh company to fully charged we i met you when you literally just started just give us a brief history of what you're doing and how fast it's changed because it's great you've grown so quickly it's extraordinary so we look at the industry very similar to gridserve and toddington but more on a residential focus so we manufacture ecosmart home devices for ev charging and heating basically our products work with and encourage people to adopt solar energy within the home or switch to a green energy tariff so we do the same for balance in the home and just moving the energy around a little bit smarter in the home making sure that we stop burning stuff for the energy consumption but what we have seen the industry is just skyrocketing from that time in orkney where we had a prototype charger in the woods running off a wind turbine you know we were shipping 35 units a week at that time we're now getting close to 3 000 a week so you can see the scale in such a short space of time of um we manufacture all in the uk as well which is close to our hearts for keeping the production in the uk and trying to look at that supply chain as well and for the whole circular economy so and quentin you and i have been no i think it's fair to say knocking around on telly for quite a few years here and there you i think i'm gonna we're roughly the same age you've been doing it longer you're much more professional [laughter] but we've also been driving electric cars for years and years and years and that's great since 2009 in fact but then you're now working with with uh british vault which is really fascinating so i'm a kind of eevee evangelist and always have been and and for me batteries there will be no energy transition without batteries and i don't think we quite get that in this country so british vault have this 93 hectare site up in northumberland and are going to be the uk's premier manufacturer and research and development of batteries as well so the big problem here is robert that if we don't have batteries here in the uk the entire motor industry will go to where the batteries are and that will be abroad and we don't want that we need to keep the the uk motor entity here we need to supply domestic made researched batteries so british fraud are really well tied into people the warwick manufacturing group university and the faraday institute and and they're researching new electrochemistries for batteries lithium ion phosphate and solid state and stuff that it's about green batteries but also developing battery chemistry so they are lighter they are more dense the range are longer the recycling is is is greater and and designed batteries that can be used again and again and again sometimes four life cycles into static static energy as well so it's really really exciting jordan i mean can you talk about this the the the fact that we need to develop a circular economy this goes beyond anything to do with electric vehicles just generally in the way we live what we have done is dig stuff up generally burn it and just ignore it and now we've really got to sort of change the whole way we think of manufacturing and how we use things that's it i mean it's going to be a global effort right everybody has got to be on the same mindset to make something truly green because it's very difficult to have something completely carbon neutral straight away but there's there's things that you can do think of today as a clean sheet of paper you know all of the solutions that are needed at least a vast majority but probably all of them that are needed to really fix climate change within the time frames required already exist you know and and the situation we're in is such a fragile one because there isn't much time you know this is on our watch you know this is on our watch everybody now available today it's not i've got young kids it's not on their watch and the solutions um you know are within our reach you know all people need to do is just deliver and get on with it we did a few people say oh you know oh grid server who are you you know they don't say that anymore um and uh are you really gonna build that yeah um and we have you know but but it really is just the beginning of the journey because i thought the same oh there's a fancy render of something that will never get built and nice idea and everything then got there and i was oh my god there's people that want it as well on a grand scale because as a little manufacturer we couldn't build something that you know but we know that that's what's needed and batteries are needed for us to have this whole and it is it's industry working together and then politicians policy makers regulators not holding back on innovation listen to us the politicians we need to help them help us make the right choices so up in northumberland we've got 93 actors we're we're digging the ground up you would say okay well why are you putting it up there why don't you put in the in the middle of the country for logistic reasons and the reason why british folk put it there is that there's the north sea interconnect to come from norway so completely renewable electricity coming into that national grid area you've got the wind farms over there so it's possible to have an entire battery factor 93 hectares in renewable energy powered completely so the low carbon battery is a reality and then if you make all the recycled materials within the factory and the batteries recyclable then it the embedded carbon comes down and down and down to almost a negligible level and politicians need to understand that so my message to to the the people at cop is know about this stuff understand it because it's all new and it's all new technology and some of them need to drive electric cars and charge them as we have done all those duty cycles thousands and thousands of miles then you'll understand how wonderful this transition is going to be what you would to see come out of cop26 i mean what you would to them to say um yeah just a little bit more urgency i'm going to go with the greta sunburg effect because you know enough empty words let's actually take some action now because i feel everyone can say the right things and you know for the for the cameras or whatever no it's done with all the fluffy stuff let's actually see some solid action because we are running out of time it's as simple as that that is important yeah i think tonight i mean i assume you're much in alignment with that yeah get on with it i think absolutely yeah and but i've been attending a lot of these you know the first cop i went to was a cop um you know cop 14 in 2008 before copenhagen was pope poznan and then copenhagen and you know there's a lot of people making promises and a lot of words and a lot of this and a lot of that and um an action is absolutely essential but for me what i just want to come out of it is people go you know what we're actually going to do this you know a bit when you know the conservative you know government theresa may they change the legislation from we're going to reduce emissions by x percent by this excluding shipping excluding that by this arbitrary date and time it was what what does that mean you know to suddenly net zero by this date and by the way we're going to try and do it a lot earlier you know and if something can come out of government you know come out of cop with just the world coming together and going you know what we're not going to play around the edges we're going to do this you know there's companies grid sir my energy you know british vote and others that are just going to rise to the occasion i mean all we really need is clarity and certainty and on that basis we will make it happen the government needs to understand that the opportunities here this is the biggest commercial opportunity for this country since oil coal the railways the industrial revolution all that sort of stuff and if you think batteries for evs will enable us to have batteries for aviation for maritime and for static energy storage for towns and cities and it will change the world batteries will change the world and i don't think they get that and they've got to grab this and there's a tearing urgency to it but you know there's technology within the homes as well you know there's millions and millions of homes they're little energy consumption microgrids essentially and it's how the whole system works together and balances and supports the network everybody says the grid will melt if you plug in evs technology or it is it exists you know it's what we do it's about balance the home it's balanced the grid you know i think government and people need to understand and listen to innovators within the industry i just think we need to focus on solutions whatever they are that are as affordable as possible ideally less expensive than polluting alternatives electric vehicles you know the life cycle cost of electric vehicles is less than petrol and diesel now as is renewable energy um and ones that can just be deployed now there's lots of distraction technologies out there that people get very excited about um but you know i just say look you know is it you know is this something which is commercially viable not not in 20 30 40 years but within the time frames required to address climate change is it and is it something that people are actually going to do because it can be deployed quick enough it works and it's economically viable ideally socially environmentally as well and if it is let's focus on that stuff you know and let's give that probably more than 80 of the focus um and i just do get a bit concerned that there's other technology in the periphery that sound great and people get quite excited about but are a bit of a distraction to the biggest problem we've got which is addressing climate change and i do think i mean the longer we've been using this quite you know initially quite naff term stop burning stuff you know because it's ridiculous and we know we can't possibly stop burning everything but that's quite a good guide because you think wait a minute can you do that does that need to be do you need to burn stuff to do what you're going to do and if you if you don't you think well that's probably a fairly good guide that it's going to be cheaper in the long run it's going to be better in the longer it's going to be lower carbon and you know that as a sort of guiding principle is kind of held solid for the last 10 years i don't think people are very conscious about how much stuff we burn you know if you said somebody how much stuff did you burn today most people said i didn't burn anything did you go for a ride in your car yeah yeah but actually you did in the middle of your car it's something that just burnt you know 300 million year old dinosaur kind of juice and uh you know they're just not really aware of that yeah and uh obviously not doing that is helpful and the reason we solar energy so much is that the energy you know that people are burning today is actually stored sunlight from hundreds of millions of years ago that's what it was you know plants absorb through photosynthesis sun energy you know some of that stayed as plants and they got eaten by animals it all got compressed eventually you end up with fossil fuels but we know now that um that there's you know consequences of extracting all of that and burning it um whereas if you can just absorb that energy directly that turns up every day you know you can look up rather than looking down is another kind of way of looking at it just look up you know it's another it's another thought there's a solution out here somewhere where is it you know i'm sure there's a solution then um you know then then we have everything we need unfortunately it's now less expensive to use free sun energy because there is already a fission reactor in the sky you know um that we don't have to yeah that works burning it is burning it's a long way away there's a floor in the plan [music] now when it comes to technologies that eliminate emissions electric cars are often the poster child and the great thing about pure electric vehicles is there are no emissions at the tailpipe because there is no tailpipe what's more whether it's by opting for a clean electricity supply or generating your own power with solar panels unlike their combustion engine counterparts electric cars actually allow for the possibility that you do not need to rely on fossil fuel power plants and we are not simply moving the tailpipe elsewhere but what about embodied emissions the emissions that are released to manufacture the car in the first place well it is possible to clean that process up too and several car makers are seriously making a difference none more so than pole style so let's talk to frederica claren from polstar about their pioneering approach so frederica can you tell us about polstar's objectives when it comes to net zero sure we we've learned a lot during our product development and we use lifecycle assessment to estimate the climate impact of the choices that we're making and when we did that for pulse r2 we so clearly saw that electric vehicles offer us a route to climate neutral mobility and even though they are not 100 clean in any way we want to be transparent with that they come with a footprint they are a climate solution already today so if you choose a pulsed r2 and you charge it with renewable energy you can have the climate impact than if you would have chosen a petrol car so they have an amazing impact already today that we we need to tap into but we also saw that we can go for full decarbonisation so as a company we want to become climate neutral by 2040 and that gives us good margin until 2050 when we know as a world we need to reach net zero emissions but we also want to talk about the fact that we need to see a decrease in emissions now we need to bend the curve now and we have this decade the climate decay to really find solutions and start implementing them as soon as possible so we wanted to create this sense of urgency that we in the industry and we internally at post our need to do more we need to to take this climate solution that is are early today and make them even better so we decided to launch a moonshot goal to create a climate neutral car by 2030 we call it the post of zero projects so how does that extend to the materials you use and under under manufacturing process as well and are you thinking about how you can recycle those materials at the end of life uh well it that is where the the big impacts lie so in our life cycle assessment again we so clearly see where the impact the climate impact stems from and it it's the battery going into the car it's the steel and the aluminium that has the highest impact when you look at post r2 so of course we focus a lot on those three areas we need to secure renewable energy for the production of metals and minerals we need to secure a high degree of circularity so looking at recycled content but also reuse of parts for example so renewable energy and circularity will be solutions that we tap into to really secure that we that we get down to climate neutrality on the components and the materials in the car and what would you to see from our political leaders at cop26 we at pole start believe that we are stuck in some somewhat of a climate echo chamber so we hear a lot of great commitments from business leaders and and and policy makers uh which we applaud it's great that everyone is finally setting net zero targets uh but actually when we when we scrutinize those targets we see that they are simply not enough it will not take us on this pathway uh where we actually don't increase the temperature temperature above one and a half degree so at cop26 we really want to inspire others with what we do in setting bold bold targets and and having clear actions postdoc hero and we also want to talk about the fact that we need to become more transparent in what we do we cannot just blurt out a a target or a commitment or goal we actually have to secure now that our stakeholders our consumers investors everyone that should be along for this ride that they know what we do and how we progress and that is also why we have decided to publish the carbon footprint of of all of our cars we have something that we call a product sustainability declaration where you will see the carbon footprint for all of our cars from pulse r2 leading up to pulsar zero and when we deliver post or zero it will clearly state a zero ton co2 on the product sustainability declaration we love futuristic technologies from solid state batteries to renewable hydrogen and from electric flight to nuclear fusion but we have to accept that at the moment these technologies are not ready to deploy at scale and there are some red herrings out there from blue fossil hydrogen to carbon capture and storage that threaten to distract us from what we really need to do in the here and now so here is the fully charged list of today technologies the technologies we need to focus on rolling out now let's start with electric cars while we believe the world needs more public transport and fewer cars we're clear that those that are on the road should be all electric we really see a need to stress how important the transition in the energy system is to support the electrification of transport we need to charge these vehicles with renewable energy that is as i said earlier when we see this amazing impact in having the emissions and of course once you own an electric car your focus is going to switch to how you charge it and the energy that you need to do that the amazing thing about charging your ev at home is that you can do it in so many different ways you can do it super cost effective you can do it green you can do it for potentially free if you've got solar panels and that is smog when you're driving around on sunshine and what about if you can't charge an electric car or if you're a high mileage user i would say the charging infrastructure in the uk is improving we as an example have have now in the last 100 days completed the upgrade of over a hundred sites in the most strategic locations across the motorway network and that's made a massive difference we know that because we're charging over 50 000 vehicles every month um we're putting over you know enough energy to drive five million miles an electric vehicle every month um so people are using it it's working and in addition to that we're building electric forecourts which you know really give people the absolute confidence whether they can or they can't charge at home to charge in location it's not just about electric cars of course there is an array of commercial vehicles vans and trucks to consider the migration of commercial vehicles to electrification is an enormous opportunity for society we know that commercial vehicles today contribute a disproportionate amount of co2 to the atmosphere so a very quick and seamless migration to electric vehicles needs to happen as soon as possible and not forgetting smaller electric vehicles too what's exciting thing about electric cars for me is the challenge of getting the weight out of them um weight is obviously a killer for for everything from a dynamics point of view from a load carrying capability from a strain on our infrastructure and wear and tear on our roads for example and for me it's about efficiency doing more with less is essentially what we're trying to do we've obviously producing a vehicle that can go into the city centre even when it's been pedestrianized even when it the urbanization and the ul's ed zones eddie's ed zones are coming into force that different sort of micro mobility uh highway that we're starting to see crop up not just in the uk but across across europe as well our vehicles fit and work in that scenario whether the car is electrified or or um or banned you need a vehicle to get into that city centre to deliver goods and that's what we believe we've produced solar is one of the critical technologies at grid scale and at domestic level we've got to a point now not only is it you know competitive with fossil fuels but it's actually less expensive and that's meant that we can now deliver you know really large solar farms we actually is in grid serve delivered the first really large solar farms in the uk without the requirement for any subsidies at all um and that's essential because we need you know not just for people to transition to electric vehicles but in such a way that all the energy that's being consumed is is is you know either zero carbon if you're putting energy directly into an electric vehicle um or net zero carbon i can see solar growing in the uk i mean we see it first hand um people that buy electric vehicles tend to start looking at solar panels pretty quickly because i think how can i charge this the greenest and cheapest way possible and it's also people that already own solar panels start thinking i'm going to get an electric car and what we've seen is the industry sort of off the to hold onto the tiger's tail of ev and i can see solar you know becoming more and more popular especially as the price of technology has come down and when you've got smart technology within the home the return on investment's a lot quicker so it really it still stacks up and if solar panels aren't an option for your building there are energy supplies that can supply you with sustainable energy so what's amazing about wind power is that it's really cheap it's really readily available it doesn't use fossil fuels there's no burning there's no gas there's no coal and it's here on our doorstep we've got so much of it um and it's already generating more than 20 of the uk's electricity and there's so much more to do so if we look at how energy is generated today you've got large-scale power stations uh typically a large-scale gas at the moment then we have a lot of offshore wind and that will start to to to become very distributed and we're going to see a lot more wind generation being put up and we're going to see a lot more solar generation being put up so what ripple does is we enable individual households to own a tiny part of a large-scale wind farm at the moment they're onshore but we're also looking at offshore projects as well and then those households can get the low-cost green electricity that's produced by their wind farm supply to their home via the grid and then they get savings off their electricity bill every month so it's an easy way for everyone to own their own source of clean green low cost power and of course whether it's for storing solar energy or for use in your electric car the battery is an absolutely critical component in the switch away from combustion there will be no energy transition without batteries so if we're going to create all this renewable electricity we need to store it somewhere and currently we just don't have the capacity to do that which is why the national grid just you know gives it away and you can get it really cheaply to to power your electric car but if we don't have batteries to store all this electricity we will not be able to do what our ambitions are which to to just burn less and have cleaner air so batteries are absolutely critical when it comes to homes and buildings heat and hot water remains a huge challenge but the technologies do exist the objective with a heat pump is to encourage customers to move from being fossil fuel based heating gas towards electric heating now a heat pump has a coefficient performance of about three what that means is for every kilowatt energy electricity you put into it you get about the equivalent of three kilowatts of heating out of it that starts to make electricity consumption or the cost of electricity for a heat pump fairly similar to gas and we'll see that changing hope as the government takes on board the messages we're giving them that we should move green levels from electricity to gas that means we can get homes to electric heating and reduce the fossil fuel generation on the on the uk fossil consumption and encourage customers to go green what excites me most about grousel's heat pumps is technology i think is that they're the closest replacement to what we now understand as a domestic boiler but it's completely clean you you can have heat in your home when you want it without burning stuff totally sustainable and you know it can run at the temperatures that you're used to that would normally heat your home and you can have a very very comfortable a very easily managed easy to control home where let's face it most people don't unlike me most people don't get excited about heating their home part of the transition by 2050 we need to decarbonize the uk and it's all right to think about building new homes building low carbon homes but 80 percent of homes that exist today will still exist in 2050 and we need to decarbonize those and of great concern is is social housing there are thousands of people that that are in fuel poverty and one of the great things about heat pumps is it enables us to retrofit whole tower blocks at a time so the core 364 project we replaced 364 gas boilers across a number of tower blocks and we leave the the consumer we leave the tenant in a much better position they have a better heating system they can control it better they feel more comfortable and they're saving money so really it's win-win for for all of the parties and if a heat pump isn't for you perhaps one of these technologies is yeah well the electrification of heat is hugely exciting it's been the elephant in the room for decades um heat pumps are brilliant brilliant technology really exciting i think our view is that there are lots of homes for which a heat pump is just not going to be the answer and there are lots of reasons for that it's cost and space and other things um and unless people get serious about the practical challenges of these things we're just not going to get the change in the pace of change for heating that we need and so what we've developed with our with our zeb was zero emission boiler is a plug and play replacement for a boiler um that does the same thing but doesn't have all this the disruption associated with the heat pump and we think that makes it a really good candidate for driving rapid change in this market we are a british-based startup we are we're manufacturing here in the uk and you know we are early stage but we've had enormous enormous uh excitement from from people all across the country actually a lot of a lot of people up in scotland but all the way down to cornwall and that's because people are desperate to have a solution to decarbonize their home uh to quickly and more affordably than than some of the other options out there um and the fact that we're we're making them here in britain is obviously brilliant and i think you know british engineering british innovation british ingenuity is is needed now more than ever cop 26 is a once in a generation opportunity for us to actually make a change we keep having all these meetings and things and the trajectory has been the same there's no visible slowdown in the burning of fossil fuels um it needs to change more quickly heat pumps are brilliant technology but they don't always fit every property so let's look at what you do with apartments or properties where you can't put an air source heat pump in the garden there are other technologies such as infrared so there's a company next-gen that makes infrared wallpaper it's literally wallpaper you put it on the wall and and it is powered off 50 volts ac and it emits infrared from a graphene layer and that feels the heat from the sun if you if you're standing outside and the cloud goes over you can feel the change in temperature from from that sunlight that's infrared and that's what nextgen are doing and if you need to store heat there are some fantastic thermal storage options too hot water is critical for grid flexibility the reason is that throughout the uk there's an enormous storage potential within existing hot water cylinders installed in homes throughout the country and something 10 times the capacity of dinorwig is there in terms of flexibility to absorb surplus winds surplus solar energy and with increasing rollouts of heat pumps we're going to see more and more hot water storage and so it's going to be critical that that's intelligent and flexible so that we can fit the power demand that we're going to see growing at the right times than our existing infrastructure and let's not forget that we can do more simply by using less energy efficiency is under-appreciated whether it's insulation or smart thermostats there are affordable things we can do today so here's a rapid reminder of the technologies that we recommend [music] so [music] so as mundane as it sounds what the world needs is less talking there's work to be done and action is needed across the political spectrum to deploy these technologies and that's especially the case because some of them are not accessible to everyone yet what we need is for our leaders to show real leadership and start legislating for and planning for these technologies because that is what's going to make them affordable for everybody so keep watching fully charged which covers all these topics electric vehicles and clean technology and tell your friends family anyone you meet and share this episode as widely as you can and have a look at our stop burning stuff manifesto what happens next is up to us do [music] you,0
Bjorn Nyland,PLqKx2qnB8Xv4rFsIsmw2e1jhYNT-Dux6Z,xJa2CKhSMDY,"this was brought to you by marcus be elmech a planner stone b camp power and b component yo what's up we're now home and we getting ready for a one wait a 500 km challenge so you see a bmv i3 this is 2016 model so it's 7 years old and it's from elmech yeah thumbs up to them for lending with the car so it's a new test because with these old cars with small batteries it doesn't makes sense to do 1,000 km challenge it's totally irrelevant anyway but 500 km might be relevant that's we're going to test uh so they will follow the same rule as the 1,000 k challenges except for that we have to set some criterias i'm not sure which one yet but at least i say it should be 5 years old and maybe have less than 50 kw battery and maybe initially cost less than 500k nuke or or 50k euros maybe we'll see but okay so uh it's a bit dirty sorry for that it might be even dirtier once be finished so yeah you guys know the i3 highly impractical doors yeah i have to buckle up otherwise it would just dong at me yeah okay so you see we start with 100% battery and wait no no how is this again um the bc the board computer okay um i have to reset some stuff here where do i see ad look look at that yeah this car has some driving 174,000 km it has some degradation also you see here this is electrified app and initially it had 60 amp hour it reports now at 50.9 yeah i i could also go in here and check the butt copper max i'll probably test that in the uh degradation test but already based on this number here it could seem we have roughly 15% degradation so instead of having the the 19 kw hour initially we have maybe around 15 kilow hour now 15 or 16 i'm not sure but yeah so um um the one yeah the keep so the 500 km challenge will be slightly different we will start from yes him we will drive now down to the german sorry the the swedish border to v and then turn around and then drive all the way north to uh uh rda and then head back and then we will finish 1,000 right before yeser him so that's a 500 i mean 500 so that's a quite simple route so other than that uh it will be more or less the same as the regular 1,000 km challenge so we will of course check when we start it's 422 right now so let's do all the preparation and then off we go all right we on the move now we started at 4:30 but uh uh this is weird it's fogging huh what i i thought korean cars would fog not uh german cars okay whatever but you see that we already down dude we've been driving for 5 minutes and we already down to 92% so i don't know how fast i should be driving because if you drive too fast the battery runs out faster and you will have to charge every uh uh uh 50 km yeah maybe i should slow down a bit yeah maybe actually but so uh you know i can't just hammer it a regular 1,000 km challenge with newer cars but what the heck is going on with the fogging hair what is it outto okay it wasn't on outto oh that's weird okay now a small mistake yeah i thought when you press out to that out to ref fogging would also uh be enabled but okay i was wrong there so hopefully it clears up now so yeah well okay i need to slow down a little bit for bow we will of course apply regular uh uh regular deductions just 1,000 k challenge also so yeah next toop is unknown for now but fortunately in norway route we have plenty of [music] chargers [music] all right we are now down to uh 11.6% left and we have 8 k of range left and already when the car warned me about low battery at uh 19 km range left i felt um the cabin comfort uh meaning heat was slightly reduced so yeah i don't want to drive too fast we just hit the 100 z so i'm actually going at 100 on the speed though h this is the name of the game when we have these old classic cars is that you can't drive too fast um but we're going to stop now at shell o exit is coming up soon but hopefully i can make it there hopefully the car doesn't die before zero kilm oh but yeah when it comes to the moisture i figured out what the problem was i had it quite moist in the garage because i tried to uh melt all the snow and also uh evaporate evaporate everything that's why i had 18° cel in the garage and 66% relative humidity that's why so we had quite a big uh chunk of uh moisture in the car but the car is doing a good job of clearing it out now so yeah okay there's i see shell over there uh i have 5 km range left i'm not sure if i dare to hammer it but there there the rolling into the uh fast charger now all right we're charging now getting huh 26 kw wait why are we getting 26 kow you see there why are we not getting 45 kw uh only 75 um huh what let's move 26 huh what the hell heck is wrong here all right i moved let's see now start wrapping up update a bit slow this app or i'm not sure yeah probably this app okay we're back to 26 kw battery is not crazy cold or hot or anything uh at 24° we should yeah okay okay we need to duct a couple of minutes it was probably fault the charger yeah uh always blame charger abb you see over there that's the one we use yeah so now it's better now it's way better so we just deduct around 2 minutes because of this i think in the future i might want to use high power chargers instead and you see uh bmv uh they have something called auxiliary climate yeah uh because that's how it was from the fossil world uh but in order to get heat you have to activate this if you just fire up the car uh you will not get any heating power uh but the auxiliary climate might not work at low st of charge i when i tried it initially with 5% it's said now to low st of charge even though we are connected to high power charger so let's see now then activate and see oh oh it seems to be working oh yeah oh yeah the heat is on w look at this we at 70% and we already down to 24 kilow it started throttling already around 50% so it seems these old degraded i3 batteries at least the first generation here they don't charge that fast i was expecting 45 kilowatt until 70 75% but that's not going to happen so uh it feel i mean i feel even the eolf battery is charging faster now because eolf could maintain 40 something kilowatt until 70% so wow okay but uh we are almost done now yeah uh at this point we don't want to camp here too long so the next stop is going to be suly uh well this map is clumsy man this tiny screen but yeah next stop is going to be 47 km away you can see so far uh the consumption and such yeah i also measure that we have spot on distance yeah there is no uh measurement error distance [music] here [music] oh yeah we're jing now we arrived with four kilomet left this is the name of the game but then see what are we getting now uh okay okay we get yeah you see yeah that's good 125 amp 44 kow something but the temperature in the battery didn't drop that much h wow this is so weird because over here it's + 3.5 de c when we started from yer him it was - 8 or something so this is the the the advertised heat uh wave that is coming it's weird because it's uh 15th of december what is it 15 or no it's 16th of december now and it's supposed to be cold right but wow okay so you see that over here the stuff has started to melt so this is good because this car is equipped with heat pump so in these temperatures the heat pump will be very efficient but yeah the consumption was a bit high now because we had headwind we have wind from the south now so but now soon we will turn around and then head north yeah i use this cam power and recharge because uh actually i just remember that i could have used super charger over there or even m charger but they a little bit dark i prefer it here so yeah and also it's fairly quick um i don't need to fill up that many kilowatt hours so in that regard uh it doesn't matter that de these ones are a bit expensive compared to supercharger because the mind is with supercharger is that it's somewhat slow sometimes to connect with the app and and then if it bugs then have to move whatever so we we just go for this one for now yeah look here we are now at 60% and we are down to 35 kw so it throttles earlier than eagles h interesting i wonder if it's always this or if this i3 battery has degraded in charging speed also over time [music] we are now at the turn around point this is the schw soon and now we getting yeah okay see it yeah i i activated the auxiliary heater but we are still getting 43 kow oh yeah this time i arriv with 20% that's fine i was hammering it but now at least we shouldn't have too crazy headwind what actually do we have okay whatever so yeah rinse and repeat um yeah but this time i noticed that the battery temperature dropped uh to 28° okay okay whatever um we're just taking uh just checking it that it doesn't go crazy high but it seems to be able to maintain the this temperature it doesn't go sky high so that's good good and food for today is salad homemade salad yeah remember to abc always bring salad and remember that this is the the only thing i eat yeah even if i'm home i'm only eating salad 24/7 yeah m we are getting close to i and we have 8 kilm of range left oh and we are 7 km away oh um okay i have to slow down a bit uh i was hammering it uh earlier but that seems to punish me now okay so now i know roughly the ballpark how fast i should drive um yeah okay let's hope we can make it there what the heck is going to happen if we run out of juice uh no i can always drive slow wait wait wait wait wait maybe i can use let see eco pro or ecco pro plus yeah oh now we have 10 km of range yeah i forgot to tell you this car has no auto ster it doesn't even have adaptive cruise control wait does it have blinker it has blinker at least okay that's good it has the blinker package but yeah just you know this car is roughly as old as classic ionic but you can imagine you know how awesome classic ionic was back then people didn't know because classic aic was cheaper than this i3 and the classic aic even had a bigger battery it was more efficient it chargers faster it has ventilated seats and auto steer is and adaptive cruise control what did you get in the i3 back then oh the bmv badge we are now at i r getting 44 kilow wait h what it was at 125 am initially now it dropped okay so um now we wait over here is 2.5 de c that means it's going to get colder as we move up now but um right now i can't fire up the heater yet because the st charge is too low so wait a couple of minutes and then you fire up but uh there another thing is that this car is limited to 125 amp well actually what the he oh cooling is running now so now we just wait average driving stop is around 15 minutes long 15 to 20 minutes long but it's just that you have to charge you have to charge for 15 minutes and then you drive for half an hour uh okay we've been charging for 17 minutes at 69% we're taking well into the batter at 25 kilow so it's time to leave [music] [applause] [music] okay yet another jing stop we are actually back at shell o where we started with the first stop so um yeah you know huh we have some ac over here maybe i should do this challenge with the classic soy but it cannot be the 52 kw hour soy it must be the 40 yeah but the problem is that in norway um there will be less and less ac spots these are just dc uh so that's going to be a good challenge man but okay rinse and repeats this time i'm going to go to the gas station and maybe buy some buns they were quite good good smelling buttons over here oh yeah i went for shell bowet oh look at this oh man six so them okay okay okay let me see let's try some huh you guys guys [music] ready m m m it's a nice [music] bun [music] yeah we're charging same story but but on on the other hand it seems to be somewhat random hey did you hear that i think that's thermal expansion of the battery pack i heard it before it's not unique with tesla i also heard this in other non teslas the dunk it's probably because the battery is heating up now but okay so we came here with 7% nothing new uh but yeah i was going to show you that sometimes i get 122 23 amps sometimes i get only 110 amps so uh is that because of charger is is the car being moody uh i don't know but yeah so it's now we are past the halfway mark and it's 8 yeah it's almost 9 in the morning oh man but it's foggy so it's great that this challenge is not too long now we have headwind but i think i missed park i did a a a bad bmv typical bm parking was i'm i'm used to that being supposed to back up into the charger well apparently here you're supposed to oh let me adjust you're supposed to park this or actually no no no this car has a charge port on the right side with the wrong side should have been left side with the right side so then i have to park with an face this side yeah so that's clumsy i could have used one of these but i feel uh i'm taking up a high power charger for no reason yeah these are 300 kow but then i realized that this charger which seems to be a 50 kow charger it's actually not it's 180 kow charger so all [music] right we are now at ne and this is strange because before we arrived here the windows start fogging and then i noticed that it's minus 7° over here the temperature has been all over the place we had plus 4.5 de at some point and then minus 7 over here yeah okay so yeah um same story here but now i'm at the supercharger so i plugged in oh i realized i used the wrong stall yeah it is an indication that you use the wrong toall because um i can show you um at least if you can see the the stall number i should have used that stall you see yeah 12b and another problem is that there is no privacy because when you're sitting there you're looking straight into the other guys in the tesla you see i've been telling you that the charge port needs to be on the left side because the left side is a right [music] side we are now at c k in lon uh there are so many charges here we have m cem power over there we have supercharg we have whatever uh tesla is also planning on establishing supercharger here but uh yeah i just use the c k because i'm lazy uh and also be are just putting in small amounts every time around 10 12 kilow hour but yeah so the consumption has been better now you see that see the see the flag we are going that direction we get nice tailwind right now oh yeah so um let me see if can i go to m oh yeah it has the ey drive holy crap man nav go to not yeah see the next wow this screen is tiny can i zoom in no no other way other way yeah we are going here that's the end point so from here to r is 45 km so if we charge around 75% then we should be able to make it it's just that every time we reach around 75% it charges dog slow takes around 20 kow uh well okay whatever i'm going to show you now so uh i didn't bring a fridge with me i didn't bring up cooler box because if you want to cool down this uh uh coca-cola all i need to do is just place it here and that's a natural cooler box right there [music] huh we are now at the super charger or actually it's not only super charger but we are now at the rs hugd where we have super charger and a bunch of other chargers but you see um whenever you see brothers with the charge port on the wrong side you to cluster with them because two wrongs make it right okay anyway uh first i was oh yeah since i'm here and it's saturday not sunday i could get some fresh donuts except for that the fresh donut shop is closed oh no okay well okay no fresh donuts then yeah uh then i just sit around here it's cold over here it's minus 6 or some o um so not much else to do i can show you maybe on the map here well actually can we see it on the map the map is kind of clumsy i always do this yeah um yeah i activated auxiliary um now let's see if you go to nov okay here can i can i show you i have to zoom in a bit well that's out oh the other way around there you see that uh the next charger is going to be uno x here at quter is called funny name yeah that's only 25 km away if you want to go the the other way and the next one possible would be the same one we came from 45 km away that's almost too far away since we have headwind on the way back now so um i think the best deal is just to drive 25 km charge at uno x and then charge one more time and then we done yeah so uh so far so good huh okay the car did not rapid gate at least i couldn't see it uh so that's good it was performing very uh consistently and i just noticed i haven't seen oh the car shows you state of health 84% o that means 16% degradation is that how you count it [music] h we are now at ex qu rout uh charging up for the first time for me at least on hypercharger but you see what's cool about this hypercharger is that the uno x they equip them with tapping you can pay with card you don't need to have be a member you don't need to have an app or anything you can just press credit card and then you also the price here 4.5 new per kilowatt hour that's cheaper than uh c k and recharge and made and so it's a very nice price and this is not some kind of membership price just tap it here uh also oh are you deuts yeah deuts well okay you have to do well they forgot to translate this part oh okay yeah uh you need to fix this if this is in deuts then this also needs to be in deuts well can you change language here seems to be only the vision here you need to fix that okay other than that though yeah okay up production i don't know what you mean okay whatever so yeah um we need to charge one more time and then we're [music] done uh we now at esa and you can you know you can even see the the local you can see the wind now we have we're going we're going that direction we had some massive headwind the consumption was 280 wat hour per kilm so i have two choices i can stay here until 80% and then i can have to go uh around 45 km or i can hammer it and drive only 20 km to uh the next charger i think that's what i'm going to do we're going to we're going to charge fast and then hammer it that's also safer otherwise i might run out of juice i have to drive dog slow and that's not an option so yeah uh that means uh not this one but one more charging stop over here we have c power yeah i'm even too lazy to go out now because it's uh freaking cold outside we're almost at minon now uh the wind sock well this one is not that erected but we have some significant wind and look at the consumption 299 wat hour per kilm what the heck man this this beaver no no i mean this this this hamster has a drag coefficient of 29 oh okay but we're going to pull out over here yes and charge one more time then right last charger stop well the battery somehow magically cools down every time now you see okay anyway um i figured out that we are roughly 35 km away from home and we need to drive another uh 30 something km for 999 so yeah that's great this is the first time i do it 500 km challenge we 9 on the line roughly 5 km away from my home then me go straight there if it's just 5 km i don't care too much about uh the du thing extra time for getting 5 km range it might take a minute right so all right and then over here you see you see how it is so k they want to taunt you no they won they wanton they only put uh well i was about to say they only put un healthy food here but there there are some healthy options except for that all of this contains lots of carbs uh wait do we have any vegan option here che cheese is not vegan so okay but man it's wind it's not that cold anymore but it's just windy which makes it cold let's finish this and then i can go straight home i want to charge now for the last time i don't know how many times i tred i lost count but i just want to unplug soon and then go straight into my heated garage yeah there is it the final run oh what what the heck okay there you go yeah there some sms fast on the wind screen yes hammer it hammer it for the last few kilometers now all right let's do the countdown 99 wait no 4992 4993 4994 4995 4996 4997 4998 4999 500 the first 500 kilm challenge consumption 243 time uh 1240 we have to deduct four hours and 20 and 4 hours and 32 minutes so it's 8 hours and 8 minutes which becomes 8 hours and 10 minutes oh how was it with the um with the hamster well it did it well but actually i was a bit disappointed that the charging speed was not that great even the eagles was better so there are follow-up videos i want to make for example i hammered it and i charged and hammer it was it a good idea so if i have time now i will try to redo it already and then drive slower and then charge to maybe 75 80% and we will see if that's faster yeah and also if i have time and opportunity i will borrow the eolf again from elmech and test if the eolf can actually beat the beaver and also the the classic ionic i already returned it to muchus i'm not sure if he took off the sticker but he hasn't sold it yet so it's not too late we can get the ionic back just one last challenge we need to show how awesome the ionic is this beaver sorry this hamster did it in over 8 hours i believe the classic ioni can do it in 6 hours maybe even faster but we need to prove it we need to prove how awesome the classic ionic is but i didn't make the challenge only to prove how awesome my own is it's just a new challenge that we work in these classic cars so maybe you guys have some ideas what other classic cars should we fit into the 500 k challenge yeah anyway i think that's going to be it for now i hope you guys enjoy this as always thank you for watching and talk to you later",4
Bjorn Nyland,PLqKx2qnB8Xv4rFsIsmw2e1jhYNT-Dux6Z,zlOwFqUeE5E,"this was brought to you by marcus be elmech a planner stone b camp power and b component yo what's up you guys probably saw the previous uh round of 500 k challenge with uh i3 and i think i'm going to redo it i worked out i did some calculation and you saw in the previous that u we spent actually 3 hours and 20 minutes total in the charting stops and yeah okay we drove fast but i suspect that uh uh for this kind of setup or these old cars it pays off to drive a little bit slower because the overhead became quite big and also uh the i3 just happened to be somewhat inefficient once you start hammering it because of poor air dynamics so according to my calculation if we redo it now driving a little bit slower we could be half an hour to maybe 1 hour faster than before last time it was 8 hours and 5 minutes so let's see can we do it in 7 and 1/2 half by going slower this is highly scientific this is very useful test and information for you guys who buy an old car should you hammer it and charge faster i tend to do with modern cars or should you actually take it slower with these cars let's find out i'm going to do a final preparation and then we will start uh yeah right around midnight a little bit past midnight right we on the move and we already down to 76% no but you see the idea this time is that we'll be cruising at maximum 100 110 km/ hour in the speed though of course when we pass through the city we have to go slower but uh the gps speed now is around 107 km/ hour so yeah uh i don't want to go at 90 something because then it will take awfully long time to travel uh so i think this might be a good balance between travel speed versus efficiency and all that so yeah it still fogs a bit now because it had high moisture from the garage but it should clear up soon so it's not the car's fault it's the actually the gage [applause] [music] [applause] vault right we're now at west b first starting stop so actually we went um how much is this went around 10 km further south before we stopped for the first time pre versus the previous run so already now i feel we are slightly faster except for that we might have driven slightly slower but we'll see by the end of the trip if this help or not but okay so over here we have super chargers yeah i'm plugging in on the wrong side you see if you can yeah you see whatever whatever at night it doesn't matter because we have plenty of stalls here there's even a fat ron also plugg in in the wrong side but whatever whatever the germans they just want to do it their own way so um yeah let me show you inside the plan now oh look at this we're getting 60 46 kilowatt yeah 124 amp this time i also don't want to run the heater yet uh we might not need to because it's not that cool outside wait what was temperature now you can't see outside temperature you have to fire up the car over there so uh i will show you on google map this time that the next stop is going to be the turn around point at the sp soon and that is uh 72 kilm away so uh this time also um this challenge we will charge probably to 70 75% every time past 75% it goes uh painfully slow so yeah uh we just have to charge enough now and drive slow enough to reach next point okay so the plan is that we charge to around 70 75% every time and then um well first i want to go to the turn on point but i realized it's too far away but at least we can go 52 km now over to arnd and charge there so yeah a couple more minutes and also yeah i also start preheating roughly i don't know a couple of minutes before departure so we start getting some heat in here but um last time i also suspected that the battery was slightly rapid gating because i stole the heat pump for heating the cabin instead of cooling the [applause] battery [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] we are now charging at uh salsburg this is what it's i think it's called alin so i'm now taking the 50 kow i had to deduct 4 minutes because um first i tried this side do you know these abs they are so buggy try this side uh it seems to have started i saw stay of charge in the screen and then it stopped and then i without moving the car i just grabbed the other side here plug it in same thing happened it seems to start charging and then the and then stopped oh then they move over so we have 4 minute deduction so man these av chargers they are so unreliable uh so you can't play the car for it that's why we deduct 4 minutes but at least now we're getting 125 amp yeah i also tend to want to avoid these old charges because some of them they might have broken modules uh so they might not give me 125 amp or 45 something kilowatt so but at least it's working now so you know over here it's 4.5 de c wow i can almost take out my shorts my shorts so we still have wind from the south uh you see north is roughly that way yeah so this is good for this kind of challenge now is that it's nice and warm so it's a little bit warmer than previously which is an a slight advantage of course wait a minute we should be getting over 45 kilow now not i think there's something wrong with the charger let's go over at the cam power instead it's right over there we're now charging at c power and boom we get 123 amp you see it's the charger not the car some some guy in the live stream was oh maybe it's the car no no it's not the car it's the charger yeah so um always use quality chargers you see previously we had some 50 kow chargers here and recharge they've been doing this cam power spree all over norway where they take out those old 50 kw unreliable and slow charges and replace them with kem power instead so you have very smart power sharing i don't need to explain to you guys this 1 2 3 4 5 6 eight stalls and then how much power do you get here if let's say uh there's not too much traffic and you come with a fast charging car it should say here yeah yeah yeah see see ooh it even has oh it has support for 800 volt so you can take 180 kilowatt on 800 volt or 120 kow on 400 volt h wait if it has 800 volt architecture um yeah yeah it means that yeah oh this is cool i don't know you guys see it i'm using those two power modules each power module is 25 kw up to 25 kw so i'm taking up to hey this is something new i haven't seen this before wow that's [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] cool we are now charging at su uh but this is a bit weird this is v3 v2 supercharger but i'm not getting 125 amp which sounds cooling is active h uh okay whatever uh it's still okay so yeah but i need some food and uh pe stop now man one thing i don't about this location is that it's so dark here at night okay right here we just happen to have to have one light i'm not sure if this was set up by tesla or uh the gas station or owner but look here do you see them no these are near chargers delta chargers it's so dark here you know over there over at the gas station area it's lit up actually where you fill gas it's nice and bright over there but so why do we have to juice up in the darkness here but fortunately over here where i fill up last time that's the camp power s or recharge rather they have ld up area so yeah it's um why don't we have the same amenities and the same comfort as uh gas station i mean gas fillers oh i see there is a light there i don't know you can see it that is kaput oh h when not going to fix [music] it [applause] [music] we are not charging i went deep 2 km range left 4.8% left yeah we're now at shell o okay yeah wait can you hear it the cooling is active and if you look here this is is tiny but if you look at that one here oh sh 34° c in the max i heard that uh this battery doesn't to be too hot so maybe the batter is about to rapid gate because we are not getting 45 kw right now um yeah last time when i did the challenge i preheated uh this time i'm being more careful about preheating so it doesn't steal the ac unit hm [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] h we are now charging at bate and h interesting observation okay it's freaking tiny i'll show you here you see now we start with 30 31° c max previously we started with 33° max it seems the car doesn't want to be close to 34 or 33° uh previously it seems it was slightly rapid gating so yeah um this is what uh this is an interesting discovery it seems this i3 has a slight rapid gate especially if you hammer it so um my advice so far is that you want to try to avoid uh avoid going too deep try to arrive with 10% once you go lower the voltage drops the current needs to go up and internal resistance is probably higher and then you get more heat build up and then you get more rapid gate or slight rapid gate yeah okay how do you my bmv parking you see i park within the lines um well actually you know what um legally you can park this if this would be a paid place downtown because the rules in norway is that as long as the tire is on the line it's allowed as soon as the tire is outside the line that is not allowed so having fat tire is an advantage unfortunately the i3 has skinny bicycle tires 155 with so if you want to park an idiot get fat tires thick tires okay we are almost at 70% and this is the point where i want to preheat the few minutes before we leave so u initially once you stop the car you will see the option to run the auxiliary heater uh you can start the car and then dig into the menu but it's kind of clumsy if i try to open the it's it's gone so what i do is that i have pre programmed that this key here becomes the preheating key so if i press and hold you see there now the preheating starts so seems this 2 3 minutes of preheating before we leave before we unplug at 75% seems to do magic for uh uh consumption on the next leg but you will see now that it goes painfully slow now less than 20 kow towards the [music] [applause] end [music] [applause] [music] oh we are now at minon i start feeling this slight fatigue now after driving all night but we are currently at 330 km so yeah that means 170 more man but i can feel that we might be faster than before h but over here it is cold and slightly windy i'm too lazy to go outside but yeah so not much to see uh we are just charging now you see at least it's consistent yeah so not much else to comment about [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] right we are now at uno x quarter and i i the concept of uno x stations because first first of all they use hyper chargers um well one small minus is that there's no cho here but at least they have hyperchargers they they are future proof because u ccs is going to be the most common standard in europe and hyperchargers are quite reliable very few times they break down uh and also 300 kw or split 150 each uh but look here i haven't shown you guys this last time uh they have something called swan masket uh you know this this swan it's a swan uh branding or or uh approval or some um it has something to do with environmentally friendly uh stuff right products or service or whatever and this washing facility here is um it's green in a way that they reuse the water they they i don't remember i talk to uhan group about this uno x you know um they reuse the water so um there's some cleaning facility and stuff over here so you can say that washing your car makes a smaller impact on the environment yeah so you know you don't have to be green by just driving electric car you can still drive a fossil car and you can use these green washing machines here you know and i'm going to show you something else one last thing here let me see uh where do you have to walk yeah wait yeah yeah look look look at this this column is visible from the road and this is something that only uno x has they show you the price per kilowatt hour and it says that you have seven six um high power chargers ccs and the price here might change from time to time huh huh i the concept of unet man okay anyway it's quite cold over here it's amazing how the temperature can change um earlier we in the south we hit plus 4.5 de on the way here i hit - 7.5 de okay see i'm going to show you something here we are charging now at 35 kw right or um l yeah you see but if i press this button to preheat i think it's acting now now the power should go up look look it ramps up now because it it kicks in the um the heat pump so this is good design it means that the heat pump pulls extra power from the charger to start preheating the the cabin yeah bad design would be leaf or some other cars that um pull the same power from the charger uh and then you get slower speed when you want to preheat the the [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] cabin this is the second to last starting stop it's - 7° c over here yeah we're now at the ring socket uh everything looks normal yeah um and i can show you outside man it's almost 7 in the morning now and according to my calculation we will finish maybe roughly at the 8th hour mark or maybe slightly before 8 hour mark so i was hoping for a half an hour improvement but it seems it might be only around 15 20 minute improvement so far ooh okay um now we wait i've been it before by the way a couple of times just another ck charger uh charging site with lots of chargers and you can see it's cold outside here oh [applause] [music] [applause] [music] man this is it the last jing stop so if you look at the clock there um we count as if it started 17 minutes past midnight that includes 7 minute of this uh of uh some charter problems and we started 10 minutes past midnight so we are at roughly 7 hours and 20 minutes soon and we have to charge a little bit this time to 70% and then we need to drive another 40 uh 41 km so yeah we'll see i'm getting excited now this is this is a very interesting um experiment to see whether you need to go fast or slow if you have an old car i still don't know the answer yet yeah but over here it is not that cold so it's around 0° c b yeah b got b oh i think i will pass the b for now i tend to uh come here quite often so um if i would eat uh b here every time i would be a fat bastard so i prefer just being a bastard okay this is the final run yes and um um now i'm cruising at 120 km per hour previously i cruis 110 on this speedle but now we have slightly shorter legs we have to drive so that means we can go slightly faster but i don't want to go faster than this because then the the beaver becomes quite no no the the hamster becomes quite thirsty but yeah we at 7:49 so we just passed the 7 and 1/2 hour mark and we have to go 37 more kilm oh let's go let's go the sun is coming up soon so um we are now at this where is i think it was the 17th of december so in 4 days the sun will turn around and we will get brighter days well actually it's not that the earth is turning around the sun and it's spinning and tilting yeah yeah that's how it works man everything is relative actually right now we are traveling at over 10,000 kilm per hour yeah around the sun okay let's do the countdown 4992 4993 4994 45 46 49 and 7 49 and8 4999 oh 500 time 810 but we have to duct for some traffic so uh it means 7 hours and 50 minutes oh okay we r yeah 750 15 minute improve improvement now i have to get over to the fast charger super charger oh sh i'm going low slow down slow down slow down and then eco pro plus has been engaged oh ninja mode on oh man we made it here at the supercharger with 5.7% be ah 5.7 that's plenty on a tesla that's 25 km well here it is 3 km okay let's plug it in wow that a nice sunrise it's going to be uh sunny today but cold but okay so this time we were 15 minutes faster than previous iously so why was it faster um i think i have some uh explanations we consume less energy which means that we need to charge less time right uh regardless of how many charging stop we had but also we had only nine charging stop today versus 12 last time so each stop could add let's say one or two minutes of head overhead so you can say three times that but that only accounts for let's say maybe 6 minutes it's extra yeah um what does yeah losses when you hammer it i did last time there are some hidden losses uh so which means that the consumption you see on the screen that's not including all the losses so the real consumption was most likely higher uh i should try to do a test you know i did the degradation test where i drove slow i should try to test when i drive faster let's say 120 km/ hour to see how many kilowatt hour we get out i doubt that we get 16.1 it might get only 15 kw hour uh and then what else yeah so we draw slower yeah which means that the driving speed uh was uh estimated to be around 100 km/ hour versus 115 km/ hour so yeah um other than that i'm not sure uh but you know this got me thinking okay if it was if we arrived faster by driving slower would it be even better if we drove at 90 km/ hour for that one i'm not sure um then then it means that the aage speed should drop even more uh maybe to around 85 km per hour and then based on 85 you can do run the math and um i'm not sure i believe that the speed i drw today was more or less the optimal speed but uh if you hammer too hard then it goes slower because of losses and but then if you go too slow 90 km per hour then you just spend way more time d driving uh and the car is charging relatively fast so i will probably not do a third run i can just estimate it yeah but okay anyway um i think that's going to be it for now i hope you guys enjoy this as always thank you for watching and talk to you later",4
Bjorn Nyland,PLqKx2qnB8Xv4rFsIsmw2e1jhYNT-Dux6Z,Rp6kFsbdMX0,"this was brought to you by marcus be elmech a planner stone bik c power and b component yo what's up we're now in the garage and yes i want to do it i have always wanted to try this for a long time we're going to do 500 km challenge i've done 1,000 km challenge long time it was a bit cheating i run ecoflow battery heater and stuff um but uh also okay uh here's a setup i have preheated the car in the garage it's winter time but i also preheated the battery 1.5 kow heating there for about uh i don't remember 10 hours and then as a result the battery heat up heated up quite a lot it's i mean it sounds crazy but you see here we have 29 to 43° c i want it to be this hot because it seems it's not going to rapid get it's going to be minus 7° uh we will take the norway route that's the the the 500 kilm challenge it's it's safer if you take the norway route so we'll just drive south wait me see south here towards s soon turn around and then drive north to um r sector and back again and that will be 1,000 km so um we will do all the preparation now reset yeah in in the garage it was 21° c and i think we're going to start at um 1130 okay let's go all right we on the move so we started with 43 43° in the max temp um you see the battery is already cooling down wow uh so i mean why the heck did i heat up the battery with a leaf you want to avoid rapid gate right yes but the small battery here i've learned that it c gates a lot uh you rarely get it to rapid gate during winter so this is what i want to try out if you start with smoking hot battery will it then just hammer can we hammer it it without rapid gates so i chose to cruise 110 on speedo which is about a little bit over 100 km/ hour gps speed and i think that's the best balance uh between speed versus uh yeah uh efficiency and all [music] that [music] we are now charging at shell mort's road and wow initially i had 47 kw huh really um i came with a little bit too much juice around 30% but this is the only uh place for me to stop so i mean i try to heat up the battery the battery wants to be warmer than this this is crazy we are cal gating uh okay well i'll just charge for a bit and then i'll figure out my next stop but yeah so ideally what you want to do is arrive at lower state of charge because then we'll be charging faster for a bit and that will heat keep the battery heated so we can maintain flat the curve so man this is madness i preheated the battery for 10 hours in the garage an insulated garage wow um okay well um let's see what happens then and just the other cars uh it also has some fogging now but this is not something wrong with the car is just that i have quite moist uh uh air in the garage so uh eventually it will go away but yeah um show you here this location i normally don't stop here during my one ,000 k challenges because all the other cars they can reach further down there well that's a lon 6 but uh yeah so i have to stop here we have plenty of cam power uh the challenge with this challenge is that uh i have chore so i have to go for chore places so pure ionity stops or tesla doesn't work because they have ccs okay so yeah um let me see after a couple of minutes how are we oh h sh man we have down to 20 this is not good because the problem now is that uh we um we callate and we go slower and when we go slower we don't really build up heat in the battery uh i i think i have to leave soon i i mean i have to leave soon right that was uh not too long stop but um yeah you see here battery temperature 25 to 34 uh we need to hammer it i think the strategy is that we need to hammer hammer it if you slow poke the battery cools down and we call get but another problem is that the first leg is always tricky uh you can't it will always start with 100% and yeah uh and then you can't always make it go too deep also the problem is that from here in this section here between mort rout and o there is nothing yeah normally there will be 5 10 km maybe between each charting stop i mean each uh fast charger and then when i charge up next time or from now on i can estimate and i can calculate so that i try to arrive with uh 10% or 5% even well actually i'm not sure if i dare to go 5% but at least 10% arriving with 30% is already bad from the start so yeah let's see at least if the next uh charging session is better all right second charging stop and this time i went deep i went to 5% wait remaining was lower oh that was scary man good thing i okay i have to pay attention huh wait it the remaining was misreported now it say 1 kilow hour oh uh first the car reported it as uh 1.5 or something 1.2 i was ah it's still fine but yeah i be but i should look at state of charge if it says 5% then you better pay bail out oh that could have been nasty if i tried to go further uh seems maybe we have wacky bms but you see this is the trick you have to go deep because even though the battery temperature did not go up much uh during the drive here uh because we at lower state of charge uh it allows the car to charge faster and then because we are charging faster we can then build up the heat you see this is the good the good spiral but if you arrive with too much juice then it's the bad spiral so listen to uncle bj going deep makes everything better man i haven't charged here in a long time maybe it's been over over 10 almost 10 years since last time i came here and now we have chem power here there used to be some 50 kow over there a long time ago and then there's also some 50 kow over there but i i don't just i saw campire i was yeah the only problem is that you see all these stalls they are ccs only and there only two cho stalls yeah what you're looking at here is a dying race it's going extinct soon okay that was a 15-minute tury stop it went slow towards the end um yeah at least the battery heated up but it might cool down again it's the fight for the heat oh um okay so um we just r out next upop uh might be rig i'm aiming for it so the way is is that i just have to adjust my speed and my consumption yeah i should go a little bit faster uh so that we can end up at the next stop with uh low enough juice but not out of juice of course we another i'm going to show you something weird here you see we have 8.1% of charge and 1.7 1.6 kow hour eight okay 8 and 1.6 let's plug in look this happens also previously um suddenly i just lost4 kilow hour which means that this is scary man if you try to use up everything you will run out of juice so i have to count that i don't count on the last half kilowatt hour roughly uh yeah that's the name of the game with an old car but you see now every time we plug in now we get 45 kilowatt yeah uh the max temp is almost irrelevant now because uh eventually once it hits if it hits 53° then we rapid gate uh but the min temperat is than the one that makes us callgate right now we've been charging for 12 minutes this is leaf spid by the way it's really nice uh you see here there's a counter that automatically starts once we start uh charging so we've been charging for 12 minutes and now we are down to 21 kw uh but here this is nice we gain heat when we are charging but at one point once the speed throttles then we will not gain much heat plus that we don't want to stay too long at 20 kow we want to ride on 40 plus kilowatt so i calculate that we should have enough now to go to the next charger which is going to be uh uh which alin yeah the same place we stopped at with the i3 but i show you outside briefly is that this is a nice location we have lots of circ k chargers here actually circ k they at least this site has uh four charo plugs available and then there you see uh the good old ion chargers and then we have supercharger in the background there and also yeah uh i just had to show you guys i also haven't been charging over there for a while but look cam power we are in the charging heaven route right [music] now we are now charging once more at this is the sub boil arm wi but look here previously we had 29° now we have 31.6 this is magic man wait wait this gets dangerously close to the rapid gate speed also okay but um yeah all right hopefully we don't rapid gate trying to avoid cold gat but we should get this 45 kilowatt wave now for longer so yeah all good right oh yeah and then here we just happened to stop at the same place we stopped with the i3 also wait how how did the i3 also end up here um i'm not sure but okay not much to do here um not sure if uh mcdonald's is open but uh i mean i have now i drive only around 25 km between the charger it's not i need to stop and pee on every charging stop you see when i did the 500 km challenge with the i3 i didn't even bother using the the navigation or i saw sometimes i use it because i had that i id drive no wa what it called again yeah whatever the the it didn't have touchcreen but here in the lea 10 year old leaf has touchcreen so you see i can do this okay it's a bit weird to scroll but at least you can scroll by the touch screen and then you if you zoom in uh suddenly you start seeing chargers i think this this map must have been updated look here huh map menu new destination wait for the lag par you see oh holy crap this is runs on a two 286 cpu but yeah 21 km away that's the turn around point there's a gap here or there's a a dead zone here wait zoom out zoom from here to sw p uh there is nothing no fast charges in between so yeah that's it we have to go there next and then let me check here how is oh oh yeah okay okay now we start oh now we start throttling slightly but uh yeah this is really good so far seems we are slowly building up some heat in the [music] battery [music] we are now back at r and yeah i don't know if you guys saw it uh in the footage there were some uh road works and they closed the main road i had to go some slow d i don't want to do that since we were close to the d uh to the turn around point i just turn around at that point but we can always just go slightly for the north when once we go to the north loop for example yeah i'll show you but it doesn't matter it's not too big deal i've done this before also in some other challenges but look here now so this is interesting this is actually very this is a real challenge man because um now the battery starts getting hot at 53° c we will rapid gate um so now this is this this usually this is a sweet spot that the the min temp is high enough so we get nice and flat curve but then it doesn't rapid gate yet but there are ways to control the rapid gate i have so many years of experience with leaf the way you control rapid gate is that you didn't charge a while uh while it's charging slow you charge until it drops to let's say 20 kw stay there for a little bit at least what's going to happen then is that you charge slower you add energy into the battery without building up too much heat and once you start driving you give the time longer time to cool down the mean and the max temp yeah and also what you want to do then once you rapid gate or once you want to control the temperature is that you don't arrive with 5% anymore you arrive with roughly 10 or 15% because once you have low state of charge voltage is lower and then with lower voltage uh current goes up and that introduces more heat plus that uh internal resistance seems to be uh higher when once the st chge drops i seen this many many times not only with um leaf but other cars also that towards the end if you go deep you will have uh uh an increase in the temperature towards the end so you have to be a ninja you have to true ninja to control cold gate and rapid gate and control the temperature in the in the in the car in the leaf because the leaf does not have thermal management but i am the thermal [laughter] management okay that was uh almost 15minute dring stop you see we have 8.1 kw hour left now we have a different strategy because now we are getting uh very close to rap i think we actually hit the rapid gate point but it's fine now we just have to make sure that we cool down before the next session and you know previously i was hammering it on the ramp onto the motorway but now i will not hammer it too hard um so this is also part the part of controlling rapid gate is that we cruise maybe at only around 105 something km per hour don't want to go too fast yeah and then he now no big deal if you arrive with 10 15% but try to avoid arriving with 5% we are now at shell o and oh we are rapid gating man we went from coalgate straight to rapid gate now okay well at least we're getting 40 kow i shouldn't complain right but i was struggling to get the max temp to drop so um yeah i need to use all the tricks i know now up my sleeve to try to get out of rapid gate okay well all right um so here you see fortunately now we have tailwind not sure where the wind is blowing but yeah we have tailwind you know what they say there eng new there's no shame of turning around maybe if i figure out that i rap i just cons no no we should finish okay i always deliver the package okay let's just finish it it it might suck a bit but i'm doing this for the entertainment right and in the name of science we're going to see now yeah i think i was a bit hard on the get out the cold gate thing thing yeah but i mean event inevitably it will rapid gate so now we just have to see if we can get out the rapid gate oh the battery is cooking what we have 55 degrees in the battery it's taking 18 kilowatt um okay i calculated i need roughly 7 something kilowatt hours we are pretty much good to go now this session was only 12 minutes long so oh 13 so the next stop is going to be oh sh is going to be um yeah so okay f at uh 36 km from here this navigation is a bit um confusing because you see here it claims 30 km or i mean it says 30 something think oh are we 30 km away no not from the destination but if you go here and you go to route and if you go to route info then you will see that we are 36 km [music] [applause] away [music] we are now at m through and um yeah this is a bit weird right i'm driving slow uphill uh if you want to reduce i mean if you want to um avoid adding too much heat to the battery you have to avoid too high power output and when you go uphill and you try to maintain the speed you will then have higher power output which introduces heat so i'm not losing that much time by going slower in the uphill but then um yeah but then when you go downhill i should go faster uh because then i don't need that much extra power to go faster right and also another problem is that if you regen downhill here uh you will also introduce heat to the battery so you should coast downhill yeah so that's what we're going to do we're going to hit some barely legal speed soon so i have to uh yeah let see just just go slow you can see here here that the power output is low or you can see also here you can see them balls is see going slow now oh just push it over the hill and then well i can either put the car neutral but you can also if you're ninja you can just control the throttle with your uh foot and then just slowly increase the speed this yeah we are now at food set yeah you guys know this c k oh nice charges man that's the thin hyper chargers they are not that common by the way and then we have the fat ones over here with four power modules yeah and then these ones they have only two power one to two power modules uh but okay anyway um normally i would plug in before i start digging around talking but you see whoa what the heck man i'm waiting for this to drop uh previously we had 52° when you plug in this is very important because once you plug once you plug in it will check battery temperature and then dictate how many kilowatt you can get so ideally you want to get this as low as possible yeah you guys know it you know the drill with leave come on come on drop a little bit before i plug in then wait look at this the temperature is rising we have been stationary now i i should have plugged it in at 52.7 now it's 53.3 i don't know why the heck the temperature is rising but also another thing is that i had more kilowatt hour here uh and huh 12.9 and h do i have wacky bms just that env 200 to truma uh how the temperature is rising should i have to plug in now before it rapat more okay let's see now how many kilowatt we get oh 33 kilowatt 34 oh damn uh-oh uh maybe it was a bad idea for me to start with such hot butter but then if i start with cold battery then i coalgate so i have to choose from the start do i want the coalgate or do i want to rapic it after 200 km um man i have to get rid of this car i had to sell it this cary is actually quite bad for long trips",4
Bjorn Nyland,PLqKx2qnB8Xv4rFsIsmw2e1jhYNT-Dux6Z,M9EzCgiFWxo,"this was brought to you by marcus be elmech a planner stone bik camp power and b component uh this is a bit weird look at the the odometer we are about to hit 990,000 km on frankenstein we have 8999 it should be if it's saw decimal it would be 8 99999 wait how many nes is this it's going to hit 90,000 soon there 990,000 km frankenstein he's alive he's alive 990,000 oh [ __ ] we just passed cleavage and we are still going and great news the battery has cooled down to 51.3 de c you see it's- 4° outside it seems that makes wonders for the rapid gate man wow okay well uh i'm going to stop now at the garden one instead small bummer because i was planning on peeing in the cleavage but whatever whatever we just go for garden one instead yeah now we have low battery 8 km left and blinking we are not charging getting 42 kilowatt what a comeback we are back in the game but i notic the same thing here just previously is that we arrived with 51.0 de and then it went up to 52 53 and i think 54 by the time i plug it in so yeah it seems um heat is built up in the battery and then uh heat must then transfer for some of the other places to heat up the so once that happens you just have to quickly plug in before it rises even more so yeah now this is great because now we get the good session so yeah over here it's uh -5° c further south it was plus 2° so we have 7° c difference and that seems to make a big difference when it comes to passively cooling in the leaf wow and you can see over here it's more winter i actually it uh i it here in the north i'm just a few kilometers away from home now and because here the uh it stays um it stays drier and the snow stays fluffier for a longer time versus oslo where everything just becomes quite slushy and wet and yeah whatever so i don't mind as long as it's not minus 20 then no problem so now i'm going to go to mcdonald's little ptop another thing i noticed is that um okay the heater is on right now you can see here uh but i notic this on the previous stop also that if i start the car right after we park this pink is not active so what does this mean um my best guess is that there is residual heat in the ptc yeah this is ptc but we don't have heat pump we don't have that kind of alien technology but there is residual heat in the system here somewhere because we just drove with the heater on so if you park and you don't start the heater then okay nothing happens uh but now it seems it's pulling the leftover heat from the system and put it in the cabin yeah i feel the heat here but eventually this pink will start rising yeah yeah yeah okay you see after roughly 3 4 minutes then this pink line starts increasing because now the heat has been lost okay i want to switch off yeah want to switch off now so then this happen okay that's [music] fine [music] we are now charging at minon getting 44 kilow oh oh yeah i that fire up the car i want to suck the residual heat from the hbac now we can see how long it takes yeah it should take around 3 4 minutes before the heat is off uh off okay anyway yeah now we are here um i think it's time for some food again man is this a charge so often yeah and then i can show on the map is that the next stop is going to be tongan and uh see so okay zoom out zoom out a little bit and then i go here uh should i forgot sorry sorry i forgot the screen is a bit bright but okay so um here tongen from tongen there's a big gap wait where is the heck is tongen i think it's roughly here zoom in zoom in wait that should be tongue huh what oh what okay one thing i don't about this uh system is that you don't see the names that is okay i'm a little bit confused now but it's roughly here i'll figure out where the heck it [music] is we are now charging again uh this is yet another the c k i tend to visit many c k uh so yeah um this time i use a 50 kw charger we have lots of chargers over there uh so yeah uh the battery is a bit hot um yeah so this time i didn't get uh more than 40 kow oh [ __ ] now it's in the state where okay now i want to stop the heat thing yeah okay anyway so it seems the best deal is to leap roughly 30 km between the charge if i want to go more then i either have to drive slower which is also not the bad i mean not the best idea uh or how to charge long deep higher which is also going to be slow so normally when i charge now to roughly 55 is% then oh [ __ ] sorry then i get around 20 kilow towards the end so if i want to go higher let's say it's 80% then have to camp at 10 kilow or slower so not going to do that [music] we're now in brundall i managed to go slightly beyond the point i was going to start at so that's great news but over here it is snowing this is not great for consumption but okay whatever um man first i was oh yeah they have campire stalls under the roof but these are ccs only so i had to use one of these uh wanted to demonstrate how awesome it is to have stalls under the roof but okay so man we are still not done with the challenge we're only 361 km so the turn around normally the turnaround point would be um b would be um zoom in here a bit but since i turn around early uh i'm going to go past it and go to uh mu which is right around here i think zoom in a bit wait here here yes roughly here okay map menu new destination i mean it's old this is 10 year old system but it still works yeah as long as the map is updated then it works great but you see that that's 12 km yeah so i have to drive there and then drive back again and come back here and that'll be 20 what what no it's supposed to be 28 km round trip i'm not sure what the heck happened there [music] okay we're back at uh brundall charging up uh getting 40 kow okay i'm not going to complain at least uh the temperature here doesn't go sky high but i don't see 50° anymore but okay getting 40 kw or something that's good enough one thing that bothers me a bit is that this navigation okay as it is good yeah but there's something weird when i go to men menu here and i go for destination um wait history oh here it is here is i forgot it's here just a little bit hidden okay um i think this one strong the problem is i don't know where which is which strong vean no no no no no back known street name i have to kind of know where each look e6 maybe yeah that's one i think this is the one i want that's tongen i'm going to i need to backtrack now where i came from because this is uh suitable distance for my situation 34 yeah that's it yeah tongen we have to backtrack man it's snowing yeah i ain't going out there uh yeah so i'll just stay in the nice warm leaf here so i have to say that even if it's - 6° outside it's still nice and warm in here it could maybe be because we have a battery beneath us that is 53° [music] c [music] we are now back at tongen and you know i noticed something i have had so many charting sessions so many handshakes nissan or i mean chadu never fails handshake because it's just a different protocol and it's a different physical connector so cho might be superior in that regard when it comes to handshake and robustness versus ccs which tends to fail a lot in some cars but um we still want to face out cho and uh ccs is going to be the dominator but okay look i arrived with less than 52° c oh i had to fire always fire up the car when where's the button always fire up the car because i want to get the the residual heat into the cabin especially when it's - 7° c yeah want to keep the carabin nice and warm because in a way you know when you are the way it works with nissan is that for example here if if i can get only 39 kow into the battery if the heater steals 5 kw or 3 kw i would then get less uh kilowatt or into the battery right but in a way we are still inputting the same amount of energy right it's just that some goes into the battery some goes into heat in the car so in a way it still kind of makes [music] sense this is the second to last journey stop here at minon yeah just man that weather this is not my favorite weather i would prefer it to be uh dry i mean powder snow rather than this wet snow it's - 3° c outside so i don't want to go outside even let me see yeah all right so yeah we're almost done now man where's the time 9h hour mark now [ __ ] oh we're still not done how is the battery doing uh it's okay it's okay yeah still rapid gting but it's not going much higher than [music] this this is it finally the the charg 15th charging stop we need to top up just for 5 minutes yeah oh oh we're getting 40 kow oh yeah nice nice okay so i will just take a quick pit stop here at uh sure let's go outside okay let's go it's better visually if you go outside you can hear the noises the challenge now is to try to finish within 10 hours we are roughly at 9 and 1/2 hour mark we should be able to finish within 10 hours it's funny because other cars they finish 1,000 km within 10 hours that was the initial one hour 1,000 km challenge but then the leaf needs to finish it before 10 hours but only 500 km okay we are good to go you see we char for 5 minutes but um you know what i'm going to charge extra for convenience first i was planning on stopping at cleavage but whatever uh we would just turn around at cleavage and then i will go clean the car or some [ __ ] and then i go home straight home so this is the convenient charge so we just now count how many extra minutes we charge here so i can go straight home yeah i don't i i'm tired of visiting charges man i have visited 15 charges on this 500 km [laughter] trip okay let's do the countdown 49 and1 49 and2 49 and3 49 94 495 come on [ __ ] stein finish this 496 497 498 4999 500 time 921 uh we had 5 minute of deduction so that means that it was 9 hours and 40 6 minutes 9:45 oh and the last time now was oh [ __ ] can you see it okay yeah all right we're back home now so yeah we just have a small list now for the 500 k challenge but uh yeah as expected the leaf is the slowest one of them all we just have to uh we just have to test it and benchmark it but in winter yeah the consumption in leaf is higher and that's why it wasn't doing that well so compared to the i3 i3 was way better but uh yeah um what i wanted to test also here was that during winter it seems once you rapid gate it doesn't go crazy in summer it would just hit i think it was 55 degre cs i don't remember exactly what happened during last summer yeah um and then once you replicate it's just game over it just goes dog so here actually you if you don't hammer too hard the battery will cool down and you can get goodish charging session the only problem is that the battery is so small and uh the car is semi thirsty so you still have to charge we saw roughly every 30ish kilometers which is a bit crazy yeah but at least we tried it now i just wanted to experiment how it was and this is probably going to be the last test with frankenstein because i'm i'm kind of fed up with him because um it worked okay when i lived in oslo al and i could drive him for a short trip but now suddenly i have to drive from oslo no i have to drive from yesim so i have to drive longer distance and then it doesn't work but it it doesn't mean that this le this old leaf is useless if if i would still leave in oslo then the leaf would work great for local runs or even the press car shut that i use it for but uh my life situation has changed and therefore this doesn't fit for me but it will fit for someone else yeah so it will be actually for sale i'll make a muskus i will deliver it to muskus and then he will take care of well not him personally but his company his uh his uh uh employees they will uh wash the car and prepare it and take photos and put up ad on fin unless you guys already want to buy it uh i'm going to sell it for 30,000 nook yeah so anyway i think that's going to be for now i hope you guys enjoy this as always thank you for watching and talk to you later",4
Bjorn Nyland,PLqKx2qnB8Xv4rFsIsmw2e1jhYNT-Dux6Z,IVEcn-KOeTc,"this was brought to you by marcus be elmech a planner stone b c power and be component yo what's up i'm going to get ready now for yet another 500 k challenge not 1,000 because behind me here i have an old eolf with lots of kilometers on it and you know i previously did it with uh the bmv i3 and i3 and eolf they are roughly the same age they have roughly the same price actually i3 even being more expensive than the eolf but i believe that maybe eagles can beat i3 in this challenge so we're going to find out man we'll see so yeah i've done the preparation i'll show you guys the starting position i have the heater in the back yeah i just want to have some uh i want to preheat the car so it it reports as 27.7 de inside and then battery is only at 6° but i think that's fine this battery has so so much cobalt that it shouldn't cate much but it will rapid gate eventually maybe we'll see if we can keep the rapa under control so yeah i've charged it to well it's supposed to be 100% the car scanner doesn't show 100% actually shows 96% when it's fully charged so um yeah i'm getting ready now wait where do you see the on opener here um oh man the door is open here but okay the car has done lots of kilometers and we will actually go all the way here maybe to o maybe beyond it we'll see so um the starting time will be 22 50s let's get it ready to unplug in well actually i unplug but let's get it ready to leave now all right we're on the move so we actually started at 2251 to be exact so um yeah i'm cruising at 110 on the speed though but that's actually only 103 gps speed hm okay that's a bit weird 103 104 okay but um we have a small disadvantage which is that i have stuned tires on right now but uh these should be efficient so i don't think we will have any a significantly higher uh consumption i've actually seen that some studed tires might even be more efficient than studless tires so and since we have n and studed tires then no problem there so yeah uh my only concern is this temperature here uh we'll see once we arrive but we don't want it to be too cold because then we will cold gate but then also not too hot because then we rapid gate so i think the speed here 110 or i mean four should be uh a good balance between uh travel speed and and uh yeah uh not hammering too hard efficiency i think if you go at 90 you will arrive slower yeah that's my claim i can always calculate this i don't have to do the test actual yeah we are now charging at vest b um yeah wow look at this even at 11.5 de c we're getting maximum speed uh well the reason why we don't get 40 kow kniv probably because i'm running the heat there uh but man it is cold outside it's minus 10° outside but i had to deduct 7 minutes because initially it's beeping because the car is okay initially i went up there you see where the super charges are i tried two different stalls i tried and it failed on handshake several times so gave up um so i'm starting to wonder if eagles uh cannot have hand sh on v3 so we might want to avoid supercharger or might might want to gamble everything on supercharger here we have bailout point so that's good but yeah it is cold outside i have to show you it is freaking cold outside but the eagle is relatively efficient so you can see that we managed to average 215 watt hour kilm that's not too bad man wait how it 78 km hm um i wonder next the turn r point is 72 km away um maybe i'll just drive a little bit slower just so we can reach that point that would be a a good deal yeah oh yeah this is the beauty of eagles look at this actually i think this state is a bit off it's supposed to be over 70% right now 72 maybe so the eag can maintain 40 or 125 amp a little bit over 40 kw until roughly 72% before it throttles whereas the i3 for example um throttles earlier only around 50% it start throttling uh the only minus with eolf is that the voltage is bit low and then it has no thermal management no active cooling so we will see if we eventually we replicate or not but fortunately it's cold outside so maybe yeah theus 7.5 or whatever we have right now uh only supposed to beus 10 maybe that will cause the battery to not rapid gate all right that was roughly 22 minutes charing stop we went from 15% to uh 20 no to 82% so um yeah see the battery heated up to 26.5 de c it's going to be interesting to see how the battery cools down now right h or if it cools down or not yeah and also what kind of temperature rapid gates that h okay but yeah i figured that that i can't go to schweon uh it will be too long uh or too i have to stop at uh sob so that means roughly 50 kilm [music] sprints we are now at sburg it's so cold that i don't even feel going outside right now yeah we have mcdonald's over here we are charging at camp power okay look here we have driven 151 km so far according to google it's supposed to be 128 km so well i don't see any decimals but close enough i calculated we have roughly 2.3 or 3 2.4% over reporting that's means that we have to count to 512 km not 500 well not 500 yeah um maybe it has something to do with the tires i suspect the tires yeah but anyway so how is it going now yeah um still nice and flat but one thing i noticed is that the the uh heat doesn't go up that much here in the eagle versus for example leaf that also has no thermal management [music] what we just turn around at the turn around point at s soon and uh you know i'm live streaming here as you guys can see that yeah they look at the view and stuff i'm going to show you if i play music okay okay this is the one uh that has a base you know rus music okay look look look look look at the live stream though [music] it makes them diy the base makes the front wind screen shake yeah of course there's nothing you can do about it um you can't put the gimball there gimball not going to help man [music] oh yeah there was a low battery warning now i think it's based on distance and then it automatically puts you in the eco mode but you can just press this button and then you can go back to normal mode uh but eventually once you go deeper then it's en forced to go eco plus which turns off the heater but for now this is a trick you have to do every time otherwise you'll be in eco mode and then eco mode restricts some power and then uh reduces cabin comfort and when it's- 9° c outside i don't want to run ecco mode man we are now at sui and yeah we have 34.5 de in the battery still no rapid gate some guy in the live stream claims that it rapid gates at 40° so so far so good but we have to deduct another 4 minutes because let me show you uh we are now on cam power first i try the supercharger behind the trucks also didn't work so v3 and v2 supercharger doesn't seem to work with eulf i don't know what's up with that keeps failing on handshake so yeah that's it we will just uh avoid super chargers then slight bummer but uh i guess no big deal it's still [music] beeping [music] we are getting close to shell o and uh yeah um we are we are about to replicate we have 38° c in the battery i saw that initially when we started driving that the temperature started going up so there was only one way to do it i had to treat this car a leaf i have to slow down so instead of cruising at 103 on the on gps i have to now cruise at 93 km per hour on gps yeah so this is the trick to avoid uh heat buildup so yeah maybe it's no big deal because now it means that the consumption goes down a bit so all right um let's um stop at shell l that's the only option if we try to skip this one then we have over 20 km until the next one which is um shell mort road we are now charging at shell o and man look at this minus 11.5 de oh it's cold outside man yeah um you can see it's all empty yeah yeah all empty over here okay so this will be interesting because uh this is the session where it's supposed to rapid gate once this hit 40° supposedly then it starts throttling and there's nothing you can do about it so well well well maybe we won't be able to beat i3 after all uhoh we hit 40° c and you see it starts rapid gating with supposed to get over 40 kow now a it's game over the sun has enter the [music] chat [music] we are now at c k body gate and we are rapid gting where are we let me see 40 let me let me stop hb for a bit here so under normal condition we'll be getting over 40 roughly 40 kow or 125 amp yep that's rapid gate right right there wait but 35 kw if i fire up the heater will i charge even slower or will it just pull extra power from the charger h let me see oh wait not sure oh it seems it pulls extra power let me see i can show you here if i can i can ninja this screen i don't have to go outside even wait can i oh come on come on focus there i'm taking 39 kw from the charger uh but i'm ooh ah okay we have we are proven it now that eolf is in fact not leaf design it pulls extra power for heater yeah yeah huh all right we're almost done charging um previously when we charged to 82% it took only 21 minutes now it seems to take roughly 24 minutes so that means that we are 3 minutes slower than before h we need to charge 4 more times that means we'll lose uh about uh 12 minutes then okay let's go uh we just started driving and i noticed this weird uh thing in display here you see and yeah it looks something related to uh cruise control and that's it uh when you try to enable cruise control it say error acc uh normally it's caused by block sensor but well do we have any snow here no fog no uh frozen rain no why the heck is the sensor not working i have to figure out how how to set the manual cruise control then if it's possible normally you can press and hold the distance button for a couple seconds and that should enable something uh ac what we are now at the doll and over here it's -6.5 de c oh i have to slow down there's a b but uh yeah um now the battery is at 42° we left with 43 so it's it cool down slightly yeah but there is difference now there's almost 50° c delta between uh outside temperature and the battery temperature it better cool down slightly i have to use limiter now uh because the cruise control is kaput so yeah let me see show switch it wait yeah you see calut so yeah okay we use limiter then we are now at s mines soon at the hyper hyper charger yeah do you guys remember that song hyper hyper hyper hyper yeah anyway maybe germans know but uh oh okay we're down to 35 kw but 41° c in the battery now it's game over so um yeah but you see i keep arriving with actually it when it says 24% here it's actually 20% on the charger display so car g is slightly misreporting so it means that i shouldn't charge to 82% to 80% i can charge roughly 75% yeah and go a little bit deeper so but now we just have to sit and wait i have roughly 20 minutes of nap time so yeah i mean it's 4:30 at night so maybe i need to take a nap so let's see how do you do what oh no it has this it has this sc screwing thing here to recline okay let's nap wait did it stop there what no it goes s at least okay at least it's better than the i3 because the i3 you couldn't recline this far the i3 would stop further up here it's i three is um economy class whereas the eolf is business class recline oh [music] yeah [music] we are now at s k ring socket juing up okay but um yeah consistently now we're getting roughly 33 kow it seems at least that um temperature it's not going crazy so it stays around here so yeah okay anyway um this time also i didn't have adaptive cruise control so seems maybe the radar is just smish you see yeah the strange thing is that um this car doesn't have camera wait no wait no some people claim it doesn't have camera but that one over there that might be just the rain sensor right doesn't seem a camera it's too small for a camera so is the ego only basing it on the radar here h okay what if i take a piece of paper and then try to clean the radar somehow i thought it was self cleaning radar oh there's some schmutz there okay maybe that helps right we're back on the road and i have some good news and some bad bad news the good news is that the radar cleaning did work and now we can use adaptive cruise control again the bad news is that we have uh just passed the 7h hour mark and we still have to drive another hour no no more than an hour yeah because we this one need to show 512 km since it's under report over reporting that means that a little bit over an hour of driving and maybe at least a half an hour charging so this is going to be at 8 and 1 half hour mark it seems 8 and a half hour run and that's uh 40 minutes slower than uh i3 oh oh oh well well well all right this is the second to last turning stop we are now at yx quarter and this is the name of the game every time we now we get roughly 41 42° c and we get 30 32 kw yeah i mean it's still better than a leaf rapid gating and also we get this 32 kw nice and flat until around 65% before it slowly tapers off so yeah uh should i complain uh no but can we beat i3 uh no okay man it's so cold but in all fairness uh the i3 run was roughly zero de or closer to 0° today it's yeah minus 10 many many times so that's a bit uh disadvantage for us let me get out of here so we need to charge one more time either we stop at espa or minon i have to figure out where to stop but i think i'm going to go for min we have to go 50 km that that means we need to charge it for a while okay so far so good right yeah i think this is a good location for me to make a thumbnail uh now might want to go on this side oh what the heck man i just noticed something just a big chunk of there oh that is satisfying that is so satisfying man look here do we have more we have more see on this side oh look oh dam there some fat chunks right there no wonder why we have bad consumption just kidding well actually i'm not sure if this affects the consumption or not but yeah just want to kick it off because eventually if you don't get rid of it it will freeze and become quite hard yeah oh what the heck man um next stop is going to be min soon see 56 km i don't know but when i try to navigate press start then it bugs it also happened it started already on the previous leg so yeah uh seems navigation is bugged we is have to uh feel how far away from the destination we are now ah it seems to be working now so you have to press and hold this power button here for 10 seconds and then you see the volkswagen logo it reboots and now if we try to do this so min soon and then start we see that we get these options yeah so now it works just needed a little [music] reboot this is it the last turning stop every time now we get uh yeah we are at 42% sorry degrees and we get 32 kw so we are now on cem power charger you can see behind it there and over here i i don't want to go outside man it's- 15° c outside but we're almost done now wait wait we we at 7 we we at 8 hour and 40 minute mark man uh can we at least finish it before 10 hour mark no but you see we have to go to 5112 km so in roughly 15 more km we will be done du yeah okay so quick pit stop go to the restroom and then off we go again this is it the final run the sun is coming up soon yeah i'm not talking about the sun but the other sun okay anyway so now i feel i can hammer it i charge maybe a couple of perc uh more than i need so so yeah i have the luxure going at 110 on the speed though which is uh what again 103 gps speed okay so we just have to wait for the counter to count to 512 now uh there is no decimal here so i don't know how we going to do a 4999 uh we just have to wait i guess and then i'll try to feel how it goes okay normally we would do a a countdown now uh to 512 but i have no idea man okay 4996 4997 498 499 um 4 99.5 4 there 500 km 80 that is exactly 9 hours slow down slow down l up l it's- 17 ° outside here this is unfair against i3 wow 9 hours holy moll has slow down the otheris we run run out of juice oh what was the consumption what we have to calculate the consumption the consumption here includes when we idling so yeah the the actual consumption is different than this we are finally home yeah here's the xc40 that's the lovely house and oh we have 6 km of range left wait huh power limit went up to 95 kow again well that's weird okay i i was down to 40 kow power limit well actually this one is incorrect yeah yeah because um uh here you can see that we have low power this is this is the power limit meter thingy i don't know what it was in the in the fossil version of golf maybe oil temperature or some yeah but yeah so when you are this low then the car enforces you to use eco plus mode so you have no heaters you can't you can't use any of these other modes yeah so it becomes cold in the cabin you can also see it here that the temperature in the cabin starts dropping now okay let's plug it in then but okay i'm not going to i'm not done yet by the way i'm going to plug in a little bit just to charge up but i want to see how long does it take for the battery to cool down when i'm sitting out in in my - 15° we need to find out wait wait wait a minute wait a minute look look look here consumption 2 kilow hour per hour so you see and then man the germans but okay what i want to show you is then we've been parking for roughly 15 minutes and we are already down to 40.5 de c wow this is a very effective way of cooling down the battery just park the car in minus 13.5 de and then you cool down the battery we've been camping here for a little bit over an hour and now you're outside temperature m okay you see here minus 11.5 de temperature is rising and we are down to 34.5 de c ooh okay now that i'm waiting for the car to cool down the battery here's a bell is ael what what what abc this little princess now no no no it's a okay see look look at look at this view wow that is amazing during night uh we have these snow covered trees just in llum uh because in in yes i realized that it's not that windy so you get this awesome here car is outside and look look on this side man i i didn't realize that we had such an awesome view here look look at this wow wow wo b b that's you belle is a belle daddy yeah daddy daddy no we've been parked here for 4 and a half hours roughly it's still - 11.5 de outside let's see what is car scanner reporting now w look at that holy macaroni 6.5 de wow that was quick cool down okay so now we know after roughly 4 hours or something then rapid gate is gone g n so before i tested this i was thinking what is the point of this 500 km challenge uh we already have the yellow test right well you know test show that in the test the eulf was actually 5 minutes faster or maybe in more even terms we say that at least the eulf is as fast as the i3 but that's only 235 km trip but here we go 500 km and then you start seeing big differences between cars that has active cooling uh i3 versus uh well eolf or leaf so yeah uh it still has a purpose but it's probably pointless to go 1,000 km that would be very painful and these cars they will usually never go that far anyway but 500 km challenge is still a very useful test yeah so all right we were humilated by the i3 in the beginning i i was so certain that the the low temperature would allow the car to drive without rapid gate but yes i was wrong i stand corrected and the i3 is better than the eolf at least for long trips so anyway i think that's going to be it for now i hope you guys enjoy this as always thank you for watching and talk to you later",4
Bjorn Nyland,PLqKx2qnB8Xv4rFsIsmw2e1jhYNT-Dux6Z,puJjrDunU2E,this was brought to you by marcus be elmech a planner stone bik camp power and b component yo what's up we're now in front of the house and today i'm going to retest the eagle 500 km challenge so okay before you guys start wondering what the heck why are you retesting what was wrong and i hear me out previous test i did it in 9 hours and believe that it was not optimal uh it was freaking cold outside so the consumption was high and also a weird scenario where i started with somewhat pre-warm battery i had around 6° celsius in the battery before before departure and what else was it again yeah i think i drove slightly too fast uh so you know i calculate that today okay it's not that cold today it should do it in not 9 hours but 8 and 1 half or maybe at least 8 hours and 45 minutes i'm not sure but according to my calculation 8 and 1/2 hours should even be possible so that's what i want to find out because eventually i'm going to return this car and i feel the eagles needs to at least be able to compete against the i3 on more even terms which is not so freezing cold and also i feel i want to test this because you know i want to figure out what is the best scenario strategy for you who owns an old car and you just happen to travel far you might not have uh the money to buy an expensive car right actually this is a real world case i remember my neighbor over there at the she used to own first generation eolf and they would drive from oslo all the way to bu yeah i'm not sure how long it is that that's pretty far man they would even drive during winter so okay so what i did now is that i let the car sit outside and let the battery cool down because fortunately the the eego factory can charge relatively fast even if it's cold so let me show you what the setup is this time more realistic setup um we are now charging back to 100% okay try to preheat the battery he sorry tr pe the car i set departure time but for some reason it doesn't seem to fire up the heater that's a bit weird but okay anyway you see we have only- 1 and 1 12° this time um and also this time we start with yeah almost 1° cus in the battery so i think that should be fine and i'll be cruising not too fast this time so now we are just waiting around 10 more minutes until we hit this will be 96% and that that will be actually 100% so it's slightly misreported here so we will just follow the same route as before drive south all the way to swers and then not again you guys know drill and then i want to see can we actually improve this can we give some proper consumer advice about how you should drive this beetle volkswagen yeah that's outo uh okay we are good to go now i was slightly delayed i had to figure out the way to reset the center trip meter here we're going to start at 2332 okay let's go off we go that's a bit old time but off we go oh yeah and there is the plaid the plaid lemon no the plaid lime the plaid lime is there sh okay okay off we go i reset everything here this is the first starting stop at yx soon look at the numbers man wow impressive consumption and we managed to go that far with 10% left but let's see now how fast are we going to charge the battery is quite cold only 8° c uh look at that look at the here here it's buming up we actually slightly cating wait wait wait what what happens if i fire up the heater a let's see now is he going to steal heat from that or what's going to happen wow we get 35 kow this is impressive man let me check something here 35 kw there want to see the session here 30 ooh it seems it's pulling extra power for heating yeah 37 37 versus me check here 3 oh this is a good idea you want to do this you want to you want to run the heater now yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that don't worry don't worry that the coold get slightly because this will increase to the point where it rapid gates but i have to show you guys this location this is the first time i come actually i'm not sure if this is the first time i think i've been there before with p long long time ago but look look they have uno x charges under the roof uh and what's cool about these chargers is that you can use credit card and it's 4 hi i think that's a follower youtube yeah yeah um so they i wonder if they actually remove some pumps yeah to put the these ones and then we have more over there that's also uno x and then we have recharge there wow huh welcome to norway but i i the concept of uno x because first of all they use hyperchargers which are very reliable compared to some other brands um and under the roof and card payment well actually card payment is getting mandatory anyway but okay anyway let me see back to this man look at this look look look today it's usually this it's slightly cold getting but no big deal yeah no no problem wait wait wait wait can i get out of this uh eco mode now okay that's good all right uh now we wait oh look at this at 10° cus we get 125 and maximum speed oh yeah 42 kilowatt hour per hour anyway food for the day is this i brought some rib well actually it's just the the pre-cooked rib grilled rib whatever from menu still crunchy oh with flt i don't know if if um this is too pert food or not because i don't think norwegians will eat it this m m m so good and then real and this is still the stor b spork yeah use the spork luke and i went closer shopping today with wifey and i came over this which is dr pepper cherry what the heck is this well i had to try it i mean dr pepper is already quite uh weird taste how is dr pepper cherry i i tried cherry coke or something you know yeah vanilla [music] coke huh i need to teste this so you guys don't have to taste it or you have to it tastes the regular drct pepper it actually tastes good it tastes dr pepper but where's the cherry it has a sweet taste the pepper wait wait dr pepper has this this distinct dr pepper taste it's host the soft you know but here it seems the cherry has kind of even up smooth out the taste it tastes great go get it yeah we are now at spos this is a turn round point we're charging at the hypercharger i don't know if we can see it there i have the choice between 50 kw trim chargers the one that goes when you charge it or hyper charger suchal hypercharger and then the battery is slowly heating up the inedible in inedible in ediable wait what's it called again whatever it's happening now yeah so uh it's slowly heating up we're still getting maximum speed for now once this battery temperature hits 40° then we have a rapid gate so we just want to avoid rapid gate so we've been avoiding it for now at least yeah [music] we are now back at the uno x or 7-eleven i here soon i it i it i it that we have these chargers man yx yeah they're coming now yx yeah over there so yeah you see interesting the battery stayed stable at 24° it didn't heat up during this drive but um every time we charge it's going to heat up so that is unavoidable but um yeah let's see so next stop um is going to be c k batter i tend to end up there but that's whooping 70 km away but as long as it char to roughly 85% i should be able to reach it so yeah over here it's only -2° c you see it's already way better than previous run when it was -12° c so um so far i can show you that um here this is the last leg 213 wat kil the car is over reporting distance slightly so we have to go to 512 km um and then this is the total okay i think it's time for some more food well or well i mean it's still food grapes oh yeah m m crunchy and sweet m remember that i always eat healthy food when i'm on the road trip y y oh yeah i saw this on the way down um e6 is close so there's a detour i think i've taken this detour before it's supposed to be around 10 minutes so the way we do it is that we count the time once this dour starts and then the distance we calculate the average speed we drive in the detour and then we okay whatever you guys don't know need to know but i figured out a way to do this correctly yeah so we'll compensate for this of course okay let me see 217 now at night and distance is 26 km um the truck in front of me is transporting snow dude we're in norway and in winter trucks they they burn diesel to transport snow where where the heck are you going with the snow dude you can just jump the snow over here nobody's going to care nobody's going to notice we have so much snow anyway where are you going where you going man d he speeds up come back here come back here i'm going to hammer you he drives he stole the [music] snow freaking milkman is doing snow the milkman is transporting snow wonder where the heck he's going he's probably going to those uh snow hotels with it or ice bar yeah of course of course that that is some quality snow right there we are now charging at wh yeah um getting uh expected speed battery is slowly heats up now 28 degrees cs but you see um on the previous run we would we would at this point we will rapid gate if you look at yeah yeah we would rapid gate already at roughly 240 kilom and now we are still far away from rapid gate yeah we can probably still charge at least two more time before rapid gate so this is a lot lot better than previous run okay want to check out something here you know this is where the hydrogen station was because i heard that it is shut down want to check it out yep it's dead deed they're shut down everything you see maybe some people have been walking here they to check it out oh what the heck is this yeah um that pump is down seems the station here whatever uh is not operational anymore and then over here we have a hydrogen car that was stranded here because it didn't get fuel actually what car is this are you kidding me i i i was i thought i'm i was making a joke hy that means hyro are you huh really is this this is the old prius the old prius oh miror yeah this is the first gen no not the prus prus meai it's the first gen meai for some reason it's part here i don't know what the story is about about it but yeah hydrogen is the future hydrogen is the next big boom yeah for you guys who don't know it was actually a big boom at um um sanva a couple of years ago when that station went boom okay anyway let's get back to the car what the heck i was over there with the live stream laughing at the hydrogen station and the mirai stuck there and then when i came back charging has stopped someone's been sabotaging in this you see so after 9 and 1/2 minute it stopped we have to figure out look at the log and see when it stopped and then we just the duct for this i had to [music] restart [music] uhoh we are now at neoness and we have some frozen rain it's -3° c you see when i wipe yeah okay sometimes it wipes completely off sometimes we get some frozen stuff on the wind screen but no problem i can just go here to the menu and then we activate the front heated wind screen oh yeah look at that look at oh yeah oh is it is it a bit slippery here on the road oh a little bit oh it's a bit wobbly but do i do i care do i wor it no because we have nukan uh nine wait it's got nuk hakita nine stuned tires wait what about darkness i have lead bar this car is unstoppable oh yeah okay let's play the music wa wait oh yeah fun just enjoy the ride [music] man we are now charging at minun look we left with what it was at least 32° c and during the drive now we cool down to 30° we are still not rapid gating even after 3 uh let's say 320 km so far wow you see it's only - 3° c you know you would expect that well in the previous run when it was -5 or - 12 it would cool down the battery faster right now the problem is that when it gets that cold then the consumption goes through the roof or the consumption goes high is it it wasn't that bad today and when the consumption is high you can't drive too far and you yeah and then you need to charge more often so what you could what you see here is that the heat slowly builds up for every charing session you charge the heat builds up so when it's cold you need to charge more often and that means you have to heat up more often so yeah plus that when you when we manage to drive 50 to 70 km between each charge you give the car more time to cool down in between the charing sessions so this is why i wanted to retest this i wanted to prove that in more normal conditions this car can do it way better over here not much to uh show you guys uh we are station know here there's a there's a leaf over there just happened to have two cars with our thermal management there but today is new year's eve see 31st of december so yeah but um that means that i'm going to work now through the night but then tomorrow night it's going to be uh the countdown uh and then of course i'll stay home and spend some time with the family well actually i think uh uh for uh for the 99 i mean for the end of the year we'll probably be sleeping both us because we have small children oh a small child yeah in the house now but i noticed that it's really quiet on the roads today uh even now it's really quiet it's sunday but also yeah holiday it's season time well let's check something here do we have heated radar let see the radar should be located here oh yes we have wait wait wait oh yeah look at that we have in at the coree we have roughly it's hard to see i think it's roughly 20° c yeah made in deand huh quality um first i thought that we have some salt schuts on the headlights well it turns out that we have ice yeah you see i wasn't kidding when i said that we had frozen rain and let's see what about the lead bar oh the lead bar also got some okay we need to scrape it clean because i want to have the lead bar um clear because from we're going in this direction and past this point it will be pitch dark with no street lights so i want to have the lead bar clear especially the lead bar is very important but also the light here wow look at that okay i need to to turn down the exposures you actually see what's going on there roughly oh yeah why do they go to thailand during these months well because i prefer nice warm thai women rather than cold norwegian [music] food [music] [music] a [music] we're now charging at the bidon and look here still only 31° c wow i wonder if we hit equilibrium where the battery temperature doesn't go higher than that uh i wonder if it can go faster now we've been cring a 93 94 k power throughout the challenge and we are almost wait wait wait we need we need this charging stop and one more yeah that's it okay so i need to find out on the map where we're going to go we're going to go to the turn point first and then next stop might be quter maybe uh there seems to be something wrong here i'm not sure if it's a charger or the car but look here we're taking only 35 kw it's supposed to to be 40 kw and 125 amp um okay let's try to move charger and see if that helps all right i just deduct one minute because we swapped i didn't move the car i just swept the stall but let's see it has quite slow ramp up eolf but we'll see if it hit 125 amp now or if it's still at 100 110 huh okay well at least we tried uh just for in the name science we want to see where the limitation is but it seems interesting the battery is not too hot but it's it starts derating you know i wonder if we have punishment points just the toyota betet 4x uh after some charting sessions it will just throttle naturally um interesting in that case i should have gone faster i could have heated up the battery to almost 40° c uh if we knew that we would have yeah throttle anyway the only minus is that if we go faster you have to charge more and then you have to spend time charging also uh yeah so maybe it wasn't that bad of a deal so far wait it's even slower now what h wait let's change stall again,4
Bjorn Nyland,PLqKx2qnB8Xv4rFsIsmw2e1jhYNT-Dux6Z,99PpOwqydMI,"this was brought to you by marcus be elmech a planner stor bik camp power and b component yo what's up we are now in the garage getting ready for 500 km challenge with classic ionic the king has returned the king of efficiency so yes remember this is 500 not 1,000 this is the classic cars i always want to do this this car i don't know if you recognize it maybe you didn't or i have tested it a couple of years ago i did the serer mile test well actually i did sunday driving plus uh serer m test but i think i also did the 1,000 col challenge the car that often it belongs to paul sco my good friend and he has now installed some lead bar linear laser elite 18 he has done some other modification to the car actually a front i can show that later we have a uh ambient light here okay whatever so what matters is that uh this is a classic ionic it has 67,000 km on the anomer shouldn't have too much degradation and we going to see now how awesome is this car versus some of the other that we tried yeah here we have car scanner we are now topping up back to 100% so the fastest it's um bmv i3 with 7 hours and 50 minutes this car i believe should do it in somewhere 6 hours it it is in insanely good yeah so we're just going to get ready now in 2 minutes yeah we should start in 2 minutes then or roughly there now it's 2: at night all right we're on the moon now so you see it's uh 225 at night on the weekday so it is quite empty for now but uh it's going to be semi cramp by the time we turn back so i started a bit late i would not wanted to start around 2 hours earlier but okay whatever it should still be okay so we we will still go for the regular route south first where can you see it on the map here south and then nor oh this is cool and then north again but the car actually shows your gps speed huh so 116 115 116 gps when be cruising at 120 on the the speedo all right all right awesome man classic ionic should be super efficient huh we start with 14 to 15° c in the battery and i heard that optimal uh battery temperature is uh 25 but then at 40° it will rapid gate but it has at least air cool batteries i'll show more about that also if you don't know how it works okay now we're just going to enjoy the nice and somewhat noisy ride in the classic ionic yeah the king has returned look here my friend he added this there's a button there also here to enable to turn on and off and also the other button here is to turn on and off the lead by i think i want to have it on for now all we're now in the new tunel and there is slow down here oh what the heck man i i hear the bit holy damn holy crap that is loud you know what is kind of funny those roost boo they have extra uh uh generators because they're so noisy but then the guys inside they use air plugs what what's the point man okay anyway uh yeah we we count count now how slow we go and then we i'm doing around 70 or something so we just count i check the distance and time and we just calculate the aage speed here and i i know that it's a 90 normally is a 90 z so we just deduct for this uh this is unavoidable since we're doing it on the weekday but it's fine wow wow look at that volvo lr low ride volvo low rider damn how low can you go bro oh we are now at solely charging at the v2 superchargers and oh yeah we're getting 169 amps the battery is in perfect temperature it needs to be minimum 25° c so it's yeah and we're getting 58 kilow i think this is um maximum the reason why we don't get over 60 right now is because the voltage is slightly lower than optimal but yeah man classic ionic for the win the only concern i have is uh let me get some light here uh once i plugged in i realized let me see uh there okay i was um is this going to work well it's just the outer shell that is a bit uh damaged i don't know what the heck happened here maybe it was too cold and the thing froze and then it cracked i don't know but okay so uh man yeah so far so good with the classics oh that's the the volvo that we passed by earlier that that is low rider man oh i don't know if that stuff is legal even how low it is is z it's oh he's actually norwegian okay okay let see how it's going now so yeah okay i need to tell you guys i we we will i have to double check but but beyond this point there is a uh the e6 is closed and we have to take a detour and i don't want to deal with that so we will probably just turn around here and then head north and then we just do an extra loop back and forth uh we skipped 60 km here so i also have to try to calculate distance eror and such but okay but okay let me show you how yeah this man the interior light is so bright and then um let me let me show you guys in the back you know trunk light in the classic ionic is not that great well apparently not anymore let it be light uh we have extra light there and there this is just from ebay we have three extra light on the top there the orig original light is only this so now it is so nice and bright here yeah okay let's close it oh yeah now we taking 61 62 kow oh the this is the cool battery fan status only fans hasn't started yet because the battery is not that hot so uh we will try to avoid rapid gates okay if you look here the distance 11 14.7 according to google it's supposed to be 117 116 so this car under distance by 1% well it could be 1.1 but let's say 1% that means we have to go to 990 km yeah so uh the dour starts right can you see it right south of us that means we'll just head north then and then we go some extra loop in the north yeah you can hear the fans now it it is at the fan speed 2 i think s was the max so it started cooling a little bit to try to keep the uh temperature not too high yeah 63 kw now you remember that you know versus other cars in this era they are charging at only 50 kw we have some uh i3 you know some bmv some uh well eolf they're charging even slower so this is so awesome compared to the other cars so here's a ninja trick don't run hbac while you're charging because the the inlet for the uh cooling air cool battery is there between the back seats so well maybe 40° was not the rapid gate point i wonder if it was 45° because you see here we're still taking maximum speed it's 41° cus max now and we still replicating and battery f str is now four but we are about to throttle well actually it will throttle at 77% this is just insane how fast it charges but okay so next stop if i can get there i think i should be able to get there is going to be so k bate i could fail up before also but no big deal so since we are done over over 100 km now it means that we have to go only 94 km stretches was a 96 before we were done okay it started throttling at 77% we are still not rapid getting yet this is simply amazing but we're going to disconnect soon because soon once we hit 82 is going to drop to 25 kw and then we have to get out of here all right we're back on the the road so we charge for 19 minutes and 24 seconds getting 20 kw hour that is 62 kw average before losses let's say close to 60 kw average into the battery then huh insane yeah but now the battery is at 45° c it is cooking no it's not cooking fan speed is 7 maximum it's trying to cool down the battery all right all is good now we hammer it we are now at wham or and we have to bail out we have three km of range left turtle mode is on wa can you see anything on that now you can see maybe yeah and uh we're going to go to the m charger but look i'm going to floor it oh okay we have power limit oh let's not try to run the guard come on come on we just have to get over to burger king here whatever yeah oh yeah we're now at burger king the m chargers over there delta oh yeah we came with 3% let's see the voltage is a bit low you see here charging voltage we are at the maximum current so well actually 57 kw i'll take it but now you see fan already kicks in now from the beginning so we just want to stay below 45° so we don't rapid gates but all good okay you see we are over here right now and i figured that the consumption is um is going to be around 220 230 on the motorway stretch here so actually it sounds crazy but um we should go around 80ish kilm stretches only not 100 because we hammer it so that means that the next stop is going to be bolon and that is 75 km away we split it that and that should yield the best uh 500 km challenge time yeah otherwise we have to charge past 83% which means 20 kw maybe to almost 90% just so we can hammer it but you know a general rule of thum if you consume let's say a little bit over 200 wat hour per kilm and you cruise at 120 km per hour you're then consuming around uh 25 uh 30 kilowatt and as long as you charge at uh is see here as long as you're charging at 60 kow you are charging way faster you you are consuming but if you still consume 25 30 kow and you only get 20 kw then that means that um you should either drive slower or you should unplug and and charge more often well look look wait how is this uh there is okay lo here um the owner he has done some notification he has changed the struts here so that it stays up normally you will have to where is it yeah there there you know so you changes thr so it goes up and there's an aftermarket frank let me see i think there is a ev oasis also i'm going to link to paul paul's youtube he has some uh videos some diy videos uh how he installed the lead bar and some of the other stuff there so you can check it out and uh see yeah you see we can put the cables here huh very convenient and then wait how do i close it just slam it down not sure i think you just have to you know it's not a tesla you can actually bam that if you do that in tesla you don't the h oh we hit 46° c and it actually starts rapid gating we were getting 173 amp flat and yeah over 60 5 kw on the first uh session but now it actually rapid gates but this is a bit weird because when we started charging the cooling went at fan speed 4 they should have cranked it up to six or s immediately because this is bound to happen right it seems uh the bms or the whole system has been poly or okay not poly but not optimized for avoiding rapid gate but it's mean it's just a slight rapid gate but this might cost us maybe 1 minute of charging time so it's not optimal but no big deal and you see that h buug is even off right now and then it should still be nice and cold in there where the air vent is so i'm not sure exactly how it works but in the classic sole it dumps the heat in the trunk you can see the trunk area is not that hot but maybe because there's just so much stuff in here but supposedly this rear quarter becomes a bit warmer so i'm not sure where the heck it dumps the heat but at least here you see that inlet is there yeah it's a bit can you see it a bit hard oh let me see oh sorry there that's the inlet so it's pulling in around 18° c uhoh uhoh 48° what the heck is going on now you see inlet is even 17° and it's rapid gating we should be getting 65 almost 70 kilowatt i don't remember the previous session but yeah fan speed is seven which is maximum you can hear it in the back there all right well well well we at almost 81% 50° c and then fan speed ramped up to eight i didn't know it went that high okay but we we're going to leave soon okay we at 50° c in the battery but look here 68 kilowatt power limit what let me let me check here oh the car feels a bit slower it has rapid gate and power gate at the same time oh this could easily be fixed if uh the car crank up to fan speed 8 or 7 earlier it was just lurking at 4 for the longest time uh okay well i i don't think i uh hyundai cares about fixing plastic ionics it's 513 now and the sun is rising wow yeah the sun has entered the chat oh we are now tongue and we about to plug in we have 9.5 de which is perfect we don't want to go too deep because that introduces more heat but it was running at fan speed 7 for the longest time but you see this time we don't arrive at 41° we arrive at 44° but the weird thing is that it kept fine speed 7 for the longest time right until exited then it slowed down to four for some reason no keep it at seven want to cool down the battery well hopefully we'll see what happens when you plug in but okay hopefully we can avoid too much rapid gate so yeah v4 supercharger for the win oh is it going to work with the classic ionic though because the charge port is a bit tight okay let's try oh yeah we're charging now getting 17 yeah maximum speed but this time instead of starting fan speed at 4 it at least starts at 6 to avoid further rapid gate so okay that's fine we have to go and grab some food now yeah so i need to walk more get some exercise and then we have to walk from the super charger which is over there over to c k that's the only thing that is open right now yeah i realized it's 1st of may it's public holiday so that means less traffic in general yeah that's good uh this is a bit weird normally the c here is always open i'm not sure what's up with today but uh it seems to be closed and normally there would be a dude inside yeah i was h is there something wrong with the door thing no is huh it might be because it's 1st of may public holiday you see there's some building activity here i suspect that's okay they're going to expand the chargers but this is slightly inconvenient because i'm getting quite hungry and everything here is closed burger king is closed cool prick is closed i need to starve this is the if intermitted fasting let's go back to the car uh-oh we're back in the car we are rapid gating um it should be 173 amp we should be getting 65 kw i saw that uh we probably lose 2 minutes with this rapid gate you see but inlet is 20 uh okay let's let me just try something the problem is the inlet not the outlet i believe okay not fine so if you open up all the doors well actually we can just open this it doesn't matter really this is the outlet but we need to get the inlet low it is uh i think around uh maybe uh 5 to 8° outside so if you do it this we get cool air into here which is important i can feel the the draft here and then will this just bring the car out of rapid gate or let it cool faster we're just going to see just for fun oh here has a un boom you see inlet was uh oh look at this it's working it's working we had 20° c inlet now it's 14 we need to cool down the battery schell uhoh it throttles earlier now because you have 50° so 50 seem to be wait i'm not sure if it's 45 or 50° which is the the the rapid gate uh point but you see inlet is 9° all right 50° c and the battery we charged 81 uh it didn't cost it too much time fans spe is eight already but we charge for 23 minutes and we gained uh 20 kilowatt hours so that is only 53 kw average before losses ohoh that is a lot slower than before the first session was the best um okay so um you know just for fun just in the name of science i'm going to keep hck off right now i just want to see does that make any difference at all you know and then it's 5° c outside and you see that inlet is 14 so yeah okay let's see then can we make the run better we just have to cheat ionic bn is willing to do whatever it takes to get the best time yeah remember the abc always be cheating uhoh uhoh windows is stting the fog uh what they do crack open the windows uh i'll keep them shut for now actually no i can crack open on the windows yeah yeah we need to get rid of the the moisture but then we also cool down the cabin oh yeah so here's a trick we have seat heater on one we have a steering wheel heater on and then we have a rock off then we save energy on hwac while we still have the comfort where it matters and then we cool down the battery oh yeah ancient chinese secret we're are now ro this is going to be the turn r point for the challenge and then uh let me see we have now 334 yeah that's roughly 300 almost 340 km so far but look look so now we have 44° but still f speed 7 and we at 52% this is way better previously we had 44° at 10% it is actually working it is working oh yeah we are back in the game oh we back at the v4 superchargers and yeah look at this we're getting maximum speed now for now okay there seems to be one throttle point at 45° c and then another throttle point at 50° so um yeah now i want to get some food this is the dilemma you see because i'm hungry i haven't had food for many hours now and then su over there which means i have to walk 2 3 minutes actually it takes 3 minutes to walk over there but for the best cooling the car needs to be this no no wa trunk the car needs to be this but i can't leave the car this while i'm gone okay look here we have 10° in the cabin i was actually driving with 15° so now it should be cold enough to keep everything cool while i'm gone for maybe what 6 7 minutes you see i crack open the window and this is perfect uh this is aftermarket installment but it also makes it hard to try to poke into the car while i'm gone and cl i mean the risk of something something happening here is ultra low anyway since we are in norway so we just crack the windows open a little bit and then we what the heck what the heck man this looks so girly and then we leave okay let's go let's go so okay hopefully it's open now man i'm back in the car we have some sandwich there we have yeah okay waffle from s k in nerd pie of fun flu ideally i want the cle w waffle but you see we open up everything again but still inlet is um 11 it rapid gates it seems whatever you do it's going to rapid gate anyway so you might as well get the comfort and just dry with heater on so the flaw was that when we started charging the fan speed was four it should just ramp it up to seven immediately you car was was kind of chilling ah it's fine no it's not fine you're going to rapid gate now i mean no big deal but it would be great to get 65 kw rather than 59 right why back on the road you see 50° all good before f speed8 yeah and this time we average 59 kilowatt oh yeah that is very good okay slight call rapid gate versus the first session but uh way better than previous run so now we're going to go to uh cleavage that would be the last starting stop and then we just have to make a loop and finish this yeah we are now at what 381 so we have uh around 110 km left h right that's it uh we are now at cleage we were supposed to charge here but i turn around i'm heading towards i the d instead because this car is just simply amazing we still have 36 km of range left and 25% left so yeah okay why not uh feel it's a bit too early to stop here even though it wouldn't matter but okay let's go to ion instead then all right we're now at i do oh yeah my second home so yeah we just open up everything so see here's the deal um we need to drive 27 more kilm 28 was it uh i don't remember but that means that i'm going to drive north now to uh just neoness and then i can drive south and then end up at yes home straight home um for convenience i i'm going to do a test right after this or not long time after i do this i'm going to measure degradation so for convenience we will just charge extra so i don't have to go back and forth or visit yet another charger and then i calculated that we need to spend roughly 25% of the battery is we getting close now i'm probably want to have 5% margin so let's say once we hit 30% of the the battery we will time it and count how many minutes x we charge that's going to be the convenient charge and then we do the 9 wait the the 499 yeah all right final run and the way we count is that i stayed 17 minutes extra and uh multiply i mean add everything together we have to take current time minus 2 hours and 40 minutes so we are about to hit the 6 hour mark and we ain't done yet oh i was hoping for less than 6 hours but it seems that is not possible h maybe because the the norway route here slightly [music] slower all right let's do the countdown let me see it's kind of hard to see there 4993 4994 4995 496 497 498 4999 500 consumption wait time 47 we can run down to 6 hours and 5 minutes oh what about what about what about consumption 200 214 wat hour per kil so we have to correct for that also wow that is some impressive oh hats off for ionic hail to the king we are now back at yes home and look we arrived here with 68 there there look look look so we have 44° in the battery fan speed is zero because the contactors are open the car is off and it doesn't want to fire up anything but if i do this fire up the car even if hb is off it will then kick in the car cooling fan speed 2 at least so this is what you can do if you want to cool on the battery faster but there is even a better way which is plug it in so turn off again it will go down to zero not optimal but then wait let me then you plug it in and you see i use this wall e thing here it takes three face and then converts it to to single phas with a bit of losses i suppose but then i get uh 25 amp out of it rather than just getting 16 amp single phas okay but look here you see instead of us instead of getting fan speed two we now get fan speed six oh yeah so now we cool down the battery faster so this is what you need to do a ninja you have to plug it in in order to uh preserve the battery health and then maybe you can if you have something ec you can maybe set down the you can you can reduce the the current maybe uh just to keep the fans running and then you cut the charging maybe after 1 hour because you see it's going to finish in 1 hour and 50 minutes so charging it to 100% also is not optimal if you care about battery health you can do minor tweaks without going too crazy ninja um and that is all good you know i just realized that a 500 km challenge time 2 is not the 1,000 k challenge because we have to you know the route we drive uh we drive south via oslo and then we drive south again north again pass we pass oso twice that oslo stretch you guys know it right it's 80 zone 60 zone 70 zone whatever uh you actually lose some time there especially with something ionic that goes snell and charges quite fast but in the regular 1,000 col challenge you have to pass oslo year or yeah and then you pass you the bu but then you have even 120 zone not quite significant actually the 12 zone is roughly 180 km total where you can really open up and rapid gate no i'm just kidding so it means that that's why the classic ionic in the 1,000 k challenge did it in just 11 hours and 50 minutes and normally it means that you can take that whatever time divided by two and then even slice a little bit more because when you you know the nature of 1,000 km when you start the challenge you already have 100% you can go quite far before you can charge the first time so if we had a more optimized 1,000 k challenge oh i'm sorry 500 k challenge we should be able to do it in just 5 hours and 45 minutes or 40 minutes but that is not the 500 c challenge so just i we just need to understand how it works what i could do is i could not go i could skip oslo and just go back and forth in the in the m route but i kind of created the 500 col and that's how it is but man okay anyway the ionic let's go a little bit closer there's some fan stuff going on there so i'm not sure how loud it'll be but um here here here man the king you know it is so much faster than the other cars yeah eolf and bmv they could just go home you know i bet even people be yeah be i your videos but you should try the 33 kilow hour bmv it's not it's still not going to beat ionic be b you should try the the the fl300 eagl it's still not going to beat the ionic maybe the 42 kw i3 or yeah i don't know what about what about leaf um even the 40 leaf is not going to beat dionic but we start at the bottom here with the oldest cars with a small battery and they will slowly work as our up there but next one out is going to be soul soul with a new battery has almost the same kilowatt hour it just less efficient but it also charges fast and i will also see how it rapid gates uh so yeah and then eventually i want to try to borrow a 30 kw hour so because that so supports supposedly 100 kow on chadu but with the adapter the adapter supports well technically supports 200 kwatt which is 200 amp and 1,000 volt but whatever uh maybe we can see 75 kw on the 30 so we'll see but yeah i just have a lot of fun testing those old cars and this is also awesome yes anyway i think that's going to be it for now hope you guys enjoy this as always thank you for watching and talk to you later",4
Bjorn Nyland,PLqKx2qnB8Xv4rFsIsmw2e1jhYNT-Dux6Z,U3nVGULmocs,"this was brought to you by marcus be elmech a planner stor bik camp power and b componente y what's up we are now getting ready for yet another 500 k challenge you know recently i did it with the classic ionic and this so is the classic sold the 27 kw hour but they got a battery replacement so the new battery actually charges at also the same speed as a classic iic around 60 65 kw and then it has around 24 kw hours so this same battery capacity roughly the same charging speed but it is boxier and less efficient so classic i only did it in 6 hours and 5 minutes i suspect that this time will be around 6 and 1/2 hours we'll see so big thumbs up to lbme for providing me the car and now we're going to top it back up to 100% it's been sitting in the garage let's check out car scanner uh battery is at 13° c all right we will see also if the so rapid gate the same way h that would be interesting yeah okay okay let me see do i need to fire up the car how fast is it we're going to go the regular route in norway okay yeah it's it's fairly quick see there okay okay if i zoom out a bit see we are now at yes home uh okay we'll drive to schwein soon there and then back again and then to uh r and then back again and that will be 500 km challenge so we're going to start any minute now and now it's 8:20 so maybe at 825 then we'll start and before we start i have to show you we have this adapter from ev nicholus it allows us to charge on ccs stations because this car has uh charal but there are some limitation it doesn't work with super charger but at least it works on cem power and uh on altronic hypercharger so this is going to be a game changer because instead of getting 50 kw we'll be getting 60 65 kw okay we have driven less than an hour we're getting close to moss after just 88 km we are down to 18 km of range now and the consumption was 223 w hour per kilometer and we're going to stop now at st i i think i have actually never stopped there to charge for cir okay so the problem is that the adapter has some limitation where it works uh hopefully it will work over there at okay otherwise uh i don't know what we're supposed to well okay the fallback is that if it doesn't work then hopefully there's a ch over there we can use but that it will be only 50 kw so i can see here in cars canan that we are down to 14.5% so what you need to know about these classic all uh korean cars is that the percentage drops fast also gum here initially it seems you can go quite far but towards the end now it drops faster and faster see 16 km of range left 7 km uh to go yeah just don't hammer too hard otherwise you run out of juice okay we are here but we have some problems it shows state of charge which is correct we have been connected but it doesn't output any power so there must be something wrong here i need to restart maybe i'll deduct something i'm not sure it's supposed to work with that patronic okay let's try again okay let's try again you see initially it will start this i did everything as we're supposed to do we connect all the equipment we fire up uh the adapter uh it should do the handshake if this wasn't work we have to fall back to the regular char mode but this is only 125 amp so that is a minus we'll be getting less power the whole point is to use the adapter and this is the only cho all the others they are only ccs so now it doesn't even show up with a state of charge l here so i have checked beforehand al patronic should work and these are the hypercharger al patronic oh come on seems it's not working charging a okay i change plug to this side and now it is working but we are only taking 10 kw what the heck is going on here huh is is it because of the bad cabling or something this is so weird but uh charal should have very good connection so i don't know if there's something wrong with the charger um this is a big mess now in time in uh deduction time uh okay let's try one of the other over there okay first i was here i moved over here try the first plug and then it instantly works but yeah you see i don't know what's up with this but it seems to be a bit unstable wait we're supposed to get well okay it comes now okay yeah hopefully it's stable it should be at 60 kw soon it was just jumping a little bit up and down there there huh jumps a bit up and down that is a bit weird huh maybe i don't know but when i tested the adapter it works smooth but that there was on cam power so i don't know what's up with that but we should deduct some time and then we see how much time we need to deduct eventually with other chargers also but let's check inside the car now at least yeah yeah see this seems more stable you see i 60 kow wow look at that oh o 178 kw that's our amp in in the previous test i saw only 173 amp i never seen that high amps before wow but this was roughly 10 minute deduction but at least we're charging now okay okay so according to google it is 96 km from home to here and the car reports 95.7 so that means that the car reports distance exactly yeah korean precision but m we already at 68% and it goes blistering fast you see here that we are now taking what can you see anything there there 65 kw oh it should take the speed all the way to 77% also same as um classic ionic but the plan now is to drive let me see zoom a bit i'm going to drive all the way to the turn run point and then go here so um if i cannot make it there to su i can bail out a little bit before but the crazy thing is that the classic i only think all started from home but the classic unit went all the way there yeah it could go 20 km longer wow that is the different between the efficiency of these two cars then well we're back on the road again oh there's a slowdown ahead there but uh you see this time i think i won't hammer too hard but uh yeah we are now have 43° in the battery uh oh slow down slow down and then the fan speed is already at seven and then you see inlet is 20° so in the classic ionic the inlet is somewhere between the back seats uh here i heard that the the inlet is uh somewhere in the front here i'm not sure where the heck it is but it is nice and warm outside so that's why i actually don't need to run the heater yet eventually maybe i'll run it but heater just waste of energy and it cools down the cabin i mean it heats up the cabin too much so yeah always be cheating yeah uh keep remember that no fan is better than only fans we're now at spon this is a turn on point and then just as uh double checking it's supposed to be 146 km it is 146 km so distance is correct we are getting close to the charger and man i feel the difference between the so and the classic ionic we have 15 km or gum range left 133% left and i have to slow down uh because we have 8 kilm uh to go but the gum here will drop faster than that so um yeah i have to go slower as i'm losing driving time now versus i mean or driving average speed versus the classic ionic oh well this is just how it is boxy car oh we don't see indicated range left we still have 7% so the car shouldn't shut down now at least it should shut down at 0% 65 but we are still 4 km away the struggle is real the sun has entered the chat even though the sun is not shining we don't have any hw we can turn off there is nothing we can turn off right now we just have to haul in there come on 6% oh don't die don't die i have di with a freaking soul before and i don't have protection with me i have no protection 5.5 5% is he going to go in crawl mode now come on don't die me slow down slow down slow down slow down long up oh 3 km left come on come on you have to make it there this is super scary it drops really fast towards the end now don't want to run out of juice here man oh oh no turtle mode is on oh come on come on okay we made it here but there is a small problem we have hand check problems again so it started charging wait just previous run it started charging but it stopped well hopefully works now but you know what okay first time i tried yes we had handshake problems i deducted for it now i think whenever we get problems i will not deduct any handshake probably seems that the adapter is a bit uh unstable but this is the the name of the game so we uh okay whatever yeah now it's working no more deductions at least not for handshake problems do you guys agree okay okay and then we have to do this because i still haven't figured out where the roost is no but where the where the inlet for the battery cooling is uh is it on this side it is not here in the ionic you see that there is no event what they were here um what is this okay so where is the inlet is it there some people say that it is over here here is i i don't know no maybe but whatever we're just going to open up this let me see maybe open also this okay okay you know what we know what we need to do we need to do this for the thumbnail this and then here yeah i think this is good we get the l there okay charging just suddenly stopped we have to restart this is not deductible time okay let me put on the camera and start restart again the the bugginess man man i moved over here i was over there it started and it stopped whatever we're going to use native chadore for now we'll see from there okay you see this is what you're supposed to get only 120 amp uh 40 kilow the good thing now is that the battery is not heating up that much but well it's not really a an advantage because we have active cooling on a leaf so we are actually losing time now but i just kept lo losing time by trying the adapter that kept bugging which is weird because i i used campire before and it was quite nice so i don't know we had bugginess at al patronic bugginess here actually the last time when the first time i i tried you guys remember at vasp that was also cam power it did bug after 10 minutes and it stopped and restarted again so this is super unstable the adapter man is it even worth it though well is if you stuck and there is no charal available then okay you will probably push through the bugginess just to get some charge done before it bugs again but for a challenge this and what the heck do i do now okay next st is going to be shell o only 58 km from here and you see now it throttles slightly earlier because the battery is hotter the first session was the best session okay time to un disconnect yeah unplug and we can see here now now we you see now the the speed plummets yeah now you really want to go only 15 kw now all right we're back on the road again so we charged to i don't know a little bit over 80% but i think from now on well actually i'm not sure how far we're going to drive uh charge because uh it seems rapid gate is not that big of a problem problem it's only 48° now but fan speed is still 7 yeah so okay we're going to drive another 50 km to the charger but um i think i shouldn't slowpoke too much yeah i still need to go fast enough otherwise i'll be losing average speed we are now at vu this is a bit weird because we are not by the motorway i draw well it was just one minute though about a minute of detour away from the motorway it's going to vol bike panel you know it's not that far off and then i got lost a little bit over there before i found out that it's here but okay let me explain this is eon clever and we are charging now on charo look at that 61 kow oh and we charging on native 200 mccs sumi wait whatever okay electric but this charger i mean this this plug you see it's thick than the regular cho so this is a few places in norway at least where you actually have 200 amp so i don't have to dig around with the adapter and it actually works here at cleav it is kaput last i treding it so as usual i will open up everything and one thing i noticed is that this sole seems to have worse cooling than ionic so even after driving for a while it cools down really slow we arriv at 45° and it actually it's right about to w gate now um i don't know what else to do i didn't drive that fast i even drove slower than ionic the consumption wasn't that high even but for some reason it seems the air cool system here is inferior is worse it pulls in somewhere i'm not sure the fan is running what was the fan speed again it's running at fan speed six at least and then it dumps the heat oh i can feel the heat here let me dig it out to take out a bunch of foam and some stuff and some covers and then it looks this and you see there's a fan there and it is quite hot the outlet there is around i don't know where it's claims huh 25° yeah i when i put my hand there i can feel it's nice and warm feels almost 30° c but clasic ionic was different there was something that went here and then out and classic iic dumps the heat out to the inside of this part here and this part becomes warm but here it dumps it in the car which is kind of nice in winter but in summer uh i'm not sure but by the end of the day it also depends on the inlet right and then can we try to find where the heck the inlet is if we just poke around with a thermal camera can we see anything here can i see anything here i'm not sure where the heck the inlet is okay but we have to oh oh oh oh look at this we're still getting 60 kow oh we're still kind of in the game but i have to get some food now yeah i'm starving man okay i grabbed some food at the gas station we are now at 77% it's about to throttle we should leave now but it's getting hot in here holy crap and you know okay let's try this just for fun just the ionic but it's different here we're going to have the this stuff here until the next starting stop i think it's going to be cleage and we just leave it open this wait can we oh wait can we open up even more come about there this is good enough and then me see if this makes any difference on the cooling or not yeah remember to abc always be cheating okay we're on the move and we have 51° c in the battery oh oh battery cooking all the windows are open i'm just going to keep them open for a little bit just to try to empty out the heat here i still have no f f on not even only fans and then we're going to do this in the name of science yeah just the ionic man this korean cars oh oh i just noticed because the battery is so hot we have power gate we have 56 kw power limit and the fan speed is eight it goes to eight just classic ionic we now in nebon that was the first try it fail it it seems it almost started and then it fa so how many times how many times do we try this before we give up try again i mean it's relatively fast so maybe if we can just get the lucky run that'll be good okay let's try again we have to plug it in first show the rfid activate the the charging so it's ready then when it says hold the p okay then i hold and activate it and i see it blinking it seems cam power is relatively fast to handshake i have another option which is al patronic further down there just 100 m down the road but if this keeps failing come on we see 8% here we see is it is it because of bad it is ramping up now hopefully that's good but when but when does it fail again then who knows who knows you see oh yeah oh it is rapid gating but slight rapid gate we need to cool down this okay open open up open up we open up everything open up here open up here especially here maybe or i'm not sure if it helps that the outlet is running and then here and here yeah so here we go yeah the sun has entered the chat but let me show you mesta they have an electric truck it's charging on cam power let me see what kind of spe they're getting oh it's at 100% wait when did it finish 100% it's blocking the charger oh it stopped the freaking charging stopped oh i mean how many times do you have to do this okay let me give it a try and one more try let's see now i can show you the process i'm just going to put it on the dashboard kind of this is wait okay whatever it's a bit off but so it it goes rel fast to restart it so you take off the adapter i don't think you even need to put it on the holder yeah you're supposed to put it back there and then you do then you connect it to the adapter and then maybe i need to get a more stable position it's kind of you need to this okay and then show the come on come on come on how many times do we have to try here before we just revert to the slow uh char more wait oh start it is a bit clumsy that you have to start it but this is a real world case where i'm trying to use the adapter and then you know a a regular people they were just okay plug in oh it works yes okay and then they go to the gas station and then after half an hour they come back and huh it stopped after 5 minutes uh it charged only 10% before it stopped you know but i have to sell tell you that i don't have the latest software it's a f firmware but the the latest firmware doesn't include any critical ultra uh thing that i need so i haven't had time to update it you have to connect it to the pc and then do a little thing um yeah okay so we are running again oh man the charging bugged again i tried to handshake it failed i tried to handshake again it failed the car is off by the way uh it seems after a couple of tries with recharge i mean with the camp power once it fails a couple time it just fails to work or i don't know maybe adapter uh so now we are on native chadal yeah getting only 42 kw uh wait someone's calling me oh okay uhoh uhoh we are replicating we should leave now you see even at 75% we're taking only 30 kow because the battery is cooking i don't know what else to do i try to open up as much as possible but it's raining so then i had to close again but okay i have a plan though okay let's go oh yeah nice weather over tongue at least so um i will not drive too fast uh because i don't want to overheat the battery it seems with this challenge overheating the battery becomes a problem suddenly but also the the buggy adapter okay i i think from now on i will only use uh native chal so the next stop is going to be a delta charger and ninja trick with the delta charger is that they actually supply 133 amp the other plugs that you've seen in the past they usually give you 120 125 amp so you're getting a little bit more speed but we have lost so much time on the handshake problems that it would have been better if we only ed 50 kw native all the way well okay um and you see here time now is 13:36 we count as if we started at 835 so we are now at the 5h hour mark and we are only at 350 km uhoh this is going to be uh a lot worse than the ionic oh this is weird we are now at the m charger delta and well we are not getting 133 amp we're getting only 123 amp what uh okay but i mean we are rapid gting but still even in this rapid gate state which we get uh for 59 kw so um okay the plan now is to charge just enough we have 18% now we're going to charge just enough to get over to ro huga because over there we have the ufc charges 200 amp native just previous uh yeah okay and then we'll see what we do from there so it's kind of this is actually a very messy challenge you see we drive only 16 km for the next charging but it is 19° outside oh no i open open up everything again you see we do it this but right now there is not that much to cool unlike the the ionic run so i i mean not much cool it is too hot outside you can imagine if it's um uh if it's 30° outside how much will this thing rapid gate then uh it is 20° outside and it's 22° inside so i just crank up the hb now 15 degrees in the inter in the interior we are not spending extra energy to cool down the cabin but hopefully also to cool down the c uh the battery i don't know if this helps uh we'll see in 8 km at uh yeah ruga we are now at ruta charging up getting 55 kilow oh yeah we are back in the game kind of we look here inlet so what i'm going to do now this is kind of counter intuitive maybe for some some cars is that i'm going to run hck at come on climate okay okay 15° cool down this i don't know where the inlet is but we need to cool it down and then let's see here okay but okay let's let it wait way to work but man there is uh some kind of fossil car uh event going on there plenty of noisy fossil cars here ton of them what the heck man it's so smelly it's so is see oh okay let me show you go outside a bit yeah it's nice and warm there's some tesla charging here is just so noisy h vol and stuff yeah i think this is not an ev event is is some kind of fossil event okay anyway uh let's see now did it oh let me clos oh it did help it did help it was it was 21° it's it's now 20° the bly in the inlet should drop now so we're trying to cool down the battery this is the way to do it if you want active cooling of the battery you have to run hwac i think the koreans they designed the car to run hwac and they expect that you're going to run this in korea when it's 25 30° outside and then of course you're going to run the hrock and then you cool down the battery oh but we're almost done now we are just past the 400 km mark so we have to do 100 more but when it com to time what we're getting close to 6 hours in 20 minutes that will be 6 hour mark uhoh uh we are now taking 29 kw what the heck happened here 51° c but i have 17 i i run the hck on full blast i even recirculate i tried everything now just to cool down the car uh cool on the cabin actually it was cool on the car cool on the car and you cool on the battery yeah i already put the gu is bugging me i already put the air flow to down i put manual see how mold i put it on the there to direct the air flow down and you can see that inlet has dropped now to 17° but it seems it ain't enough we are rapida a leaf what how is this possible to replicate a leaf and it's only 19° outside side oh okay there's one ancient chinese secret i have to split in in more charging stops just tr to charge more often okay let me figure out something okay now we're going to use the ancient trick that i use with leaf is that if you rate what you need to do is just to charge more often because we had good charging speed initially before it uh became too high too hot so you see it is working 15° here and this is the setting you have to use so just at work the air low and maximum speed but you have to go manual otherwise it won't be that great and then you see 15 here so hopefully this will drop soon this is the problem this is the one that causes us to get only 30 kw okay i don't know if this is going to be the last or the second to last charting stop but we are now at cam power uh m uh right now at this point we don't care about 200 amp because the battery is rapid gating so bad that wait h what the heck happened there it was 52 it was 50° now it suddenly dropped to 48° but you see at this point we we charge slow because the battery is too hot so even if we had 200 amp available we wouldn't be able to get it anyway so all right uh i have to take a little uh b stop here and then we'll find out yeah this is what i do now when we are charging okay and then i have to find out where we'll stop next but this is saturday afternoon so there's more traffic here more people charging so i have to figure out where to avoid the louder sty oh yeah it is working we are maintaining 42 kw that's still better than 30 kw and we are maintaining 48° and 14° inlet and then the the recipe is this yeah 15° on the low there man manual fan and then recirculate yeah ancient chinese secret this is it the final run right now we don't care about the battery temperature we don't what can you see anything there there we don't care about the cooling so i'm actually running hbac on normal levels now so we don't have too high consumption because we have to get to the final point and yeah 50 more kilm and then what's the time so far let me see uh 15 or 7 hours wait we're getting close to 7 hours ohoh uhoh okay let's do the countdown 4999 49 and1 no my bad 49 and zer 49 and2 i'm dripping i'm dripping 49 and3 49 and4 49 and5 49 and6 49 and s 4998 4999 500 consumption 222 time 544 that means 7 hours and 10 minutes oh a slow clap for the rapid gating soul h we are now at the cam power and unlike the i or actually i'm not sure maybe the the battery temperature is too high but uh we are still getting eight fan speed so even when we are stationary now we are trying to cool down the battery so maybe this is what you need to do after a hot lap when your turbo is glowing red no glowing white you have to just idle for 10 20 minutes half an hour until the batter is cooled down uh yeah okay whatever let me just plug in all right all good we're getting 43 yeah you see you see in the you know in more normal condition even with uh regular ch whatever you know we just hit the 125 amp limit anyway even if the battery is soak i mean is soaking hot over there smoking hot we still don't feel the rapid kate so normal uses they don't feel anything they'll be okay there's no indication here on a leaf that the battery is uh very hot so no problem we're back home now i'm going to show you something just classic ionic so works the same you see we have 46° cus in the battery that is not optimal for a battery degradation we want to keep it let's say at 20 at least 30° or lower fan is now running at only two it was running at four earlier so i have a theory why the fan speed uh is going slower when you are driving slower i think it is due to noise they don't want too noisy fan when you're know uh stationary now but once you're on a motorway once the speed is higher then you don't really hear the fan that is my own explanation but uh okay so you see two that's going to take a while to cool down the battery but if you stop the car then it goes down to zero because the contact is open now but if you plug it in so we had fans speed 2 but look okay there's there's adapter here to then make type two into type one you plug it in wait for the handshake and then look what's going to happen now is that it will start charging right one two 3 you can hear it also four five six oh yeah yeah the logic behind it is is that oh now we are connected to land power so then we uh have enough juice to spend cooling down the battery so it seems the car has been pre-programmed to be quite a kind of stingy yeah efficient yeah stingy but then not take care of the battery in an optimal way but anyway maybe i should summarize how well did the car do it well it was actually pretty good for the price remember that this is oh how old is it again around 6 seven year old car and it nowadays it doesn't cost that much it cost roughly the same as an eolf first generation eolf so in that regard the performance is really good okay ionic is better but it's also more expensive but yeah we were lucky to get a free battery rep placement even if we didn't get the the battery rep placement we will still be able to do it in a pretty good 7 hour something run so the the cars i mean people who own these cars they're not going to drive that far at least we're not doing a 1,000 km but 7 500 km is quite far for this car you can go from oslo to stockholm or almost o oslo to um copenhagen that's 600 km so for that price i think it's still pretty good anyway i think that's going to be it for now i hope you guys enjoy this as always thank you for watching and talk to you later",4
Bjorn Nyland,PLqKx2qnB8Xv4rFsIsmw2e1jhYNT-Dux6Z,YiL7a7EIDp0,"this was brought to you by marcus be elmech a planner storing bike camp power and b componente yo what's up we are now at home getting ready for 500 km challenge with bmv i3 this is the 33 kw hour yes you guys requested it we brought it here thanks to elmech volar for the win and then we're going to do it 500 km challenge we done it with the first generation 22 kw hour know and then okay was with but it did it it almost uh in almost 8 hours yeah the first gen i3 battery didn't charge that fast it charged fairly fast to around 50% and then yeah but here the chy curve is a lot better we get maximum speed around 49 kw all the way until 85% and then it throttles so it's way better and initially it has around 30 kw hour net capacity and then now i think it should be roughly at 27 kw hour so we're going to try to beat the ionic classic ion did it in just a little bit over 6 hours can we do that oh let's see then we have a big battery right we should be able to beat the ionic finally so um what do we have here well we just have the sude doors yeah look this okay nothing fancy there and then here yeah okay i think we'll start 6 is the clock there incorrect 618 no it's 617 okay see it has 138,000 km on the odometer wait fire up the car here we have electrified it reports state of health to be 90% and then it claims 90.8 amp hour this was originally a 96 amp hour battery no no wait wait wait wait now i'm a little bit unsure here what was it again was it a 90 i have to google it man um i should remember all these numbers it was a 60 amp hour and then a 93 amp hour i think it was wasn't it yeah yeah i think it was 93 amp hour and then the last one was 120 amp hour yeah freaking ows man who uses that we have live stream up and running so going to do the fin and um preparations and then off we go you guys know the dr 500 km challenge with the beamer oh yeah beamer b is back i was wondering huh why is the fog light on where is the fog light switch where's the fog light where is it uh there's the fog light switch oh oh oh oh oh i see if you want to put the storm back btle there it presses the fog light button i you serious so i cannot use that position i have to use fortunately it has a second position here all right okay let's not drive around with a fog light a typical norwegian niss oh yeah we're on the move entering deep into the cleavage h and yeah we start early it's saturday morning now [music] 6:25 and um yeah i figured out that this phenomena here is actually way off but uh we're going to hammer it yeah even though it's a small battery well small it's battery it charges so fast i done the math that it actually pays off to hammer it you don't want to slowpoke no no no not with the bmv no no you want to go schell yes okay let's go we are now on the motorway it's 110 zone and i'm hammering it yeah remember that the speed is way off but uh you know if you look here well okay earlier we had 189 w hour perometer but it will go up soon but you see in general let's if you have uh to keep it simple if you have 200 w hour per km consumption and you cruise 120 km per hour that is 24 kilowatt average and then let's say no more than 30 kow then when we hammer it as long as you discharge at only 30 kw and you charge at almost 50 kw you know as long as your charging speed is a lot higher than your discharging speed then it actually pays off to hamate if you had a seway with only 22 kw which means around 18 kw into the battery after the massive discharging loss in the camalon charger then you shouldn't hammer too hard but over here with the beamer you should hammer where i forgot beamer okay i have to hug the left lane of course make the test more realistic okay okay sorry guys oh should i used the blinker i should not use blinker we are now at the first starting stop getting 43 k what oh and it's going to go up because uh wait huh current is 120.7 why are we not getting 125 amp okay i'm i'm not sure oh no maybe some cooling is active oh the battery is at 32° cses hh okay but whatever 121 amp roughly i'll take it we're going to get this let's see now how flat is this curve and this is simply amazing ching curve and the car actually went 100 27 km in a single charge uh but i wonder if that is roughly the same as what the classic ionic would go because the classic ionic no i'm trying to do this no no no no it's not touchcreen you dummy you have to use the idrive it's way safer because then you have to twist and press freaking forever before you can do whatever you want to do okay is see uh interactive map the laser cannon wait this one doesn't go diagonally it only goes holy balls okay it's also it's also inverse when you do the zoom in because when you you want to i think in more um uh intuitive way if you go twist this you go in right well if you twist no no it's the other way if it twist this you go out out not in nine n in i think there was a way to reverse the direction here maybe but okay anyway i wanted to show you that uh the classic ion went here but ended up there with 8% yeah we ended up here with also around 8% i think it was but we went a little bit further so oh okay we'll see this is going to be the battle against the the ionic then but how is it going now okay charges a little bit faster look at this oh yeah and then as you guys know it we have k power yeah it's nice to be back with what the heck is this lit i mean the trash bin is right over here i know how stupid how lazy are these ev drivers littering all over the place here well actually you know what they could this could not i mean it could also be non ev drivers fossil drivers who park here yeah okay whatever but yeah you see the camp power has been upgraded actually a while ago it can deliver 800 volt yeah we can take possibly 200 kow you know but we are taking only 50 kow you can see here also for you guys who haven't seen it before this is the cam power interface you can scan this and you can get the charging screen in on your phone in case you have an old car without app but the beamer has app and you can here you can see the charging curve oh yeah okay interesting so we are taking 125 amp from the charger which is the maximum for this car yeah it's just a ccs it's a ccs that only takes 125 amp so oh interesting if you get 125 amp from the charger it means that around 4 amps is lost somewhere which is probably the cooling yeah you can hear the cooling because this battery unlike the ionic battery this battery has liquid cooling the ionic batter is only air cool you know quite primitive yeah in comparison wait what the heck happened here 20 huh 29 kilow what we're supposed to get maximum speed all the way to to 85% and also huh the battery is at only 32° c huh what and you can't wa there is nothing wrong with the charger this c power uh when did that happen you see it claims vehicle limitation okay if it switch language uh how do you switch language there no no english the vehicle is limiting this it's not the charger the charger is more than enough capable to deliver hey what huh what what the heck happened there it had little dip and some and then huh what it happened a minute ago roughly and now we get only 30 kw okay got an idea how much time do we lose by swapping stalls we can try this stall i have to prepare authenticate authenticated okay stop stop the charger a ninja that's the way to swap it we have so long cables that we're get to do a hot swap almost so how much time did we lose there maybe 30 seconds of charting time okay i look at the time we uh charge slow it was 7 minutes plus some handshake and ramp up and what they were swap so um i think it's fair to say that we lost 5 minutes of uh of charging time total me what they were the conversation was 5 minutes yes the guys in the live stream agree so um uh here you see this is what it should be 47 kw yeah it's going to be even faster now towards the end so we just go for around 80% 85% maybe oh there's a throttle there's a throttle at 83% spot on the guys in the liv stream said 83% yeah there you go so i just to see now past 83% uh how slow does it go cuz you still want to ride on some of it before you unplug maybe wait until it drops below 30 kow before you unplug oh oh 26 kow now okay now it's time to leave oh yeah we're now heading north and i'm listening to some nice music in the harman cardon system oh consumption so far okay so far so good yeah let's keep hammering it wait what sh we are getting close to vestby and and the circle of range is shrinking now we are 11 km away we have 21 km gum and we have 16.6% left so yeah this should be this should be good i charged 90% on the previous stop and it seems it was necessary we are now at shell o first i tried this charger with the rfid it failed handshake on both plugs i tried them and then i successfully started here first it wouldn't work with the rfd maybe rfd really is kut but then they started charging but only getting 110 amp i want to avoid these old charges because they tend to be that instead of supplying 125 amps and now try here via the app it just spins and spins wait can you see just spinning uh it fail handshake yeah again uh i have to du some time this is clumsy at least for cam power it did work immediately uh let's try that charger then we have a few more test let tries now before we uh uh we can't give up okay at least we are charging now so here's a deal we are charging at around 38 39 kw versus uh 42 43 kw 44 whatever so i calculated that to go from uh 7% to u what was again 7% to 83% where it throttles it takes half an hour in normal session and now it takes 32 minutes roughly so we just correct 2 minutes there and then also i have lots of handshake problems tried various chargers so the total deduction time over here is 20 minutes normal people wouldn't do this but i'm doing this because i want to go for the fastest option okay anyway now i can go to the restroom and chill here for about half an hour is i bought some lunch and you see the space here in the bmv has been designed so you can put your burrito there yeah and maybe some bread also look at that that oh yeah nice base all right we're on the move so next stop is going to be nebes yeah that's 90 km away from the previous charger so uh what is the time now it's 10:00 in the morning and it is already 22.5 de it's going to be even hotter so we have at least the hot advantage just hope that it doesn't get too hot there i charge to 87% this time i think that's enough to get over to nez nice hammer music always hug the left lane uh uh we are now getting close to m soon you see nees was over here we already passed neoness and now i'm wondering if i should even skip m and go for esa whoa okay we are 18 km away from espa car claims 27 km we have 20% left i think we can go for it man ooh man the bammer when you drive slow through oslo it becomes really efficient okay this is great this actually a good advantage we can reach esa uh i just realized that that was not espa i navigated to it shows up at espa on the map but that was strongly this is esa we have navigated too 16 km away we have 21 on gum i think it's time to switch over to not comfort what what wait where is it ec eco pro plus has been engaged now we are serious let's sweat we are now jing at espot we came here with 2% left and you see this is what it should be 125 amps boom 43 k 44 kow this is the classic camp power site the old the godfa the old father yeah the first camp power site that was uh installed and then uh look now they have payment paid there uh you can you can choose to pay with card directly if you want to okay nice nice day over here oh so this is it this ching stop and then one more and then we are done d so now we have to figure out what to do over here and then look at the look at the bimmer huh do you this do you this it is actually quite good for what for not what for 500 km challenge or back in the car we have 49% now taking 45 kw so you see now i run only fans you can have with an ao but you don't turn on the ac here and it seems to cool sufficient so we have 215° outside so let's check now in the thermal camera what kind of temperature do we get here huh 8 18° really 20° where do you get that temperature from if it's 21 outside uh i hope it's not running the ac because i don't want it to run the ac for for cabin i mean it's still fine now you see 20 what about dashboard area oh 42° oh yeah what about here the re circle the the yeah recycle dashboard yeah 41° oh that's hot but we have to check also here that the battery is at oh it's bit uh there battery is at 34 de csus it's not overheating yet i think no it shouldn't overheat as long as we don't steal the ac okay back on the road still nice weather outside ooh some clouds but over here 23.5° c we char to 90% it took 36 minutes yeah now i see the difference between i3 and ionic but okay so you know we count with all the deduction we count as if we started at 747 so we are now at the 4our mark and we have done 360 km it also measure that this car measures the distance correctly so we we will actually count to 500 km so all is good yes all is good now we hammer it always be hugging the left lane hmer now okay back here but we're actually going to skip yeah i forgot we're going to skip cter the car has amazing range we can go to tongan instead and even we could even go back to espa that's madness man this is it the last charing stop we are now at tongan and you see 446 we have to drive only 64 more wait no 54 more kilm wo that's it so um yeah we are now getting 120 amp okay whatever uh i'm running only fans here yeah to keep it not over hot so yeah i think this is the best deal and i can show you that what you should do is here you see the charging spots are technically here right why why are the two different uh icons here i'm not sure but you want to plug in from behind because then you get the sun in the back and then the front of the car doesn't become over hot so yeah this is the way to go ancient chinese secret wait let me check the temperature yeah let's do that check the temperature and dashboard now okay let's see now we have well it's still 40° over there the dashboard area but uh at least over here it's 20° wow wow and then only fans is pushing in what 13 oh okay i think this is remaining coolant in the system yeah but usually if i have ac on it should be at 5 or 10° c but you can see well no now it reports 18 19° c okay all is good 1246 yeah i made a blunder last time i mentioned the time it was of course at the 5 hour mark not the 4h hour mark but there we are now at the 6h hour mark and we reached 50% we're good to go yeah let's go all right final run m is nice and calm let me see oh yeah yeah look at that some wind not not much wind which is good because this car is a bit boxy outside temperature 23.5° wait can you see anything there there oh yeah but wait we have 49 km range and 44 km destination oh uh wait did i did i miscalculate or or or maybe gum has been adjusted now for the hammer speed yeah yeah yeah that could be it okay let's do the countdown 4990 4991 4992 4993 [music] 4994 4995 [music] 4996 4997 4998 four 9 n n 500 time 1315 that means 6 hours and 28 minutes so we have to round it up to 6 and 1/2 hours it's 25 minutes slower than the classic ionic oh and it's even warmer than the classic ionic run okay now i have another problem i have 6% left of juice and i still have to drive another 8 kilm to home 8 km oh i have seven kilm of range sher h h i can't make it who suddenly the cruise control was deactivated because it was raining yeah i can reactivate now but the car is quite sensitive for low sun and rain and because it doesn't have a radar it's vision only tesla i thought oh it's the end no it's not the end we have 5% left 5% left i'm going to bail out yeah you want to bail out now i'll just pull out over there soon don't don't don't want to risk it not with old batteries this you know anything could happen oh oh yeah i'm getting 43 kw look at this super consistent look at that the batter is resting at only 29° c no rapid gate no cold gate no punishment point this car is just super consistent the the the slowdown we had in the first session that was probably due to some weird hiccup in the c c power stuff because you saw that on the other stops plus the one we have now also c power no problemo yeah and then of course when you had those old ab charges we had some handshake problems and but at least with camp power or something more modern then no problem speaking of the devil classic ionic we still couldn't beat it what can beat the classic ionic how about 44 no again 42 kilow hour i3 maybe that will'll be able to beat classic ionic so yeah you guys see now that yeah at least we we managed to beat uh the soul oh yeah uh until the soul is back with the adapter yeah the adapter has been updated so it's more stable now and okay i'm talking about the ch adapter for soul and lea and now it's a port supercharger iist that yeah the souls revenge but yeah let me see are yeah we fine you see i only need to top up for a little bit one a minute or two and then i can get back home so don't try to risk it don't try to just get back home and then you run out of juice with an old i3 it doesn't look good you know but yeah so which car is next okay we don't care about the soul nobody cares about the soul but what about the fl300 eolf i'm talking about how about that huh 35.8 kw hour it still has no no thermal management it's going to rapid gate yeah i think that's the next one we're going to slowly build up now the tension and then eventually i have to try also 30 kw hour leaf oh yeah and then slowly we get the better and better car but see i have some criterias these cars should be less than 50 kw hour they should be more than 5 years old and then i don't know what else um no more than 500,000 km maybe or i don't know we trying to it's we're trying to test something that is relevant for people and if you want an old car old ev how good are they for the c3 they are fine but what about long trips well that's what this test shows and 500 k is still relevant it's roughly oslo to stockholm oslo to or oslo to malmer roughly you know or maybe paris to hilton no i'm just kidding paris to brussels maybe so yeah so it's still relevant test and then the beamer actually did it quite well oh yeah al is good well anyway i think that's going to be it for now i hope you guys enjoy this as always thank you for watching and talk to you later",4
Bjorn Nyland,PLqKx2qnB8Xv4rFsIsmw2e1jhYNT-Dux6Z,nPlUcyzPhvw,"this was brought to you by marcus be elmech a planner storing bike camp power and be component yo what's up we are now at home getting ready for a 500 km retest with kia soul so this soul has a new battery it was replaced on warranty but uh since last time we also now have some uh cooling hacks so um maybe i'll come back to you more about what's going on but i can show you now initially what's going to happen so um so has air cool battery and then under here well it's kind of hard to show now voli from elb he has rewired or reh hooked some whatever was air vent going to the back there is now going into the battery instead on both sides and then we have this box here the emergency box well it is a bit big it doesn't have to be that big it's just for it's that big but with this box we can then uh command the the car to run fan speed on nine which is maximum so with these two tricks and another one here this is the adapter from ev e nicholas can you see it even oh there kind of yeah there's a link in the description where you can get 5% discount it's kind of expensive but it is really good now it has turned to be a lot more stable now with this adapter you can charge on ccs yeah this car has chable and we can actually get pretty fast charging around 60 65 kow so i'll just keep it close here in close proximity and yeah with all this stuff and the new update with the hard with the cooling hardware stuff here we should be able to go a lot faster than before so the record on this kind of half challenge you know the half of 1,000 km challenge is uh 6 hours and 5 minutes that is classic ionic and then the second best is actually bmv i3 33 kw hour that was um um uh 6 and 1/2 hours but then this last time we did it with a so it did it in 7 hours and 10 minutes but i think there are a lot a lot of potential to be a lot better because we can charge faster we can avoid rapid gate overheating and what else we can actually use it up the last time i actually have to use the 50 kilow cho so yeah and then this time i also checked on aed r planner aed planner estimates that it's going to take 6 hours and 40 minutes but that's okay but let's say 6 hours and 35 minutes then when until we count to 9 and n and also a b r estimates that is we will spend 233 w hour per kilometer let's see then i don't know i haven't done the ninja calculation but i have a b the ro planet premium and it actually takes in account weather temperature speed limit uh i don't remember yeah you can customize if you have different rims if you have a roof box you can it can actually do estimation really really accurate so anyway um let's get ready for the challenge i maybe i'll use a b roof planet to help me estimate but normally i would just do a n trick so here what is kind of important is that we start recold battery ideally want to start with even call the battery but this is the best we can do so we're going to talk about battery temperature a lot during this challenge but uh yeah we also have live stream running i think we'll start in 1 minute 2350 we will start are we on the move now in oslo and um you see i cannot use automatic on hb because then it will uh fire up the the uh the events towards the bottom there and that it's the bottom that is connected directly into the batteries i actually have to use this manual mode this and now we get some okay heat in here and yeah otherwise it will it will actually input hot air into the battery which we don't want but it's a small hack still nice comfort in here so right now the consumption is 218 hour per kilm we will as usual go for the south loop first and then go back north over here we're charging now and you see we're getting oh is it no it's ramping up but okay this is no now you have to do this okay we flick okay what was it battery done battery is two we flick this it becomes blue wait a couple of seconds oh yeah nine let's go and then also another thing that is important we go here start the car but then you have to go to climate here and then lower the temperature and then go to mold here let show you better here we have to go to this mold and then lower the temperature and then fan speed doesn't have to be crazy high this should be good enough and then we don't actually need ac because it's only 11° c outside and then the inlet here will drop it's 22 now it should drop to around 15 only we need to cool down the battery in time yeah but the car has been programmed to be kind of lazy and ramping up but we just going to go aggressive here without actually sacrificing too much because you see since we are now not using ac we only pulling outside it just runs a couple of hundred watts extra uh we don't sacrifice too much of the charging speed but we can still cool down the battery in yeah this starts dropping oh yeah party time and the reason why i stop here is that it cost only one nuke per kilowatt hour it's dir cheap to charge here it's uh around uh 9 cents per kilowatt hour so uh no wa no uh yeah roughly there so uh let me see how long we jing here oh look at this okay i'm going to come back to that but you see i this location uh i think it used to be some fossil pumps has been removed and now we have more chargers that's another so yeah they have uno x they have quite lot of low price now because of um to the france and there supposedly some they are sponsoring someone who is leading so i was okay i'm going to get the cheap we're going to see how cheap we can make this also if it's possible if it doesn't uh ruin the the challenge time too much then we should try it it's more realistic test right and also that they have card payment see here i'm not registered i just use card and very convenient so you know that um ron group is quite big group that owns many businesses they own 7eleven they also own r matus and i don't remember when all the businesses but it means that ron already owns this ground and then they can just slap down their own chargers just st k is doing right now so you know it's a matter of time before all the gas station chains they realize that they have to offer fast charging uh but also that means that ron they they're already sitting on nice locations this right by the highway and then also we'll see if we can visit some of those but okay let's go back to how it goes with the car now so the downside with this solution is that it can get a bit cold in the cabin oh we have 18° in the inlet now yeah but we are still maintaining nice speed look at that 64 kow oh wow man awesome okay now i'm going to hang out and chat with the live stream people a bit okay according to our the ro planner um we are 62 km away from sh swon and i need to spend okay from i need to spend 60% to get there i have 82 83% now it start throttling so we can leave i'm going to check outside how long we charge here 14 minutes oh now it's slow 15 kow we want to go now okay so you can do the stopping here but the adapter actually allows you to stop charging just by pressing here and then it stops okay let's go all right we're on the move again and you see now we start uh with hot is battery right from this leg and the cooling is running so the trick is that if you look here uh if i go to climate here we have this setting here only fan 15° and we actually getting pretty good cooling and then you can also see here if you go out the climate here that we are not pulling anything for a for clim even know it's kind of weird but it's ac is not running heater is not running but it just pull some electronics what they were extra 100 ws for the fan to run uh for internal and also for uh yeah in the back there and then you see that it's still blue so we are running at 9 so actually let me check here fan speed is nine down there if i turn off the box i want to see what the car wants to run it at um 7 okay huh interesting but we want to run it at 9 cu see here that um we are pulling 39 uh oh i mean 309 watts for electronics uh but if i switch off the thing here z it will drop i have to wait for this to drop there four so the car wants to run it at four right now given the battery temperature and you see that the it dropped to 340 wats wait so that means that if you flick on the swit switch again here okay wait for it um look at this one after a couple of seconds should go up again three yeah yeah see so it seems that higher fan speed from 4 to 9 cost 50 wat extra the car is being stingy i mean 50 wat yeah willan should equal to around5 wat hour per kilm so it literally dro in the ocean but yeah the car has been programmed to be stingy but uh we just want to go maximum cooling uh so that's that's awesome man and also yes as you see that the inlet is 16° but we are not running any ac so we are just getting free cooling 12° outside it's wonderful maybe this is the best time to run it at night when it's cold outside uh we were just at the shell right now trying the hypercharger and the display claim that the plug was kaput so okay whatever we're going to go to kemp power instead over here fortunately have plenty options we on norway uh well i could go for the altronic also but let's just go for camp power so that should work everything is closed here we have to deduct a couple of minutes this is charger fault uh quite unfortunate and also quite rare i never seen plug this goa so uh we try one of these okay here let's go l oh you get free bun oh okay let's try again we with charging now we had to deduct 5 minutes so we are still taking 61 kw yeah the voltage is a bit lower that's why but it should go to 65 kw but eventually this will hit 45 46° c and we rapid gate but i have forced f speed 9 and just before i can show you here we are using this setting which works best for cooling but it gets a bit cold in the cabin so i wonder if i open up the trunk if that will give me some heat um yeah without messing up the cooling and yeah so let's try because here this if you open up here you see that what kind you have to dig kindor for okay down here we have the fan i have to get get it out first okay i cleared up everything the trunk is this so there is some hot air coming out here so the idea is that if i close this and i put all the trunk stuff in the back here i should get a little bit of heat from the back thrown into the cabin and then because the air vents are blocked the regular air then the cooling should not be reduced you know so maybe this is a it's a a poor man's octav valve which is that we are now scavenging heat from the battery into the cabin but then we're pulling in fresh air from outside to cool down the battery it's it's the pool man's tesla man it is a bit noisy from there yeah normally the cover i mean the trunk stuff covers and blocks a lot of the noise and now you can hear the full intensity of fans speed 9 but i have some storm bag i mean just a stor bag container and spork i brought some food with me from home so i don't want to uh i don't want to get uh sick from uh bad food poisoning what there is just a little bit of carada i'm not sure what the heck it's called carate or here we have wait bar huh what think is that bar coa okay let me try it some kind of non original coke how does it taste you know i was a ikea today ikea i mean and has on dispenser coke it wasn't real coke this kind of tastes dispens coke it tastes similar to regular coke but just has a little bit different taste maybe yeah i'm not sure how to put this but it's still a good uh a good substitute the poor man's coke yeah i'm driving the poor man's cars i have to drink poor man's coke oh we're rapid gting it's about to be 172 amp all the way to 72% so yeah we lose a little bit uh we lose maybe a couple of kilowatt it's not that bad i'm guessing maybe 3 to 5 kilow so because the battery temperature is high but we had headwind on the way here consumption is high so hopefully on the way north now we get tailwind and lower consumption and then we get out of the rapid gate uh the charging stopped but i quickly reconnected but this is not deductible time since this is the name of the game the the in slight instability of the adapter causes this to happen but i see that the adapter now is way more stable at le so oh and i have to fire up this very important we have to get because now the car is pulling wait it's still 7even it's on 9 what yeah no no okay so this means that it's pulling but then we also the push push and pull to get the best cooling effect yeah we still need to charge not a little bit more until we are done wow i just realized this car has done 110,000 km now but okay anyway i have some good news and some bad news the good news is that this trick is working so in the back we should be getting some heat some free heat you see here inlet is still 16° even with h even with ac off we're getting that oh but the bad news is that the battery is already at 50° c it start replicating it throttles earlier than before so i think we just have to leave now we don't want to camp on this speed too long we are done now so we charge to 80% and also when you look at the time with the deduction we are at the 2hour mark and we have done only 148 km but of course we charged but yeah so the battery is at 51° c oh it's hot so we have to see now if the inlet stays low so now we can get a little bit of heat because it is coldish outside 14° c i don't want to freeze through the night so one thing i also need to do is that i don't want to hammer too i mean hammer too hard means that i don't want to output too much power because that will generate more heat in the battery and it is a bit hard to get rid of it i mean it's still better than leaf but air cooled battery uh doesn't seem to have the best heating and cooling capabilities uh we are getting close to the next charger which will actually be the yx soon again but um we're down to 15 uh 14.5 uh% now and the battery is still hot you see it takes forever to cool down the battery plus that when we hammering it it adds heat to the system but you have to choose do you want to slow poke i'm doing now kind of and arrive slower or do you want to rapid gate but i think it still pays off because you still lose significant time if you go too slow versus if you just okay you rapid gate but you take a little penalty maybe you charge 1 minute slower and that's still a better deal so we're going to see now you know at 5 km we'll arrive with the charger okay we are charging uh first time attempt it fail handshake but i don't deduct for it because this is the name of the game with the adapter at least second time it works but oh we getting only 53 kow because you rapid gating oh man uh well okay i mean 53 kw that is still fairly fast so just to see how long we can keep that speed then okay see i'm going to try to get the help from alberto ran again we are here at soon and i want to stop at the ches mos another uno x with almost free charging uh but that is 67 km away we have to pass through oslo so if you do this you know a better the ro estimate we will spend 601 % so maybe we spend that maybe more i'm not sure but um right now okay we see here that it seems we hit equilibrium where we get around 55 kw and the battery doesn't go up at least it just oh a little bit oh oh oh oh uh what can we do inlet is 18° maybe it's too maybe it is too hot in here okay i might need to cover up yeah i might want to move all this stuff in the back again and there's freeze a bit we have to sacrifice something for the challenge yeah it it is 10° outside if it's 10° the inlet should not be 18° so there's too much leakage of heat into back into the inlet uh now we have covered everything it should be standard but we replicate oh ideally we should get over 60 kow we only taking 30 kow because the batter is too hot uhoh it seems i i have to drive slower okay i cannot hammer it i have to drive slower yeah that's just how it is because i was thinking okay if i can maintain around 50 kow that's fine but getting 28 now this is really killing it man but okay i did cover in the back i just hope that the inlet can be be better soon come on come on come on what is wrong here no no no not not that i misclicked uh we have to don't go there and then let's try ac okay see if that helps if not then we just turn off ac again actually no no no there's no need we don't need ac when it's 10° outside we are at 68% i'm going to go for 75% you see we lose time here uh in the past we had only around 15 minute sessions this is going to be a lot slower so uh but i i think it's still worth it so yeah hopefully next session will be better and then we'll see but okay in a way i was hammering it and i saved time on travel speed let's say i save 5 minutes and then we're losing maybe 7 minutes here so by the end of the day it's not that big loss all back on the move again it's almost 3:00 at night now and it's getting bright so um this time i cruise at around 117 km/ hour gps speed in 110 so so consumption is not crazy high so yeah despite that it's cold outside so yeah you see the reason why the inlet is a bit high could be because of uh heat leakage the system is not 100% tight so when the battery is quite hot then the inlet is not as as uh low as we have seen before but okay so uh when i did the test a couple days ago i was cruising around 120ish uh in between the legs and it seems to be fine so it seems if you go you know uh almost 10 km per hour faster you hit a bad point where stuff just goes exponentially worse so maybe this speed is the sweet spot we'll see we are getting close to shes mosha and man this is heaven uh it is 8° c outside and we have 46° in the max this is way better than before and inland is 14° so okay let's get over there now just go up the hill now and we will be at ches mosa in 5 km and then it it sounds a bit counter active i mean counterintuitive to plug in at around 15° 15% but that's actually the best deal yeah you don't want to go too deep because then you introduce more heat we are now charging at uno x again oh yeah cheap electricity and we get we are back in the game 45° c is wonderful oh yeah let's see how long we can keep this speed this time then",4
Bjorn Nyland,PLqKx2qnB8Xv4rFsIsmw2e1jhYNT-Dux6Z,GCIDkCOyID0,"this was brought to you by marcus be elmech a planner storing bike camp power and b componente yeah i the concept i mentioned before ron group they own raton and it was um um 7-eleven so this area here used to be just a part of the big parking lot so they were okay whatever they put up chargers here plenty of them we have three hyperchargers 300 kow so that's six plugs and then you can go grocery shopping wa i think is it open i see people preparing they open at 7 oh what the heck okay so it makes perfect sense you char for 15 minutes while your grocery shopping right and then you don't have to worry about wasting time charging so you see i have now open okay here i open up here again yeah so i want to see if it makes any difference this time so we do that we put all the trunk stuff in the back here and then we will see if inlet rises oh no i forgot to i to start the car oh no no no i forgot to start the car okay it's on now yes okay let me just double check climate settings here come on yeah 15° okay oh that's good yeah i'm going to cool down everything next stop is going to be minun that's only 51 km away and then better the ro plan es is that we will spend 50% of the battery and also yeah you see here okay if you it was this but if you on details here you can see that it estimates 237 w hour per kilometer so if i use 50% of the battery now i have 73 that's good we have a margin but you see now it goes slow so yeah we should leave now it's oh 51° again we are now at minun finally charging i had several hand check problems you know if i get one hand check problem uh i usually don't care i don't deduct but this time it was a lot i first try over there it failed several times i move over here failed several times i tried to use direct card payment uh which also failed so i don't know what's up with that because it seems it was about to start charging and then they just stopped so in case it was some kind of payment problem no i don't know what's up with this because we have used al patronic before but it could be that maybe the software that c k uses for some reason doesn't work with the adapter we just happen to use uh let me see i tried al patronic at least i don't know what wors but al patronic that um recharge use that's is fine and also uno x so might be something where be the circ k but i have to then resort to this the native chanal which is charging slower so we have to actually deduct 10 minute of struggling i will do that as an exception but the result now is that we are charging at only 44 kw you see it's limited to 125 amp so this is not good yeah we should have been getting 60 or at least 55 kilowatt so yeah uh not sure what else to say i mean this is the name of the game right next stop is going to be yx c that's 50 km away and then a the ro plan i estimate that i'm going to use 49% so i'm quite confident with 7 2 1% we should arri with 20% even or 15 so just want to get a little bit extra just in case the quarter doesn't work uh but you see here when we charging slower we actually heat up slower but it still doesn't pay off because we could have gotten 60 kow you know or 55 so camping here is somewhat bad but okay whatever so this time we spent only 16 yeah 17 minutes roughly before we leave so yeah let's go we're now in minon and how is m oh oh almost no wind yeah it is now 5 in the morning on a saturday morning this time so we just cruis at 117 gps speed and that should be the best so uh this time we heated up the battery to 49° c so uh hopefully we can cool it down so we get okay speed on the next session we are getting close to brund and i have decided to skip quarter skip whatever i'm going to yolo it we're going to go to brundall uh we are now down to 7% it drops so fast now it's crazy towards the end 6.5 oh oh come on uh there's no indicated range left 6% oh okay wa i'm getting i'm getting cold feet now let's slow down a bit because now if we can just roll down the hill then we'll safely get over to uh supercharger six oh 5.5% no i hope this is not the bad idea um yeah but we just have to clear the hill now we're going to go downhill and then see there supercharger down there somewhere oh man come on come on 5% are we going to regen yeah well we have oh yeah they say we start regening okay okay we're good we're good oh yeah we have the supercharger we came here with three okay hopefully that didn't hurt us too much but yeah we are now getting 55 kw i think it's slowly ramping up yeah but i mean i'm happy with 55 kw at this point but okay the way we count now is that you look at the current time you you deduct me minus 5 minutes that is the current 1,000 km time so we are getting close to 5 and 1/2 hours we still have to charge one more time after this and you see that we are currently at 392 so we have to drive 108 more kilm o i i don't think we can beat the uh i don't think we can beat the bmv i3 but we should at least be able to beat the old record 7 hours and 10 minutes so we have to see how long does it take but okay for you guys who don't know um the adapter works now with supercharger but only the v2 supercharger v3 and v4 it doesn't work so i just know that it works here so yeah man what an intense trip but you see if i had more experience with the adapter and the car i could have maybe have gone 5 10 minutes faster i would avoided some locations and stuff but i mean then the challenge wouldn't be that exciting right we just turn around at rda and we have reached 400 km we have 100 more kilm but we are getting ready if i mean we're getting close to the 6 hour mark oh okay and also uh mysteriously now the battery inlet is 18° c with 10° outside it seems maybe it was the first theory that uh heat in the cabin i don't know from somewhere here heat leaks into the through the cardboard yeah so that means that we have to have the cabin coold oh okay let's uh get over to the next charter i think it's going to be uh tongue and uh yeah okay i don't have any map to show you guys right now oh i just realized something it's if you look at the clock now this is uh the 6 hour and 5 minute mark roughly you know and that is the time when ionic would finish the challenge and go 500 km and we are still at only 436 how the heck can the ionic be so good man uh i have no idea well i mean it's probably a combination of good efficiency but also uh b slightly better thermal management okay we are now at tongen there are plenty charg over there the c k chargers they might not work rug charge thingy i haven't tested them i'm going for camp power because i know it works with the adapter and actually i'm getting more than 125 oh sorry more than 125 so we are not yoling it we're getting 54 kilow at 48 so okay some guy in here he claims that it's pointless to use the adapter but then if i use the native chadal oh sh over there i would be getting around 45 kw yeah so this one here we're charging faster but we also overheat slightly faster we'll see how it goes but i have not covered the the the back here again you see the trunk it seems it was a bad idea so that means you don't want to mess with anything just keep it as original possible and that should give you the best result but i have to show you guys something okay so here we have so much stuff we have cop over there seen charger we have neo swap station uh this is going to be the new powerhouse for charging and other stuff but i was wait what what what what is this ion o ioni come here look at that they have ion chargers what h so oh they ninja that spot and then the supercharger is way over there supercharger got the worst spot can you see it that that's v yeah but i cannot use them v4 and v3 supercharger doesn't work with it up there yet but i can see ion there oh h i mean can someone tell me what the heck is going on over here because just a couple of years ago there was nothing here when it comes to charging and then there was some 50 kow at s k and now there's so much charging over here i think they're they're planning on getting some shopping st i don't know maybe not shopping set but some businesses over here but the charging here is just insane on this stretch this is insane but okay we're almost done i have to prepare now and get ready i don't know if this is going to be the last session or not we'll see but we have to drive only 55 more km before we are done hm h let me test something here see it's 12° outside i don't know what the inside temperature is because i don't have that value in here oh sh it started throttling we're down to 36 kw oh oh uh oh but it seems it helps h i should have thought about this before um it seems yeah it mixes so i open up all the doors and by opening up everything i mean everything okay i okay i didn't open the trunk yeah um that probably doesn't matter but by opening everything you let in more cool air in here that gets mixed in with the intake thingy and then you get better cooling it's a bit late to figure it now do we have to redo the challenge oh man suddenly the charging stopped okay the adapter is way more stable now but it seems to still bug sometimes but quite rarely during this challenge it happened that it stopped so we now resuming i need around 65% yeah but i'm going to go for go for it this is going to be the last stop before we uh finish the challenge but you see it's charting kind of slow so you are tempted to leave but the problem is that if we would hammer it um we have to stop one more time and then stopping one more time means that you have to exit the motorway and then get over to the charger and then pull out the cable i mean pull out the adapter plug it in you know authenticate wait for handshake and then after you finish you have to stop it and then so actually we can count maybe three minute of overhead and if you charge for 3 minutes that means you spend 6 minutes total right so if even if you charge at 55 kw effectively it's only half of that which is 20 7 kilow you're getting if you would charge here so now we're getting 29 kow i don't know if that makes any sense in that case it is better for to stay here and charge a little bit longer incept for that now the charging bred oh i just realize something now we are currently at 6 hours and 35 minute of the challenge time and bmv i3 finished at 6:30 we are already we have lost against the i3 huh we still have to drive another 55 9 9999 we're being you're being humiliated by the i3 how could that be possible the i3 char is slower than us well the i3 has liquid cool battery deutsche engineering yeah okay i think we have enough 68% let's stop at 69% nice round number but at this point we don't care about battery temperature anymore uh we don't care about inlet so what we can do now before we unplug is to stop this and then what is b b fan sty is going to go down to i don't know uh seven maybe eight oh still high okay and then we can just turn off hb let's go 69% oh yeah all right the final run and we have to go 50 more kilm from here and you see this time without the box active the fan is still going at8 so um yeah i want to see now how much or how hot it gets without the hack maybe it made almost no differ difference uh who knows we'll see we'll see at least oh we are almost there but we are down to 6% left i have to slow down i have to slow down we have no indicator range left oh it's l but we're going to do the countdown it's going to be somewhat slow countdown and then i have to go super slow there 99 4990 lo lo lo no no stop looking me 4992 49 and3 49 and4 495 oh over sorry 496 497 come on come on 498 499 500 time 712 which means the 7 hours and 5 minutes it was a 5 minute improvement only what the heck i'm down to 3.5% i have to go slow now l some l some there's there's turtle mode going on i don't want to run out the juice on the freaking challenge come on we have to get over to the charger now oh is it don't die don't die i have 57 kow power limit 2% left i hope it doesn't shut down on 1% or some i'm going to pull out now come on on oh what what happened to the temperat margin i thought i had huh what the heck man oh don't die now come on come on you just have to get in there get in there get in the safe zone here man that was scary 2% okay now that we have some speed we can just roll up to the camp power or something i don't know man but i don't have enough juice to even go home right now i have to juice up here oh sh this was so close okay let's um get over here interesting camp power reports as 1% i don't know why the car displayed as 2% so whatever you do with this old classic uh korean cars you don't want to go too deep otherwise you might get stranded but we are safe now and i even had 10% margin so listen dr un bej get enough margin before you you go for it so now we are safe we're going to get enough juice to just go home we are uh i don't know 8 kilm away from home and now for the donation shout out there are some people in liv stream who donated money for me to help me pay for the bills and uh that is san $5 thank you very much we have c4 tip $25 nice than and then u hner he's deuts also $25 oh thank you very much and i think that's yeah so not that many people it wasn't super active but at least it helped me pay for the bills and i will just keep hammering it this was interesting challenge it didn't go as well as i planned but i suspect that maybe the koreans they already figure out that uh you know it's it's somewhat pointless to run the fans spin at nine even seven or eight is good enough and yeah when it comes to the whole inlet why was it even designed this possibly because uh the koreans they try to save money not want to spend too much time developing the car they want to bring the soul out in the market relatively fast and also affordable and that's why they took some shortcuts some uh compromises and it was still working good enough for most people but then when we drive it we do hard and fast then we see problems but if i would go to yo then it would work just fine and we will probably not overheat so yeah and then what about all the gadgets the emergency box and what they used today how about that was it pointless i'm not sure uh but i get the impression that um uh we were already on the limit of what was possible and with those little tweaks here it seems it didn't help that much so i think it boils down to physics that air is a bad thermal conductor that's why in insulation in house have something there a material filled with air because then it insulates really well that's why glass has triple layer with air inside there's no vacuum inside or something else in there well actually maybe they could do that i'm not sure but but uh and then when you try to use air to cool down the battery it doesn't work that well i mean it works kind of but you know there's a reason why you put thermal paste between the cpu and the cooler right so you can try to f speed n but there is so much heat you can transfer out to the system right so that's why it ended up being it is so if we really want to upgrade something to make it better we need to volar needs to make this battery liquid cool which is going to be super complicated now forget about it or we could change the chemist we could change the cell to something that has lower internal resistance for example the eolf battery and the uh the e up battery they don't heat up that much when you discharge it and even when you charge it versus this battery or the leaf battery so that would help that would actually make a bigger difference but that also cost money and so on so seems the small hacks we did sorry one seems it didn't help that much but it was a fun test and it was a fun physical test to verify if it worked or not so yeah this this emergency box thing here is probably not going to sell very well on ebay when it comes to this adapter um i have to say that it is very nice that we are able to access ionity and tesla supercharger or other places uh uno x many many more and more sites nowadays they only offer ccs plugs so for the flexibility it is nice and also for the speed yes but in our case since we were hammering it it seems we then hit the the bottle neck which is thermal and it charging speed wise we probably we would probably have gotten the same end time maybe or very similar if we only used the 50 kow yeah so but if i would go to yo and i had to drive slow or if i had longer brakes in between you know a lunch break or something and allow the battery to cool down then this b this adapter would definitely help but it is expensive but it gives you the flexibility so i think if you consider buying it maybe you can buy it but then you can try to rent it out when you're not using it because keeping it all the time i mean it's going to be kind of expensive right you can't get the value of money back but it was still interesting and also this becomes more and it gets better and better support and becomes uh also more stable so compared to the first run i had it was super unstable and also didn't work on many stuff so even if we will do another re test of soul then maybe we can even get more out of this i mean more yeah uh stations and whatever so anyway uh interesting test it was still worth it and i still enjoyed every second of it because now i had to go back to the family and do some daddy stuff so that's going to be for now i hope you guys enjoy this as always thank you for watching and talk to you later",4
Bjorn Nyland,PLqKx2qnB8Xv75gTigBULlYUYT95jZXWGY,xOoGNXxhnQo,this was brought to you by stoneberg aed ro planner mr green camp power and marcus beal yo what's up welcome to baby view so in this i'm going to try to put baby stuff in this car which is tesla model s performance raven and it should have good space right it is a very popular car in norway and throughout the rest of the world it's been existing for a while so we tried earlier uh the bmv to see how similar items fit in there and now we're going to try the same with the tesla so uh maybe i should show you the front first oh yeah it's nice to come back to a car with the front uh however it's somewhat limited because we have the hepa filter up here so i'm going to show you give you idea how big the space in the trunk frun is you can almost fit uh cloud set in there well actually if i uh why would you want to do it anyway but in case you want to do it can we just uh can you kind of squeeze yeah you see you see yeah you can almost fit there but it means that uh if you need space i mean if if the trunk is taken up by uh baby stuff then you could put groceries or whatever else in the front here at least the front seat has no uh eso fix not many cars have it and uh here we don't have a button to disable uh the airbag we have to do it from the screen and you do that by clicking on the car icon down down here go to safety scroll down a little bit and you see passenger front airbag it's grayed out now we have to press the brake and then you want disable yes and now it's disabled and let's do the trunk test first so see here we have a cybx e preum i would consider it medium siiz stroller but it has the car cod which makes it kind of big so the plan now is to see can we fit it in the trunk here how do we do it and how much space do we have left may maybe i should start by taking off this one just for convenience the partial shelf a trunk in the mless is quite big given that it's a combi sedan it's not even a station wagon and also under here we have a nice deep w to put lots of luggage so you could even configure this maybe yeah you can take off this lid if you want to fit the stroller if you have problems fitting it but we're going to leave it on for now and see how it goes okay so let's try to put the carot first and then we take the eum uh frame wait huh who i just noticed something here you know in the bmv it was wider in the back so i managed to slide well actually how did i do yeah i slid it right in there in thex but now we suddenly see that um the model s has two narrow uh trunk here so we can't do that one we have to put it something else actually this would work if we just put it this something this we don't even have to take out the wheels uh oh you know what maybe i should have uh put this in this direction no actually then the wheel is okay okay let's just put it this okay we have it this right and then let's check it if the door closes or not all right the clos us so actually it seems we have more trunk space here in the model s versus the the bmb you see we have plenty of space here for luggage uh we have a little bit on the side here and also the space under there so let me just out of curiosity let me try to use the space under there see how what uh how it goes then and yeah maybe i should also show you if i want to compact some more and i take out the wheel where's the button again i'm still if you take out this wheel and the other wheel here then it becomes easier to fit and also this is what i had to do in order to fit it in the model 3 but just uh let's see now we have the wheels off just take move remove them and now let's see how much space it takes up then oh yeah oh okay i should have done that again it depends if you're just going in and out uh quickly but for a longer leg trip then this will work way better and then the wheels here you can tuck them any anyway you can even tuck them in the in the well here in the wheel well here this wow cuz i'm let's see if i just put the carot there and then i take the frame and will the frame fit oh yeah it oh it fits down here now how should i lay it down this is but then you will okay maybe i should take out the now we start assembling more and more stuff though i could take out these adapters for example so so things doesn't poke out too much um but then do i want to put too much luggage on top of the frame here uh maybe it would be better idea maybe to put sturdier luggage on the bottom and then you put this one on top but uh i guess the test here is to show you uh how much space you have and i think actually when it comes to model s it has remarkably good space for a it's just a sedon it's not even suv and you see how much space we have left here for luggage so we could easily bring this for a for a holiday and then of course uh you can also compact this one and make it uh smaller let me just do it and show you how it is okay so in its most compact form then the carut becomes this small but of course it's more cumbersome to do this uh especially if you want to go in and out but but i just wonder now if we have the carot that small will it actually fit in the space under here and can we just completely put the lid over let's let's try let's try we just try all the combinations the stuff that you guys want to know i try it so you don't have to wor wonder oh look here what you can even do it this why which side is it yeah you see you could even do it this that's that's how big the space under here is so i really love the space in the model s i've been spending so much time in the model s loading and unloading cargo in here and it's just remarkable how much space it has so you know um yes it's not a station wagon so it doesn't have the space over here a square box but uh what i thought of for the longest time is that uh it has this space under here so it's almost it is a spa station wagon because you the space here is for the space up there if you know what i mean as for the back seats holy macaroni it's supposed to have isopix but look where the heck is the hook huh it's deep down jesus i've heard stories of people trying to poke the the isopix it depends which isopix base it is but uh some people actually rip the the leather the fake leather open because of this i i i don't even know if i dare to try to poke it in there what the heck okay i think i might need some lubricant or maybe some extra tools okay let's go for the easy one first the uh cybex anor t now again i'm want to use the abc always be covering well except for that this this makes it really hard because okay well i can see the hook there but it i really have to fist it's in the hook there to okay let's try now put it this right wait why was it so much easier with okay okay maybe i need to yeah i need to also penetrate this lip yeah of course my bad i'm a noob you have to push this lip in there but this still doesn't stay up it kind of stays up okay why was it so much easier in the eye now i realize how clumsy it is in a tesla okay let me try now and then we take the isix base the hooks are retracted all right entering the hole and then we arm the hooks oh they seem sharp oh oh uh oh marus be is not going to be happy when i ruin his uh nice seats in the tesla model s performance ludicrous raven oh let me see how the heck and also realize that it's a low car so you kind of you're bending over this and this is not good for your back versus the suv where you were more i could stand up more let's see can i just holding macaroni how did how do i align this how do i know i will hit the hooks ah it's so hard okay let's just try let's try okay carefully you going to penetrate slowly i'm i'm seeing i'm ruining something here man you have to be really to do this and don't want be the i got it i got it wa it's not gre yet it's still red oh it's ver for the first time wait this quick but it's still red i'm not sure why it's still red it shouldn't be green this side this side is also red this is so strange it's red i don't know why it's red why doesn't it turn green and i kind of push it far maybe i'm doing something wrong here but it's latching onto the no it's not it's not it's not let me see because i can just pull it out that side is loose this one is about to this one is green oh okay can just try this one come help it there it's gre oh holy macaroni i hope i did didn't break anything i think it's in place now right and then we adjust the height here sorry i'm a little bit noob still and especially if i'm not familiar with this i see is there there that one is green all right oh and then let's try then put the the cloud set here and yes thank you guys for letting me know that uh when you put the cloud set in here this then the handle needs to be on top not not this well it doesn't go there anyway and by the way here you guys see that and you wondering hey you you seem to have so much space or you seem to be how how much forward was the seat in the in thex it was in my driving position same here it's pretty much in my driving in my seating position but we seem to have less space here than in thex um but okay and then i have again you can just use one side here to rotate it well or this so at least that one is good and then of course i had to try to imagine bringing a baby that that's one part i haven't shown you and then try to strap the baby in here well fortunately with the cloud set you can rotate it so at least that part seems to be okay and then let's uh imagine we come back and we want to take it out all right uh either way right so just do it this and then take out the seat and then oh you see here it's kind of it's tight it's it doesn't have the height so i have to be careful when i lift it out but it works but i realize it's it's clumsier than the thex for sure okay so this this is what it looks when it's hooked on so well at least we have some protection here and hopefully it doesn't make a permanent dent on the seats because i've heard so many people with tesla they've been getting permanent dents on the seats and then people say but you can just massage it it will buff out well will it so uh uh the problem is that you know compared to the bmv uh it was so easy to take it in and out in the bm and actually relatively easy on the model three from what i remember um but with the model s at least this generation it's almost as if i want to just put it in and then i want to leave it in and don't move it there but i want to try something then there is a tool we can use uh that power gave me you see if that helps see we have these plastic pieces that hooks onto the eso fix hook in there and the whole idea is that you create a little cave here you see so it actually becomes the the volvo and the bmv holy crap this is i'm not too impressed with the tesla right now the space was very good but uh the the the mounting points here is really really crumpy okay let me see do i just wa it should be this right yeah it's not no no no it's not okay okay it's this then how the heck do i how the heck do i fist it in how to how to v out the hole and then carefully push it in without ripping anything oh come on come on oh and then wa it's plastic but i hope i won't won't rip the the seats musku is going to be so pissed if i ruin something come on come on get in the ah man it it really requires lots of force to you have to push down the seat here and then try to squeeze it in and i just don't feel forcing it right what maybe that's what you're supposed to do just force it right in oh yeah okay okay ooh oh that is so much better but now we just create a permanent dent here and here ah sha okay let's try let's try at least this one okay okay going in with a hook oh oh sorry sorry and then how this one comes in the way wa is it supposed to work in the model s or is this for the model 3 because power gave it to me i'm not sure where he got it from there there oh oh that looks so much easier now now we can actually see yeah this is way better we just turned a tesla into a volvo and i should also mention that uh where is the safest position to put the baby so yeah i put it here in the beginning which was a mistake as but i'm learning and thank you for the tip by the way i also google about this the safest spot to put your baby seat is actually in the middle seat but the middle seat from most cars i've seen doesn't have e to fix so then the second safest spot is actually over there behind the passenger seat because uh the probability of a side crash is higher on this side versus that side so the this one that i was using was one of the worst one i guess the front could be the worst one but okay but now we're going to try so we have the the the helper here the i don't know what you call it the whole widener here and then we're going to go for the hardest one which is how oh it's so heavy oh bring out the anoris tea this one i don't have seat protection because i'm already using another oh wow okay oh i got it in the tight opening of the mod l and now we have to arm the hooks you want to do this outside the car not inside because you could uh you could ruin some some of the interior on the way in here then we arm the hooks oh come on come on okay and then i align it oh this is so much easier to align it wait it starts slipping now okay look it's red still red it turns green this one is oh this was so much easier holy macaroni let me see now okay and then this foot needs to be adjusted wait a screw just fell out from somewhere what the heck this this this is not good did the screw come from d oris uh sideb is supposed to be german quality here and where did this screw come from but okay everything is green here we're ready to go and then yeah actually in this case yeah i would actually mount the the the anor te on that side because now the belt is in a weird position this but i'm just showing you how it is and one thing that many people want to know is can you actually fit three child seats in the back well apparently you can't do it here just look how much space it takes takes up so that's the cloud set on that side but uh maybe these seats are not the smallest one you mean you can buy seats that are not so wide but just in this case here there's no way you can put yet another child seat in the middle here you have to go for a narrow ones let me show you from different angles what it looks so from here yeah this one takes space there let me go maybe in the back there now you can't see from there okay go here yeah go on this side maybe no i'm not sure if you can see it yeah but we we have only around uh uh 25 cm left here so yeah ain't going to happen and can a person sit in there oh let's try let's see can i sit here ina let's say if we get two kids and wifey and and wifey sister comes along oh this is really tight this is really tight uh i i don't have space for my hips really oh oh oh this is too tight man and i don't know if it's even legal because i'm not sure if i can buckle up so pretty much if you have two car seats this then the the middle seat here cannot be used by any adults okay maybe if you can put a a child in here yeah that could work but let me just get out let me check something here can we actually buckle yeah i think we can because we a tie can wait yeah yeah you can kind of buckle up here is right yeah yeah okay it kind of works is okay the last part of the test is to remove the anor te and the cloud set base and see what happens then can i easily take it out it this on this side okay okay it's out it's out but oh be careful so before you hey what about this foot why is it so rigid um before i move it out i want to retract the the eo fix hooks so it doesn't bump into anything on the way out how's this again i just have to feel how it is this okay okay and then carefully lift it out without bumping into the interior oh okay yeah i managed to do it oh go about that screw i looked everywhere now and it's not coming from there this one but it has this hexagon uh shape so i'm not sure maybe you guys know wait but i have not used this car seat yet so i'm not sure if is from from the car seat from the tripod from the stroller or maybe from the car okay i also need to remove this one see how it goes this one should be a lot easier since it's lighter and and smaller yeah just pull out the hooks retract them completely into the base before we move it out of the car all right let me see oh this is so much easier to handle you see here out and all that's good and i take out the cover and then we have to inspect any potential damage okay on the right side uh doesn't seem to be any damage there but you know we just had it on for very limited time but then on this side when we had the hooks or the the the the ho widener you see we already have some dents here so this could most likely be permanent dent if you have it here for several hours or several days even so uh this is n good so there you guys have it model s how did it do it um let me summarize for uh for luggage space plenty of space in the in the front very good also in the back plenty of space remarkable how much space you have for a sedon when it comes to practicality entering in and out of a low car that's kind of clumsy for me and i can imagine people who are taller than me so that's a minus anyway for cars that this this segment but the biggest minus here is the isopix entry points they are so tight here and you have to just trying to fist it in or you have to use some kind of ex addons i did but then you also create d so it seems either way now you're going to create dense somehow in the seats so you just have to accept that it will have some imperfections over time but i guess if you start putting kids in there they will kick in the back of the seat and then ruin everything anyway right so yes what do you guys think huh am i being too harsh i'm just trying to be honest about things and i think in all honesty if there's one thing tesla needs to improve it's the e ofix points they have to make it easier to enter just in the volvo and the and the bm i've shown you uh recently so anyway i think that's going to be it for now hope you guys enjoy this as always thank you for watching and talk to you later,-1
Bjorn Nyland,PLqKx2qnB8Xv75gTigBULlYUYT95jZXWGY,AWAqVN0_oc0,this was brought to you by stonebar about the replanner mr green ken power and marcus beal yo what's up you know normally you don't associate porsche with family car but this must be the exception because behind me here you see the fat thai can well the real name is actually porsche tycoon cross turismo 4 and in this we're going to put some regular baby stuff in there some cybex strollers and baby seats and then we see how well it can handle it let's check out the front first so here we actually have a fairly large front comparable with tesla so i have a type 2 cable in here if you take it out it has some side pockets whatever huh what what the heck is this thing and it's black normally i see yellow i see silver what the heck are these things is this kind of weapon put it back there so anyway the utilizable space is here in the middle and just to give you an idea how big it is i'm going to take now the cloud set uh maybe if i fold a bit we can use this as a reference let me see can we actually put the cloud set in here we can almost put it there huh are you a thai can or a thai cant okay it's a thai count so you see the tai can fat thai can has a hatch opening this time the regular thai can is just a sedan opening very limited space but uh will it fit this one which is a cybex e prime it's an electric stroller so i consider this medium size let's do this regular folding and then see if we can squeeze it in here the trunk space here is okay especially compared to the regular thai can uh but not that great compared to similar sized cars and then i can show you here that under here we also have a little lid and we have a tiny spacer this is very small you can't really utilize it for anything okay let's see first we put the capricorn in here all right and then we take the frame um wait whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa this is even tighter than the model s where there's no there's no way the frame will fit there what if i have it standing this that could work yeah yeah actually there are several roads to rome right oh wait this is not gonna close ain't gonna happen buddy okay so we can't put that one there uh well then i guess the the only solution is to take off the wheels then this okay take out one wheel take out the other yeah so you have to dig around with this in the parking lot before you put the baby in well or after you put the baby okay let me see now this should be way easier when you have a detached wheel it actually then becomes narrower so we can squeeze it can we squeeze in oh i feel i wanna don't want to scratch the the carrycot maybe i should take the frame in first this is so clumsy let me take careful out again put the frame in somehow this ish and then we try a carry cut maybe i should place it uh wow really so it kind of needs to stay this i guess and then it will close right so barely i mean it is approved but i feel the space here is worse than the model s and especially way worse than the bmv ix but why do i compare against the ix which is the suv well because those are the only two other cars i've tested with this test so far so yeah i think we are done with this one uh yeah front seats are nice looking and also feels quite sturdy but no easy fix there and also no button there for disabling that yeah i i see no button here for disabling the airbag in the back we have these bucket seats but look i this lids for uh for the easter eggs ah and they're also in the same color as the paint but then what do you do with these so that's kind of flimsy you know normally i say abc always bring protection bring cover always bring cover but i feel these uh porsche seats are so sturdy uh real leather that they don't need protection you're gonna put it in here anyway let me see i guess i'll squeeze this lip in there and just fist it in and then it becomes this kind of yeah all right and then we take them let's start with a cloud set uh base you see we just bring it in here and then i arm the hooks yeah sorry it beeps wait do you have that little space well you know this seat is actually fairly forward already if wifey would sit here she will have this further back so we have somewhat limited space this is the first car i noticed that we might have some uh less space here but okay anyway let's just arm the hoops yeah i can't even pull the hooks completely out i might wanna maybe just just for the installation push the seat here front seat slightly more forward so i have more uh room and then i can always push it back again but it becomes really tight in the front right now so this is kind of clumsy that we don't have that length because i mean the tycoon is a fairly big car external wise but internal wise maybe not that much and then but this should be easy now to align the hooks here you can see there and there okay and then just push it in and then it comes green all right okay that was pc easy pc and then we extend this one by a little bit more there now it's green okay and then here you see we have a little bit of space so uh yeah let's just put in yeah let me adjust now so if i would adjust for myself let me sit here actually let's sit here and just yeah this is this is too cramped for me i want to go at least at least this much back yeah and i'm only 173 centimeters so you can imagine someone who is taller than me they want to maybe sit this yeah okay all right now let me see i'm gonna go and check in the back what it looks whoa okay it works it works that's the most important thing right and then we take the cloud set and just rotate against me well i mean we don't have to but uh just for convenience this is usually what you would do right you take it this oh well except for when if i try to do something this then this bumps into the top here it has somewhat low uh height here so i see the struggle i mean it is a family car but wait no i'm i'm not really good at aiming there okay and then we will rotate it back in this one whoa okay um uh i kind of need to we have to sit backward just okay this is interesting that the car's external size is fairly large but the internal size is somewhat limited there yes now it's green all three of them okay so this is it um you can barely recline let me try now okay so if you have it in that position the safe position how is it in the front then oh i mean i have okay position but i probably preferably want to recline a little bit and then we are almost crashing into the babysit if i can see here oh you're better touching it okay it's time to bring out the big gun cybex honoris t world's first child seat with airbag and you can have forward facing from 15 months and this was tested by adac to be the safest child seat ever yes anyway i managed to squeeze it in now we need to load i need to arm the the hooks i already pre-opened the hooks okay that one is fully extended wow this is tight i mean if you think that model s is tight then this is really tight okay and then arm the hooks push it in okay it says green that one is green all right now we're just missing the extension here there all green all is good that was fairly smooth and can you fit a third child seat in the middle here ain't gonna happen you can't even fit a baby here without the seat or it is really tight here you see so yeah that's it uh and i'm pretty sure another person can't sit there i mean i almost managed to squeeze in between the seats in the model s but this one i don't even think i would want to try because if i try i might get stuck there and now we see if we try to take the noise t out how easy is that one okay on hook these ones are they loose yes they are loose okay you want to take retract these hooks before you do anything inside the car so you don't scratch into the interior uh let me see how this went somehow it works better with the right hand there okay hooks are retracted then you just gently lift it out oh my back okay that went fairly smooth that's good and then the cloud set you see uh yeah okay okay you got the hang of it now okay maybe it's not that bad all right right that was good and then the easy fix base this should be way easier i know this tea is always the hardest one because it's so big and chunky it always beeps at me retract this one retract this one and then take out the bit yeah you see how easy it is to take out this base because it's way smaller and you see in the porsche because this is real leather sturdy that is built to last to take pounding from heavy fat germans then there is no stain there is no dents anything so this is top notch at least this part the durability part that i really haven't tested what's that what's that scratch i think it didn't come from the anores and then okay i can show you that we just take these lids and we just pop it back in place something this yeah so there you have it the fat thai can how do i it um the space in the front is nice the back is somewhat limited uh the easter fix opening is great but the space in the back is also limited so if i would give it a total score well i actually don't but i feel a mod less would be a better car even though the model x srd model s has really clumsy easter fix opening you have to fist it and bring some lubricant but i heard that it is way better in the model x so yeah i guess that's going to be it hope you guys enjoyed this as always thank you for watching and talk to you later,-1
Bjorn Nyland,PLqKx2qnB8Xv75gTigBULlYUYT95jZXWGY,9CGqbKvfrzE,this was brought to you by stoneburg about the real planner mr green ken power and marcus bill yo what's up here we have the tesla model y performance and in this we're gonna check out how well does it handle to put in baby stuff here baby stroller or baby seats so you know it's uh well i wouldn't call it suv but at least it's a crossover but unlike the model x that has this falcon wing doors this one has the conventional doors so how well is it going to be or how how good will it be for carrying baby stuff and be a typical family car so let's start with the front shall we on the front here is relatively large so let me see oh it seems the hvac is running or the battery cooling is running or something if you take out all this stuff here just put it whoa it's kind of slippery okay there now what wait what take is this thing some kind of weapon [music] let's see now if i try to put the cloud set in here can it fit here you know oh oh wait wait oh look at this wait wait wait we have to test we have to test is this the first car where we can actually fit a cloud set well maybe it needs to be this way okay then you post too much okay this is the first car we can put the cloud set in the front and actually close it let's try oh almost almost but just to illustrate how large the front is so why do i keep testing the front in every car i try is that uh in case you have to put baby strollers and stuff in the back then you will at least have space in the front for putting your other luggage when you go on a road trip so this is nice big plus in the model y and the next thing we'll do is try to put this cybex e prime in there it's a medium-sized stroller so uh the model y does not have any kick sensor unlike many german cars nowadays so we just have to open it manually but it should be fairly large and you know the space in the model y is just incredibly good not only is it quite deep here but also fairly wide and you have this lid here space under the trunk quite deep and wide and then even more space here this is just class leading space it's just incredible how much space you have i'm going to show you how big this room is so we will take let's see let me get it ready here we're going to do something crazy now uh i will take the eprium without even folding it most people wouldn't do this but i'll just show you how big the trunk is if i just put it this oh it's kind of clumsy uh just put it this just to show you and then let me see will it close really close boom it closes do you understand what i mean do you do you know what's um what do you know what i'm saying it is just so outstanding when it comes to space but okay let's do it the regular way and dismantle and this is just easy mode so i can put the the carrycot here for example and then well this is kind of clumsy though because then the wheel the the base can go here the frame i mean frame can go for something go here something this plenty of space still a shitload i can probably put two e primes in here no problem but uh maybe for practical reasons maybe the wheels are kind of smoothish so let's try the other way around and we take the carrycot up there instead and then you put the base here for example this also works well maybe i should put it the other way yeah let's try this configuration for example this right roughly this ish i'm not sure how you want this and of course it closes easily and no problem there is of all the cars i've tested the bmw ix which is larger in in external size uh the the the meb car the id4 id5 no car can match tesla when it comes to spacer and you see we even have space in the side here to put your regular luggage here we can put your backpack yeah i don't know what to say man it's just massive how much space we have and i guess we can show you the last uh configuration in case you don't want to use the space here and let's say for more day-to-day or if you're on a road trip and you want to put some luggage under here maybe you have some food maybe you have smaller items under there and then maybe you have some backpacks and luggage and whatever you have under here let's say we have in this configuration how can we fit stuff in here let's try put the carrycot here we're going to do it the same way we did with the ix and then we take the the frame will the frame fit here though no it won't so actually the ix is wider in the back here but there are plenty of other ways to solve this we can probably just put the caracot in this direction and then the frame might be able to fit in here this oh the wheel is kind of poking out now i see the problem so in this case what you probably want to do okay i think it won't close now you can take out the wheel or oh what was that sound that was a sound i didn't crack uh oh i think it hit something over here no no way my bad i i didn't fold it properly always read manual let's try again okay take two it's always easy to overlook okay okay it bumps into the wheel so what you can do you can for example remove one wheel i'm gonna spend extra time with the model wife since so many people are interested and you know people who buy more white they buy it for a reason because they want it as a family car let's see now it should close yeah plenty so this is also possible if you want to distribute the load and then it becomes easy to take this one in and out but i just want to put on this again and try to see if we put the capricorn outside first i mean afterwards and then we put the frame in first will that be any better let's try uh how should we put the frame this direction or this i think it should go this direction right yeah something this but then you kind of you need to use your back and push it in here and then all the schmutz gets in there so that's always a problem when you live in a smooth country norway and then this one oh yeah this one should be able to close now without having to take off the wheels so it's the fact that yeah you see you can do this in day to day drive and i already experienced this firsthand when i went with wifey to the police station to get passport for our baby and when we went to the shopping mall and in that case we don't want to bring the uh we can i know the other adapters you can bring the baby stroller put right on the frame or you can use duna duna is super convenient and light but when it comes to comfort there's no doubt that if you want to spend several hours in the shopping mall then this kind of bed here is the best comfort for the baby and the baby will be happy and sleeping so that's why you want to bring the big stuff here and it actually fits everything fits here in the model y so this is just top score the front seat on the model y does not have any ease to fix mounting points and also no airbag button over here so we have to do it inside the screen the back seats looks this fairly flat which is actually an advantage and then the seat can be reclined slightly this is also useful if you need to maximize the space in the trunk so actually when i tried the trunk test the seat was in this position versus the more laid back position but it shouldn't really matter when it comes to space utilization but okay and then here we have easofix points now these ones are slightly easier to access than the model s we tried so you can actually see the hooks there and there same one over there so remember that the safest spot for the baby is well actually it's actually in the center seat here but the second safe spot is here behind the passenger so that's where we're going to mount the first one so let me use this seat protector from diono so it has a little lip here we just fist the lip into the seat yeah that goes nicely in okay and then i can kind of see the mounting points then we take the cloud set this is a typical easofix base sorry for the beeping unlike the germans they are usually quiet when it comes to cars but this german car seat here beeps a freaking korean or chinese car okay oh this is kind of clumsy because i don't see the hooks and i just need to go left and right here to try to guess where the hooks are i know i feel i'm fisting a virgin here oh it's freaking tight i'm going in wait are you in yet are you in yet i mean i mean okay okay so now we see it's green yeah it's green there it's green there that's good then we level this one it stops beeping everything is secure okay went fairly well just a little bit tight the first time whoa lots of space here you see this is also very nice some cars you kind of bump into this one but here we have plenty of height to even put it in this or in cars where you have limited height what you can do is that when you rotate the cloud set then you need slightly less height to enter it you see here versus here but this is really good seems at least when it comes to space the model y wins big time so this is what i mean with the side bolsters because some cars for example the porsche thai can has thick side voices which is nice for comfort when you're sitting here as an adult but for a child seat if you have two high side bolts i experienced this in the front seat of the id5 gtx is that the sidewalls it was so high that i had trouble seeing this one you know but here you can see it and it's also easy to take it out and then let's try the anores t it is so big because it's forward-facing only seat but you can use it from 15 months most places if it wasn't for the airbag technology you have to wait until at least four years before you turn forward but not with this one but it becomes then chunky this so i have to take it in first it was actually relatively easy to take it in and out because the opening in the model y is large and then we arm the hooks we want to do this inside the car so we don't damage the interior on the way in or out on the other hook here and now we just have to oh this is always tricky come on a virgin touch for the very first time ah wait okay this one is green but this one is still red wait did i okay it's green it's green and it's green there all right wait why do you feel it's not mounted properly no it is mounted properly we just have to level it up there all is good oh when it comes to space look here we have plenty of space i don't remember what i did in the front so let's try to sit in the front wow well you see we still don't have toyota position here uh can i sit here comfortably yes i can even stretch my legs i'm 173 centimeters still but let's see now if i want to sit more laid back for example okay let's go a little bit backwards until i almost hit the seat yeah now i have plenty of space here see plenty of space now let's check out the back so this is also somewhat important because if you have a child seat yeah yeah this is efficient this is uh highly approved it means that you can have a child seat there and you can have a fairly large adult in the front without compromising the comfort as for space between the seats uh again not much space left over so yeah you have to go for slim uh child seats if you want to fit three in the back here nice bonus for the children is that we have full glass roof here so if your child gets carsick easily at least they have a nice view here and it seems as for the model y and i superb suppose also with the model 3 is that after you have some child seats here it doesn't seem to leave that many dents unlike the model s so it seems tesla has redesigned it so that at least you know the seat doesn't get dented it's just slightly harder to mount it in but i guess no big deal right there you guys have it the tesla model why what just happened to be the performers it could just be the regular one long range but yes how did it do it the space was outstanding we have plenty of space in the front we also have outstanding place in the back it was just unmuch space in the back really good okay small miners that you can't put a child seat in the front with the isofix but that's really no big deal because not many cars have it when it comes to the back here again very good score large opening relatively easy to put it in but okay uh still i would prefer those lids the german and swedish cars have but it was still not that big of a deal once you know how to put it in and take it out then so uh yes i think that's it really the model y is really really impressive one of the best cars i tried when it comes to child seats so that's going to be it for now hope you guys enjoyed this as always thank you for watching and talk to you later,-1
Bjorn Nyland,PLqKx2qnB8Xv75gTigBULlYUYT95jZXWGY,stqbczFH3Ho,this was brought to you by stonebag about the rear planner mr green ken power and marcus bill yo what's up finally we might have a relevant in this series today we're going to check volkswagen id5 gtx and see how well it fits baby stuff we now have here the cybex e prime stroller with a claricot fairly large is medium size we have some baby seats here we have the honors tea and the cloud set and yes so now let's try to check out the front as always so the meb platform that this car is a part of has been designed to not have a front but have a relatively short nose so we have more utilizable space in the back so the banana box test shows it oh one thing i don't is that this this hood is so heavy okay so you have to put this hook there if you want to see here but nothing to see and then i think you're supposed to just slam it down here so let's try to put the the cybex e prime in the trunk so let's see there's supposed to be a kick sensor here but it's not always working so let's just do it the manual way so trunk of the id5 is not that deep but it's fairly spacious in the height and you see here we can take out this lid and it becomes low or you can just if you want you can even store it here this but we're just going to take it out to maximize the space but however i will not take this bottom part out i tend to do in the banana box test because then it looks kind of weird so maybe i shouldn't be maybe i should be consistent but i think i will configure it the way most people will have it which is this so now we're going to try to put the carrycot in here this okay this is what i mean it's kind of shallow it's not so deep so uh i guess we can try this configuration first and then we take the uh the frame wow you know what the car is so uh i see i see now i see what i have to do so we just take this and now you see um what you could probably do is that you take the frame in first but how to try to put it away where you can just stand upright oh okay and then it runs into here and then it is dirty and then it gets dirty so schmutz is always a problem with german electro outus but look at this plenty of space wow it wasn't even harder i wonder if i could even put in the the stroller on on wrapped i mean on now we probably have to to kind of fold it unfolded i was about to say uh just show you maybe other possibilities oh you see this one it doesn't have the length to fit in there so it kind of you kind of need to lay it down this but if you do it this then the the capricorn won't fit the but at least i'll show you now how you can fit it in the trunk so that one is passed and this is the first car review that has easter fix in the front and we have switch here for passenger airbag okay as always i will use the diono seat cover it has a lip here so just squeezing the lip well except for that it's kind of tight here wait i can't fist in the lip um okay i'm not sure what them okay we just have to lay it down this i guess because you want to all this abc always bring protection always bring cover i mean oh okay kind of that and then i guess we'll take a regular easter fix base this is one for cloud set oh this one i know triggers your ocd i just put it in there okay and then how to arm the hooks whoa maybe i should move a little bit backward with it yeah see it's kind of tight here so maybe i want to move move backwards i have a little bit more space when i do this yeah it's just the cybex it likes to beep at me i guess it's a sense of safety all right and then we try to push it in it's fairly easy to see the hooks just to check that i'm aligned on both sides all right then we push it in not that beeping though okay that one seems to be armed this one i guess i just have to help push it into there okay all right it's green on both of them now so this one is well fit in there only thing you have to remember is not to adjust the seat maybe if you do it this oh okay you don't want to mess with it too much then we have to stop the beeping a little bit more there okay uh that way let's try that put the cloud set in here okay that fits nicely and then what about rotating okay but you see now i have the seat relatively forward so what if i want to adjust it what's going to happen then oh okay the leg just moves okay so we can probably move a little bit forward now that now that will fit it in this well i forgot that we have to bring the protection again yeah for the honor still just try to align it up there okay well actually when i said that it gets tight maybe if you don't have the protection then it doesn't get that tight but still the side bolster is kind of in the way anyway and actually by putting in this one you kind of elevate everything slightly higher so it might not be that bad or it might not be that disadvantage after all and now i'm going to go for the big gun before i do that let's put this push the seat a little bit backwards so we have more space to work with here and then we take the honoris tea which is the safest child seat ever tested by adac it has um we call it a airbag and it's a forward-facing seat and it doesn't have a e-suffix base that's why it gets kind of big and chunky this okay let me see oh you see how clumsy it is now trying to arm this and do you want to arm the the isofix hooks inside the car not outside because then you might bump into something something on the way in whoa okay and then you try to align the hooks again oh this is a lot harder than the the cloud set base this is why we need to test everything okay let's just start pushing it there okay it turns green here it turns green there we're good we're good there we are set and then in this case it's easy to just open up this one for the baby put the baby in from 15 months we can put isabelle here yeah she will get the best protection ever and in the back seat we have lower side bolsters which will actually be better for mounting child seat and here we have lid oh i this oh and it's in the same color as the paint color you know if this was tesla it would just be base based color here but i the lids and i that they stay there that some cars you take up the lid and then you have to just tuck it somewhere and they get lost but not this one oh i can't even see some of the sound proofing in there let's see now what can we squeeze in the lip here no huh for some reason we have more space in the back to squeeze in the lip okay that's good so it seems the back seat is better fit for uh mounting child seat even though you can also go for the front it's not uh that bad let me see maybe you can use you can use the seatbelt to chuck it behind it maybe it's a bad idea let's not do that i was gonna get yelled at i think beyond you shouldn't do that you're a bad father yeah okay all right and then we try the cloud set issue fixed base again arm the hooks well oh i didn't i made a small mistake i actually didn't un i didn't retract the hooks before i went in here okay and all this is so easy to line up when we have the the opening i can do that with one hand blindfolded that's how easy it was okay and then put it here i put the seat slightly forward it's not that much actually it's almost in the position where i can sit in the front well okay i should try to get a little bit slightly forward just to show you guys this and then we take the cybex cloud set and we can just put it in well okay in case you just want to squeeze it right in here uh it's kind of tight there so but you can always just rotate it you probably want to rotate it anyway right this wait why can't i do it with one hand now certainly there there okay because if you rotate it this then it's easier then you go from this angle roughly and then you just plug it in and that's it and then you rotate it this great this was such a pleasure and then let's try on this side to put the honors tee in here at the same time as we have the cloud set so again this is fairly big and bulky just wanna take it in this way relatively big opening for the door that's good and also i don't know if you notice but the door open as a at a fairly wide angle which is better if yeah all right anyway in here with this one and then arm the hooks and here also i'm kind of sitting behind myself right now so i haven't even adjusted the seat forward so i that we have enough space here to work with without having to adjust everything back and forth and this is also again super easy to line up look at that that is piece of cake it's stealing candy from a baby well that came out wrong and i guess a nice bonus is that we have panorama roof so the kids they can enjoy the nice view so they don't get carsick and i don't know how relevant this one is but yes i will show you that when we have the two cybex installed here and then there is simply not much space left in the middle so it seems to be the same story for every car i test so there you guys have it german car for german stroller and german car seat so what they think about the gtx it's brilliant you guys seen all the solutions have been tailored for having a baby in here well maybe except for the front seat but at least the back of the lid everything is super smooth super easy to use it would be so pleasant to take a trip with my baby and my family in this car so i can highly recommend it that's gonna be it for now i hope you guys enjoyed this as always thank you for watching and talk to you later,-1
Bjorn Nyland,PLqKx2qnB8Xv75gTigBULlYUYT95jZXWGY,u0dVduz_DFA,this was brought to you by stoneberg aed ro planner mr green camp power and marcus beal yo what's up this is the first in this series i'm not sure how i'm going to do it but we'll see as we go so in this i'm going to try to fit the baby stuff in the first cars i've been testing for this series which is a bmv iix so how easy it is a fit baby stroller in the trunk how is it to fit eix in the back what about in the front and then how is it well let's start with the front seat and the front seat doesn't have eso fix not many cars have eso fix in the front uh but if you want to put the baby seat here uh with the belt here's the button for disabling um passenger airbag i think this is a common spot to have it and back door can open at a fairly wide angle that's good and the back seat to have lead for eo fix i this so it's hidden behind the cover and also this one oh is it even springload no no it's okay but uh this le stay there unlike in the mercedes i saw recently then the leads leads detou and remember the a bc always be covering so here we have a seat cover protector thing uh it's from diono so on top here we have some rubberized stuff well actually rubber is higher also so that's good i'm i'm not sure it's is probably a fake leather and then i have to align it and we can see here we open up the lids so it's easy to see the hooks actually the hooks are in the same paint color as the car h i wonder if you have red car if you have red hooks in there but okay line up here so we can see the the hooks of this okay maybe tuck that way in so it looks nice and then we bring out the isofix base then i have to extend the the eso fix hooks here right here and here and then we just line up and you see you notice that we have fairly nice opening here this is good because it's a suv so i can just get in here and i'm not that big of a guy even and i can kind of easily do this you see that one have to uh align up okay okay good see there there let me say double check that one is green that one is green all right all that's good let me extend the leg a little bit more there this one is also green all right and this is the base for um cloud set and all this is sidebags by the way uh so what i is that you can just rotate it up on there this towards myself i'm going to take the child seat this is cloud set i love it i'm going just put it in here there okay maybe fall on this one just imagine that there's a baby in here it back there everything is green and we are good and then let me try the scenario yeah one thing i about this cloud set is that the the sun wiser here doesn't only go here but it actually extends all the way here very convenient when it's sunny outside um so then that's the the l oh of course ideally what i should do is is uh actually bring an actual baby here but i'll probably not do that but i would do something this i would put the baby here i will strap it in blah blah blah but you see that i'm 173 cm and at least for me i can stand upright and i don't have to bend over that much so that that's actually an with suv uh we can see how it goes with a model 3 then eventually but um in the other case then is that the after we are done driving we want to take the baby seat out uh i can just do it this there's several ways to do it uh you don't always have to rotate but if i just have it in this position uh then i just press here release it and take it out and again it's it's nice that we have the height here see because i'll be lifting it up and then i tend to bump into this one and it goes fairly easy in and out so really since this is the first car that i don't know what not much to say but it's just check checks all the boxes and you saw how smooth it is and here we have cybex e prum is basically the same as the regular prum it has a motor so the size is the same uh and we have also the carot which takes up some space this is the one for uh newborn up to 6 months very comfortable and then you see that i would say this is um a medium siiz uh stroller is not that big compared to the double one or whatever and then compare that one to duna which is ultra portable but this is something completely different just to show you how big but uh we don't care too much about the duna right now because uh we're going to test now how is it to place this one because when you bring the dona i should also mention by the way when we bring this one that i'm show that it's uh it becomes a car seat just this you put it right in the car and then for the cases when we use this one for example going to the grocery store then you just trick out with a baby and then instantly it becomes a very nice and portable stroller but the comfort here of course is not that great compared to the carot uh that's why yeah but so in this case we uh i can't think of any situation where i need to to put this one in the trunk it just stays in the car or outside but this one will need to be put in the trunk since we have um we use the the eum in combination with the cloud set so let's see now first okay let me try to take out this one take out the top i need to fold this down and the top usually fits nicely uh here see this and then we follow the rest see there and this eum can take out the front wheels um a little spoil alert already i had to take out the front whe actually it's not the front it's actually the back wheels yeah i forgot it's the back wheels the big wheels i can show that how you do it just um there's a button here and then you take out the wheels but in this case with the bx me see how did they do this again i cheated beforeand yeah so with thex you can take this one and slide it right in and it will actually close the slow clap for thex which is almost as big as m x and you can fit everything in there um um what about the space for other luggage well um i can show you that you still have a little bit of space here i could probably optimize this if you're going on a road trip maybe maybe there's other ways to to make it more optimiz but um i should also show you that u yes um take this one out first okay let me just there um in thex you also have okay wait i have to i don't want to put it on the ground so i want to just hook it back in here okay there was almost no cr luggage space here but under here fortunately you have a little bit of storage for at least cables and maybe a little bit of stuff but yeah i guess if you're going on a road trip across europe you probably don't want to bring the eum you probably want to bring something smaller anyway or i don't know maybe you need an es8 but yes i think this completes the test now you guys have seen it of course i didn't try to take out this part and then you could fit it for taller up maybe you should do that how did i do this again yeah i'm not sure if people will do it this um because you know when i do when i when i tried the banana box test i actually fill up all the way here and you can put the yeah yeah it has this one it has the there we have the the securing net we can hook up here and then you can uh you can fill it up to the top let me just try now yeah i'm not convinced that i want to stack stuff on top of each other so yeah i i tried at least maybe you guys have a better idea but um this is the way it is so yes uh i think that's complet the test was it something i was missing in the test i'm not sure this is the first time i do it so um let let me know in the comments and i will try to uh improve so do you guys it is it useful for you because eventually i'm going to test for example model 3 and you will see that the model 3 you cannot fit these two items straight in there uh well actually this one i forgot to mention this one you can compact it but you have to take out the pillow and then in here you can you can make it thinner so that will i guess work if you don't take it in and out too much but i already took it on a on a uh uh trip with wifey just in and out of grocery stores and um yeah some some stuff we had to do and some errands and then it was this park and then take the baby out of the cloud set and no no actually park and then i have to take out everything and then assemble the stroller and then get over there and then take the baby out and put it in there and then the same thing when we park uh when we come back i mean come back to the car then put the baby in the in the baby seat and then i have to disassemble everything so of course this is kind of cumbersome versus this one where you just z in and out but it depends because if you go to u to uh a shopping mall and we stay there extended time then uh i guess it's not that that comfortable to have the baby in here versus having the baby baby in the in the car cot so that's why we have to figure out uh where are we going are we just going to r and tuon then we use this one are we going on a shopping mall and spend several hours there then we bring the the e pr so yes um i think that's going to be it hope you guys enjoyed this as always thank you for watching and talk to you later,-1
Bjorn Nyland,PLqKx2qnB8Xv75gTigBULlYUYT95jZXWGY,8F6M7ZcVVOQ,this was brought to you by steinberg a better world planner mr green camp power and marcus beale yo what's up this is the tesla model 3. it's all over the place all over the world pretty much even in thailand and in this i'm gonna show you guys how good of a family card is because you know many people they keep saying they keep telling me hey bjorn once you get a baby you have to get an suv well do we have to get an suv because actually we've been using the tesla model 3 many many times when i had a baby in there and we also brought a baby seat we brought some uh this is uh cybex stroller medium size and it works just fine i don't even have to take off the wheels i'm going to show you how to do it so i guess as usual we will start with frank okay let me see it's relatively large tesla's still known to having large fronts compared to some legacy autumn huh what what the heck is this thing some kind of weapon okay i guess i'll just put it there in case i need the weapon but here again we'll try the honoris cloud set and we just use this a a measuring device i guess to see how it came in could not be found right we can't just put in the cloud set here and close the front can we we can we can almost do it you see so it's um it's a big front and normally you wouldn't put baby stuff here anyway but the point is that wait how do i flip it back now the point is that in case you need to put stuff all all the stuff in the back then you have plenty of space here in the front for your other luggage the the adult luggage this is a cybex e priam as a medium-sized stroller with only one baby and it has the carry code which is relatively large and we this one because of the comfort and we're going to try to put it in the trunk now you see the model 3 is not that big external size but the trunk is in true tesla style quite large fairly wide not maybe not the widest but at least it's quite deep and also we have stuff space here you can put the stuff cable so additional luggage but here is where the magic happens we have a lid under here and it's so big that's what she said many other cars they normally don't have this kind of deep well under here so they more have more shallow well but this one will actually be very important but just showing you guys what it looks here so one downside with the model 3 is that you have this small opening you don't have that big hatch opening so i don't know what this thing is called sedan lid or something so initially what i did was that i put the the carry coat in here and then i took the eprium frame and i would uh do it this kind of this but then it wouldn't fit here without taking off the wheel i'm gonna show you what does it close i think it's not supposed to close it just pokes up a little bit yeah you see it boom yeah wait doesn't it go out for me all right so what you did was to take off these wheels the rear wheels i'm going to show you you can take them off this is quite standard but i found out i found i cracked the code so what you have to do is you take off this lid you can leave it at home or you can just slide it rather use you slide it there i'll show you this it was almost as if it was made for it right and then you put the camera cut on top there and this time when you take the epm frame wait how is this again i think you poke it in why doesn't it fit now it's a demo effect every time i want to show something it doesn't work now it kind of sucks a little bit in there so it will close and see i'm using only a little bit yes thank you thank you elon musk yes the man the myth yeah lord the lord himself yes the almighty so you see now in this position you even have space under here you can you can put some luggage here and then you just squeeze this in and you can put luggage on the side but if you go on long trips what you can also do is take off the wheels but this is just for when you go in and out we would tend to do we go to the city or shopping mall and then we don't want to take the wheels on and off all the time so this is really brilliant because even the eqe i tried recently which is a larger car couldn't fit this one without taking the wheel so model 3 does not have easy fix in the front you see and also no button here to disable airbag you have to go inside the screen to do it and here uh that it's kind of clumsy you see we have isofix points here indications but there is no lid or anything that unlike most cars out there so usually i'm gonna finger it to fist it in there but at least it's not as bad as the model s and also the seats are fairly flat so let's start with the dot side then which is considered the safest place to put the child seat so remember to always use protection if you actually use protection that you wouldn't have to have that baby right i'm just kidding but okay especially in the tesla which i feel doesn't have that sturdy leather then you really want to use protection so we have this one from diono and there's a lip so you just want to hold the lip just stick it in there this it doesn't go all the way but that's good enough roughly this and then you kind of need to remember where the the easy fix points are and then you bring out the easy fix base um over here you bring it inside and then you um mount i mean you arm the hooks this and then you find out where there is just look at the oh yeah this is the tricky part because you don't want to poke any holes in the leather i heard some people managed to do that so you kind of just have to stick it in there and then observe on this side carefully penetrate the leather there okay this one is green this one is still red there is green okay both of them are green now and then this one is beeping of course it's kind of annoying but you can imagine if the car seat goes out of position while you're driving then you want to have that beep now it's green okay and then we bring on the car seat so one thing i want to check is how large is this well it's relatively tall enough okay so i can just do it well okay i have it in the weird position now so that's kind of normally you wouldn't have it forward facing but it can actually rotate also this this week's base actually let me just redo this i'm gonna do it this okay this is more natural this is more the way you want to do it okay just slice into place then we rotate and you can see that we actually have relatively large space here and i'm yeah this is the position i would be sitting anyway so that's good and this is more of a challenge because this is the honoris tea it's a forward-facing seat only a forward only i mean with airbag and you see how bulk it is because it doesn't have an easy to fix base so i managed to get it in that's fine we arm the hooks let's hope i don't rip any a leather here on fake leather because then much goose might be a sand panda when telling that well you just have to write this as expenses for your business you wanna wait i think the trick was you you align in this one first cut this and then you look here and you're on the line in this one you see the hooks they are kind of hidden-ish in the leather but they are not you don't have to go that deep yeah i think this one is good okay now it beeps also different beep what about this red oh you see it's kinda tricky that one is green that looks good this one is green okay there now it's properly mounted then we just adjust this one now it's all green here so that was uh fairly straightforward you see way better than model s would you see because the seats are relatively flat i don't have any massive side bols then it's easy to see the the indicator here also easy to take it in and out so i have to say this car is pretty uh child friendly yeah i have a good space here i'm still 173 centimeters and we even have a little bit of space behind so i could even recline or go slightly more backwards if you want to but when it comes to the space between here just all the other cars we tested you simply can't have anyone in the middle there these seats are kind of big and bulky but they are the best when it comes to safety so uh yeah so there you guys have it tesla model 3. this one is even a performance version works as a family car just fine no problemo so people claim that you need to have an fcb well maybe that's the case for other cars but teslas are in general very spacious and you can fit so much luggage in there so no problem so now we're going to ask you guys do we have anyone in here who owns a model 3 and also has kids just comment i just want to see and i want also to show people out there that you can actually use a model 3 as a family car with babies so yes i think that's gonna be it for now hope you guys enjoyed this as always thank you for watching and talk to you later,-1
Bjorn Nyland,PLqKx2qnB8Xv75gTigBULlYUYT95jZXWGY,W1v7J88-gpA,this was brought to you by stoneburg about the replanner mr green ken power and marcus bill yo what's up this is the byd tank and in this i'm gonna check out how good it is as a family car so i have cybex e3 and baby stroller here i have cybex another t and cloud set over here we will check out how practical it is to mount the equipment here and also how much space we have in the trunk so because this tank is based on the fossil car also then we don't have to look in the front there nothing to see in nothing see it's just void the void so let's see now how this one fits in the back so the cybex apron we've been using now with our baby works great it has the carrycot which is fairly large and this is i can see they're just a medium sized stroller they are biggest rollers out there the one with the double for the twins and stuff or emma younger they tend to be bigger but this one it's medium size but some cars struggle to get it in but this one is big it has more space than e-tron fat eatron more space than the mmv cars id4 go home this one is quite spacious so i can't wait to load this in the trunk and see how it fits the tang has kick sensor actually i consider that an advantage well it's supposed to be around the norway flying here i think that's an advantage for uh family stuff because you might have your hands full and then all right so let me show you here if i take the base and oh it's relatively wide wow this is so spacious if i put it there and then we take the carrycot i could probably put two of these let's see if it closes here this is easy mode it's so spacious well okay i forgot to mention that we have third row folded down but yeah this is this is so easy man i don't know if i should show you guys more but we didn't have to take out the wheel anything it was just so easy so spacious here and in the front end we don't have any isofix here and also hey no switch for turning off the airbag do you have to do it inside the screen near the back not the most child-friendly solution so we can see the easter fix points here and oh okay uh wait where's this okay whoa so i just have to finger it in there same on that side okay as usual i will also use the protection it's kind of interesting to see okay yes we can poke it in there this makes it maybe slightly harder to hit the target we'll just try so we take now the easter fix base it beeps over that maybe i should just unbeep it this but now we arm the hooks can i hit it though well one thing i notice is that we have fairly good working height here since this is a i i think we should call it an suv right this is a relatively large car so at least good entrance here let's see if i can hit the hooks though how the heck uh do i just try to aim for it and hope that i'm gonna rip open the seat what about this side wow this is kind of clumsy i had to fist in the hole and see if we can hit the hooks is that it says does it say it's green here it's green there well okay it works all right yeah right missy this one though should i lower it a little bit there now it's too low now it stops beeping that's it and then we can rotate this one then bring the cloud set and here this is also something i checked yes see i can hold it here and it's really easy to enter it because we have a large opening and then rotate it there voila our next challenge is another tea it's a lot bigger this is forward facing only but entering here is super easy because it's so big entrance okay we'll arm the hooks these better not be sharp oh okay this one is always tricky just wanna always arm the hook inside the car and then i have to try to find the hooks again here so i guess if i just locate it and then just fist it there wait what about this time okay so i have to go enter here to see that side whoa feel i'm going to ruin some nice leather here there there okay this one is green this one is green and now we just have to extend the length that went relatively well again because we have so much space here and here i can show you how much space we have because i've adjusted the seat here to be roughly my position i have on the driver's side and you have so much leg room here left over some cars they tend to be a bit tight here okay now i adjust the seat back until i roughly hit the seat and let me show you how much space i have here plenty well this car seems really spacious compared to the other ones many cars are tested they are in the middle here the rear seat here it seems to be quite cramped and then the middle here is really tight but here i could almost sit there okay i just have to try i have to try this is this is build your dreams i can i can climb in look at this look at this i could sit here and then be hey how is this baby oh how is that baby okay just to show you that my fat hips can actually fit here kind of so this is just a showcase of how good the width of the seat here is and i think this is important for you guys to consider having three child seats in here of course you won't don't want to use these fat seats but maybe slimmer ones but it should fit just fine in the byd tang all right that's it this is the build your dreams tank you can build your family with this car no problem it has so much space in the trunk so much space in the back it's super comfortable when it comes to space so that is no problem get a little bit minus for the practicalities for the mounting points but also the entrance here is also really easy big spacious ice i mentioned spacious a couple of times in this i think and that's pretty much what this car is all about it has more space than all the other cars i've tested so far but of course i haven't tested neo es8 but yes i even claim that this one has more space than model y yet should have it so i think that's going to be it for now i hope you guys enjoyed this as always thank you for watching and talk to you later,-1
Bjorn Nyland,PLqKx2qnB8Xv4UQsSC5Is-1xLNApnV0_cm,KoW6DnSOGT0,"this is a... what do you call it... charging station? for ev and tuk tuk. evs also? yes. they can charge here too? yes. and if they want to charge here, do they need any cards? they have a smart card. one for each person. each owner will have a name and a code. and they are able to charge here. will they get billed? we contact the bank. krungthai bank we have to add money to the card. and when we charge, they will subtract money from the card. how much does it cost to charge here? for one kwh. what is the thai name of that unit? about 7 baht (€0.21) per unit (kwh). a bit more expensive than home. how much does it cost at home? about... 4-5 baht (€0.12-0.15) per kwh at home. so it's a bit more expensive. but it has to be that. just in other countries. ok, then let's go over there. in thailand they use these. wow, take a closer look here. this is starting to be troublesome. i don't recommend using these. it will cause problems. they call these ""schuko"". they are not made for continous high loads. there are two over here. and two more over here. and over there... this is a charging station. can i press here? one year ago it didn't use this connector? in the beginning it didn't use it. but now we use the standard. safer back then it was more a prototype. testing about charging and so on. now it has developed to type 2. this is safer and more standard. in europe they also use type 2. the tuk tuks who are waiting here... are they waiting for customers or are the drivers having a break? they are having a break. they are alternating between the breaks. there's a line group. when they finish charging, they will tell on line that they are done. then others will come here by the queue. and in general, these electric tuk tuks... how many hours do they need to charge per day? this needs to be divided. it depends on each driver's habits. if we charge after one day of driving, then the battery will be low (by the end of the day). then it needs about 3 hours of charging. but if it's a case my colleagues who charges here. they might drive in the morning. and in the afternoon they might have more work. during the breaks they will charge. then it might be half an hour or one hour depending on the driver.",1
Bjorn Nyland,PLqKx2qnB8Xv4UQsSC5Is-1xLNApnV0_cm,UetQ86-BIzM,"a, can you help me translate? it runs on gas, right? here is a map. how long did he run it? about the gas. ten years. do you work here? chiang mai university are you a scientist? yes this battery, how much... can you be in the video? how many kwh is the battery? about 70 kwh. and how many km can it drive? and it works a regular car?",4
Bjorn Nyland,PLqKx2qnB8Xv4UQsSC5Is-1xLNApnV0_cm,OmJXKzWpMQc,"mr. don when did you buy this mg zs ev? around october. you have used it for a month. actually, not october. it was in the beginning of september. two months already. and where do you live? i live in bangkok. near suvarnabhumi airport. i drive it to work. if i only use it for commuting, it's about 20-30 km total. but sometimes, i travel from home to the city the round trip then is about 70-80 km. so in one day you don't drive more than 100 km? yes, less than 100 km. have you ever tried to test the range of it? i tried driving from bangkok to pattaya. the car was fully charged to 100 % from home. i drove to pattaya and stopped at a hotel. the car had 50 % left. what's the distance from here to pattaya? about 160 km. and when you drove there, did you drive on the super highway? yes, the regular route that people take. how fast did you drive? the speed? it was around 100-120 km/h. wow, really? and you achieved almost 300 km range. if it was a round trip? it also depends on the traffic. the day i went, it was on a weekday, not on a weekend there was less traffic and no traffic jams. very good! 300 km. it depends on the traffic situation also. are there many charging stations in bangkok? in bangkok there are many. very convenient. in this shopping mall, cdc there are several stations. just here. in other malls where many people go to, almost all of them has charging stations. do you charge outside your home? i usually charge at shopping malls, when i go shopping or dining. when i come back, the car is almost full. how much do you have to pay for it? right now, it's free at the shopping malls. some malls require payment. and what about fast chargers? i charged at pattaya that day. the fast chargers are free for now. very good! when i arrived at pattaya, i had 50 %. then i plugged in, it took 40 minutes and meanwhile i chiled and had a coffee. when i came back, the car was almost full. i didn't charge anywhere else and went straight back to bangkok the same day. so after two months with this car, did you have any issues yet? the problem that i had lately, was the 12 v battery. other people in chiang mai also had it. it was really bad one day, i went to work and had to park the car at home for five days. when i got home and started the car, there was a message 12 v battery low. start now. that was after five days. i tried to start but it wouldn't start. the screen and everything flickered. and then turned off. so i called the mg call center. they sent someone to jump start the battery. after that one, it happened again. about 3-4 days after. but that time it did start. i went to the dealership i bought the car from. they checked everything. they said normally there's no problem. they took out the 12 v battery and charged it. nothing was replaced. but it happened again several times. so i took the car to the main dealership in on nut. they checked again and found out that the problem with low 12 v battery was caused by tbox module. there was an issue. something abnormal which caused it to self-check all the time without me interacting with the car. will they fix it? it's done already. i just picked up the car today. ah, they did replace some parts? yes, they replaced tbox module. does bangkok have many repair shops for mg? yes, many. in almost every, every area, or lots of them. many people in thailand use mg. so if you have any issues, do you have to wait long before getting a repair? not long, if you call them. if it's not mg on nut, which is the main office. lots of customers go there. if you call other showrooms, you will get an appointment right away. so if you have an issue today, you can go there right away? yes, right away. the day when i couldn't start the car. i called the call center. and after about 20 minutes, a mechanic arrived in a bike with 12 v battery to jump it. fixed right away. that's very good. so overall, are you happy? yes, i the car. i the car. i the instant acceleration. i have never used an ev before. and i'm quite impressed. and about pollution it's better. i love the planet. what car did you own before? i own another car which is a bmw 3-series. it's a diesel. which car accelerates the fastest? if we talk about acceleration from standstill, with the mg, once you press the pedal, it goes. faster than the bmw. even if it's a diesel it is fast. if compared, once we push the pedal, this car instantly moves. but that car still needs some time. once we reach some speed though, the bmw will be faster. in the city, the ev is way more comfortable. ok, very good. thank you so much.",4
Bjorn Nyland,PLqKx2qnB8Xv4UQsSC5Is-1xLNApnV0_cm,s9wIYbTx-xY,right and the next owner here is leaf owner yes you you're comfortable speaking a little bit in seconds okay so you this is a japanese this is imported from japan mm well i i got information from the gray market reporter the important since 2012 but this one produced since 2011 so my god this one december 2016 okay four or five year after its produce so so it it's pretty old and yes yes this and what's color well it has only three bars left oh you mean the batteries yes yeah it's check status well the first day that i brought this car i found all ten box on this it's been 100 percent of battery is working but after several months several kilometers after using is keeping drop down down down and until now is only 30 percent booster it was a full when you bought it yes when was that december 2016 in three years yes what and how many kilometers did you drive sixteen thousand ten meters dad is sick yeah that is massive liquidation but i hey i don't want to blame to the nissan but because it's it's look a is park in the showroom for four or five years okay without charging with our using of the this car so i think it might be creating from that what there could be if it was standing there with 100% but how did you how were your charting habits boom yeah of course we that time we don't have a public chatting i bought one is each chapter and installed my home and every day i chatted and maybe overnight i don't care i just let it happen when it's rule is disconnect is stop chatting ought to be calling okay so you charge it a hundred percent every day yes and it was it was finished during the night yeah he's finished doing the night but i let it continue just watch me plugin yes yeah i i don't want to wake up at midnight rocket but how how hot is it here oh during daytime over 34 35 but the night time maybe yeah 30 30 o 28 26 that's it okay every day so means that the batteries constantly haughton yes i think yes while attaching i i heard that the fan noise okay yeah so it's a is hitting and it is start ventilating fans so right now you have almost full battery but are you fully now charging is to come wake up maybe oh i found this one o case mean between 60 to 100 percent check a so you have okay so about 60 to 100 percent but give it full hand represent but i my car can raise 40 45 kilometres 45 kilometers yes oh i see now the gum is gum estimates 33 kilometers yeah at 60-ish percent wow this is worst case of course but interesting so this is an important you mentioned yes how is it did you have any problems with the car no from beginning i just change the wiper of course it's still be at all and the view that's it that's it there's no no issues no issue that's a good thing that's at least with leaf the blue just came it was a little bit it was actually a very important person about the president of the dat evy association yes cool this organization they they got funding from the government and to subsidize the charging station so-called the country maybe last two year they spend around 200 or 300 million but oh really to installing the charging station that's good good but okay back to the car so i want to know you know back in 2016 when you bought it what other options did you have that was mg was no no don't we that time we have a three bmw i3 is caught about 4.5 million but that's more than a house yes because important yeah and battery i think is just 24 or the 22 yeah 22 or 24 the size at the 60 amp hour that's 22 oh okay yeah so that cost a lot and how much was this 2.2 million but okay same play at the c class c v 3 yeah but just sized compact car smoker so you just well you could about a better faucet car but you wanted electric right actually i during that time by also doing the business about the charging station so you have the charging station but you don't have any evie how you test your system so i bought the cheaper one okay okay that make sense well interesting i think that'll be it yes so wow yeah about the degradation you know it might be worst case here we don't know yet but alice's introduce you see i never see this is a new record for me to see that particular agent so unfortunately i didn't bring my obd don't know maybe maybe next time i'll bring it or actually if you could just get one if someone there has it because we could i have leaf spine we could tap in cars to see all the data i bet you guys want to see it but okay yeah i think anyway that'll be for this this car so yeah interesting so thank you very much thank you thank you for coming and i hope you okay can bring tesla off you to talent yes whatever is my next one night are you mumble yeah so i will i have a plan how to convince elon and tesla to come to thailand it's actually a no-brainer for them date yeah but i'll be except covered in another so let's move over to the next part we just happen to be the i3,-1
Bjorn Nyland,PLqKx2qnB8Xv4UQsSC5Is-1xLNApnV0_cm,jhGUzoaHEAg,okay we are now in bangkok so last episode we were in chiang mai now we are here it's nice and warm outside yes let's see well it's 7:30 in

check here oh it should be here soon it's gone there let me just adjust here sorry for that it's a little bit it just came a little bit unexpected so the the grub car is here soon the honda jazz yes yes so since we are four people then it actually pays off to use the car i guess otherwise we could use bts which is skytrain yeah we might explore that also here's our drive cup down i'm gonna hold it just wow this is the first time i ride it yes unfortunately no evs around here yet [music] [music] what we are here now it's just so crowded everywhere let's not get lost here what tag okay so many

chinese people all right huh okay where do duty on duty on this is dried durian 5x5 get one free what the heck we are in mid-november and it's already christmas over here man this place this place is texas yes it's completely texas i'm not sure what the ladies are looking for maybe shopping or food maybe both of that yes follow them i let me show you guys this well this is the first time i've been here i've been in thailand many times i've never seen such a crowded market wow who is that brown suit wow okay so i guess we have clothes here lots of stuff clothes accessories food you find everything here [music] [music] this is so busy here so much people here but anyway let's try detritus which is insects yes why or on it and then a hidden yeah look lambani you know okay you know if you want to solve the world's food problem you have to eat on the lowest lowest in the food chain which is good very salty good oh yes we ordered ribs not very co2 friendly and then cut in in papaya pineapple as so they also provide us with some gloves this could be messy gloves on it's daeun right okay yes the cadet that will not this oh [music] oh tasted a little bit spicy a little sour sweet

energy from so i just finished eating i'm stuffed and i kind of feel i want to rest but these guys oh yes so this place closes at 1:00 a.m. and it's about 8:00 now yeah so this is gonna take a while oh man i'm just so shot now in my legs and it's hot here even an evening it's about 30 degrees celsius so i purchased this one which is a waste and portable fan yes oh so nice yeah so it runs on batteries of course same way did i switch it off and i also bought this one which is a power bank so i figured i need to upgrade it so what i about is that it shows staler charging percentage and also when you plug in you can see how many amps is cooling and i wondered the one with the usb see so this one has usb c input and output and stuff because wife is iphone 11 has all the usb c to the lightning cable and more and more stuff you know relies on usb see us busy is the future the usb a should be phased out eventually but it's gonna take a long time so now i'm just waiting for one of the massage people there to be finished and i will get some foot massage oh yes much much better than aha wifey and her sisters they could just go shopping oh i could just stay here all day well maybe not all day but at least half an hour i'd rather want to stay at one hour but we'll see yeah how long i can stay here oh that was great so you know i had a massage here for about half an hour and then the clock i call wifey and asked her if she was done and she says she wasn't done yet so i said oh come on cam i got me a little gift here so i extended i actually stayed upon our man this is really good i need to charge my batteries so of course i get an tip and on thai people they don't make too much money so get a little extra and it was a hundred baht to the massage lady yeah you have to give it honey directly to her because then it goes directly to her so i see that they are starting to shut down here it's what the time i think it's midnight wife is done yeah so i will just go to the restroom and then we head back to the hotel okay back in hotel room the couch is kind of pricey unless you go for smaller rooms yeah but what yes anyway tomorrow i'm supposed to meet some some people tesla however gev people they exist in bangkok supposedly there's someone be the model x a model s corner or something so yes we will have a meet-up in bangkok that's going to be the first time so let's see i want to know how is it to drive electric here tesla's well there's probably no problem actually i want to know what about people with tesla when they have issues because those testers are portrait so there is no official service center here what are they gonna do then we will find out i guess that will be in a separate so that's gonna be it so now i hope you guys enjoy this as always thank you for watching and talk to you later,-1
Bjorn Nyland,PLqKx2qnB8Xv4UQsSC5Is-1xLNApnV0_cm,a-LrsresGaA,alright the next owner here is why you guys can guess this is the i3 yes oh well what was your name my name is pasok buzzer yes and you nick your nickname come down yeah dumb dumb dumb yeah dump dump yeah it's a dump truck thai people that have funny names me um but anyway so yeah we are now sitting in the i3 as which battery is this one is a 60 m okay yeah all the first generation yeah the first-generation 2014 wow wow since when did you have it but i owned it for about two and a half year ok i think sit in great what we call it gray market oh yeah silver here for about a year i think it shipped from hong kong so the first time that i got the car is 100 kilometer of course is brand new wow but i look up on the address book and i saw some shiniest name on the address book someone just saved our case it from china hong kong hong kong yes is yongkang because china has the steering wheel on this side but hong kong has it there so all the all the cars in the grey markets in thailand these type of cars they are from hong kong so that means it's been sitting somewhere for several years i think so yeah by the time that i got the car the capacity of the battery it's about 18.6 kilowatt hour that's almost full on the last name ok that was in 2000 2006 yeah 16 6 16 ok so over two and a half years and how is it now then it's 16.9 wow that the condom just be calf tur what they call the initialization ok the first drop yeah the first drop to about 13 9 and then i just read a blog on the ice reward facebook page that's someone just used a software to reset it seems bmw use the software i can assume it to tap every year so once you reset that value then it came up oh so it's 16.9 yeah after the reset well that is a lot better than the leaf next verse here i think so giving me how hot yeah because this one has active cooling yes and how hot can it be here in nothing so in a normal summer the air temperature could be up to 40 go but you can imagine the concrete road and it get or the sunlight all the time so you gotta heat yes if it's 40 in the air concrete i mean or the concrete or torment might be 50 or 60 degrees them and you can it is amazing for me you know we have some sky road oh yeah when it comes to the shed the range increased immediately from the calculation by about 15 percent but one we can't bind to the sun light it's dropped again so what is amazing to see that on the road oh i to share it so you actually for you it's better to not take the expressway yeah absolutely i mean i better wet i mean maybe more traffic getting to that same destination maybe half an hour later but i got a more power so what is the range you usually get then on a full charge a 110 hundred twenty okay kilo meter that's not too bad the aveda asc always on yeah i normally turn the ac off ten minutes before i reach the destination but it doesn't save much be smiling i think it's more efficient yeah okay so on do you how far do you usually drive today less than 60 kilometers a day i nobody charge every day at home okay so you have a home charging station yeah and you just charge do you charge anywhere outside of homeland not really there was a time that i got a public charge of not actually the free one but wanek once i come back to the home the the charging pod turned red and i felt panic no because there might be some i don't know what's gonna happen thank god everything went back okay when i get back to home charge it everything is normal the sometimes just scared i don't know i don't know if i can rely on the public charger here because is this the is this the only car or which the other car yes i have another card fossil yeah so but you used to use the i3 for commuting or back yeah from home to work yeah but not of course not outside bangkok okay yeah naturally not with this car yeah and back when you bought it in 2006 16 how much did you pay for it in taipa this is okay yeah it's 2.2 million baht oh that's not too bad not too bad mm-hmm because if you buy a new one i think you had to pay twice that amount i wasn't i think its new but it's just because of the gray market yeah but during that the same time as you said if i bought the official one that imported by bmw it could be double oh ok awesome reasons i think you are still fighting how texts work here yeah yeah what's this here so you bought more and did you have any issues with the car so far i have two issues and of course it's not a issue one of them is the 1200 battery the small one is depleted oh i see that in the i3 group yes and i don't know how about tesla that it doesn't really give you enough notification i think i got it just one day before that it had the low power and i was thinking okay maybe i can survive for another day and on the second day in the next morning i was thinking to bring it to the collage it's died don't it's completely dead oh but it has the image in secrecy or where thanks god i have the charger at home you plug in the main power leave it for an hour and you get the 12 for charged at the minimum that many features in the car the screen looks different it turned emergency mode something that but it's enough for you to drive to the collage and get it replaced okay the screen looks strange it it's it's activated some emergency mode but at least you know there should be lots of bmw garage repair shop yes yes even the one the grey market that i bought from them they are so clever they are so smart i think they can fix a lot of things in this car because i forgot to mention about another issue the charging part it did not charge oh okay when i plug in it said the main power is low i don't know what the heck it is okay that it got enough charge to go to reset that graham i get and they fix it without any cost it took a little a okay but it doesn't mean that when you have issues can you go to the regular p.m. premier i phone up a few dealers they refused oh it's that now really about if you bought it from them dennis huh they will does what's up with that i know but just to be fair with them you know they got a lot of money yeah okay well interesting so there's a you are actually take a little bit of risk by buying from the not as risk as buying his love but yeah i'm glad you asked asked question yeah it's not super risky hmm but so overall what do you think about the i3 david are you happy with the purchase yes i'm very happy i'm still a big fan of tesla of course but i work in a german company they sent me to munich i visited bmw museum i saw how much they care about the environment using this karl lykos environmental friendly materials yeah give me some deeper meaning about driving this car but yeah overall technology wise tesla always be my best card did you try just before i tried yes yeah okay well that's great very interesting to hear about owners perspective here in thailand of course so anyway and thank you so much thank you can tell yeah a couple cars coming down to you yes thank you for showing me the car and all that yeah by the way there's some stuff in the back here it's yeah moving the company it just left the old company on friday i think i just keep everything here yeah 42 inches monitors office office chair so comfy i want to bring it to the new companies or keep it here alright so i think that's it done and now let's move over to the test loss,4
Bjorn Nyland,PLqKx2qnB8Xv4UQsSC5Is-1xLNApnV0_cm,TrMZNIs1vDU,right the last car i want to in the last car all i want to into you today is the ionic owner yes so this is my one of my favorite cars as you guys know i'm so happy to see i only in thailand so anyway and you what is your name by the way my name is cole go yes and you have well you have a unique ice wizard so how long did you own this car it's about one and a half years one and a half years and this is this is the classic ionic that 28 kilo of years and the first day i think you are one of my longtime followers yes it's because of the the cliff that compared between ione and live and in winter yes yes yes i was a race yes yes the the restaurant and yeah i only come to thailand and this is the first ionic in thailand this is the first one yes this is legendary yeah so wow so you own this car for one and a half years that was in 2000 and in the beginning of 2018 yes me wow so how much did you pay for it then 1.7 for the solo face that's not too bad 1.7 kids it's more expensive than a typical honda civic over there it's about the same price as the accord hybrid in thailand okay yeah but uh could it's a bigger car a lot but you wanted to go for the electric need yes hmm so you live in bangkok right and how far do you drive every day less than 100 kilos wow okay yeah in town i live in south waves of bangkok and go in town about 60 kilos back and forth okay do you take the highway all souls and do you do drive and how do you try to save try to save energy or this is very efficient car i drive in bangkok what you know a lot of traffic you cannot move much oh you're back up traffic yes i think i can push this car so as far as i want and it's still very efficient okay watch yeah needless to say that's that's ionic so when you drive on let's say do you take the expressway or almost every time what is the speed limit on there presley diligo it 90 but 90 okay we know it's 120 been foolish cash okay awesome most people they drive at 110 know what they were yeah change late 20 so that means even when you drive on the highway what kind of range do you get then you have this typical for highway 230 oh wow that much wow okay and who 20 to 30 is safe say branch to 20 to 30 kilometers that's good and what about city mix 240 to 450 okay this confirms what i thought which is that evs they perform better in hot climate thailand rather than in cold climates so in norway not that great even in most of europe but here you know there's a good general misconception that if you use evi in hot climate you will have shitty range no it's just nice and hot you've run the air conditioning which takes almost nothing yeah but if i turn off the aircon i can go maybe to 80s okay but it's not that much to gain but you have you owned this car for one year and how far did you drive then about twenty thousand killed twenty thousand was 70 mm gene yeah eighteen yeah well that's okay decent it means that you also drive another car right yes okay but do you do this one is just for commuting or do you want just for me oh i'm gonna go alone get my family i have two cars okay and so you use the other car for long trips and yes yeah for long got you and do you have any problems with this car so far so far no the only one problem yes there's a rat go to bite my oh sh wire a rut what happened then so the solenoid why is broken they replay and replace it but it was was it the warren c or e is not on volunteer but it's under insulin okay so there was a wire why i broke into the air cornish oh oh that's okay it's a tactic it's not something wrong with the car it's just so wow so you've been driving one and a half year with no you didn't have a problem with the the door handle maybe it has something to do with all climate because lots of people in norway are getting it okay interesting um but when you bought the car did you buy it from a dealership or a hyundai thailand who not official-official so it means that you have official repair support just for it and how many i mean do you have many dealerships that's a lot okay but normally you have to go to the headquarter for for the mansion end okay but actually there's a dealership in thailand oh so wow okay so that's better so this one is not a gray market car that's that's good wow and do you when you drive do you have any days where you have to fast charge oh i know but try the faster in thailand because it's not open mineko and most of the fish are still not open okay but why did you do you don't need to about there i can try at home i have 22 kilowatt wow what you're ready on the future you're ready for tesla yes yep by the way thailand has a three phase four on the vault and of course 230 volts so really good for electric mobility unlike us well okay so one last thing i want to know is that so you bought the ionic what what yeah why did you buy your own it by the way and not leave for i dream is actually because of pure evil okay and that's at that time there not much choice in thailand there's an ionic and the ionic might be the first official car share in thailand oh because buckton leaf wasn't here yet yes oh you must be the gray market the imported cars with no official opponent and the price is okay yeah not that bad so i buy it mmm-hmm but it's overall are you happy with the car yes i'm really happy so it wouldn't be anything you would mm-hmm okay cool this is nice it's so no it's red i'm so happy that we have ionic driver in thailand also and it's a good choice okay one last thing before i forget about it is do you feel any degradation with the car so far you mean a battery near the battery no not yet no okay yeah i can go to 230 without worries right now so you feel when today worse is one and a half years ago it's not the same not significant yeah okay again confirmed my suspicions but anyway thank you so much for the view so man ionic yeah the classic i only of course don't buy the new one okay but anyway i think that's gonna be it for now very interesting good insight to see about car different cars in thailand and one day i might be driving an eevee in thailand myself and that'll be a new chapter in this okay so doesn't be written i hope you guys enjoyed this as always thank you for watching and talk to you later,-1
Bjorn Nyland,PLqKx2qnB8Xv4UQsSC5Is-1xLNApnV0_cm,HRxcIy9Eess,we are now in pattaya so i will start this episode by showing guys the room i'm quite happy with this room so let's start ken this is bit weird because i use the osmo pocket yes very nice and tiny let me see this over here so there's actually the that's the the osmo pocket i'm shooting from right now it's pretty cool can see i have two there go flip mod okay so let me show you guys the room this one cost about two thousand baht per night which is about 60 euros quite good price for western people yeah so it has a nice big bed and over here we have coffee machine and stuff you see very common in thailand you have to have a minibar or a fridge let me just check out what they have in the fridge i hope this is a bit clumsy so i have to do it this and then we open the fridge okay well this is not included so you have to pay if you want to drink some of these these goodies okay anyway let's sleep what i about this room is that okay if we look here okay this is the bathroom we have to open this one oops oops and very common in thailand that you have nice toilet with okay not heated seat but we have this thing here the butts briar oh yes i love it i love it and it has a shower plus a bathtub so that's a shower how or why but supposedly you can sit in the shower also if you and here we have the bathtub no sonar no fancy stuff here no massage but at least we can shower it simultaneously so that's good let me check here by the way okay yeah yeah good stuff it's okay let me show you guys outside okay woosh woosh that's that's wifey they have a safe over there and all that so this is a sea views it costs slightly more we have a sofa nice nice space i'll show you guys before okay but let's go outside we also have a nice balcony here yeah look at that sea view man okay let's go outside so oh it's nice and hot outside so here we have two chairs and a marie sisters they are on that room over there yeah we can just shout to each other i yeah and here's the view that's pattaya okay speedboats over there we have another hotel here that looks a boat yes well it's getting old yeah looks a bit old oh wow it's so nice and hot outside here oh okay and if you look down missy and i'm navigating this yeah okay there you go but to try to maneuver so we're there son there's a pool right outside here and the entrance mmm so yes the plan now well i'm not sure what the plan is but let me see i mean do the flip mode here wait three times come on it's supposed to flip back no it doesn't flip for some reason yeah i don't know what the heck is wrong we centered every center okay there there it flipped oh okay but i guess we'll ask the group that began what we'll do today i feel having another massage back massage this time and we should have some food and relax there will probably not be too much evie content here unfortunately for you guys but oh i can i can talk to this camera also so let's figure out what to do that chair the gang is out yes so anyway we want to chill at the beach and the macan c'mon man but across the road so this is what they are for you guys who don't know it's very tourist place so you know yes if you hear if you hear that one norwegian guy is going to pattaya then that means he's looking for a happy ending right but for me i'm thai that's completely different yes so anyway we are going to the beach which is right over here oh yeah look at our let's get some food well actually just chill grab some food and whatever so let's go [music] okay let's this is the start turn which is insects oh look at those oh yes and even sure i know but no okay well there's just cricket or crickets this is cricket let's have a handful of crickets all right mmm one the factor this is good source of protein yes so i should be co2 neutral now by eating crickets mmm-hmm okay let's do this inside shall we yeah annie dumb tie a neat dump and in it some time now for me young heroes you knew it mmm [music] hmm a little powerful some mother [music] wow it gets dark quite fast here yes within half an hour boom is dark so now the plan is to go back to hotel i want to wash my hands i wonder what people do when they come here and if they were they are far away from the hotel but we've been eating some food finger food so fortunately we have the hotel right nearby you see this is the i think they call it the beach road and our hotel is just right over there yes that i chose this location because of that so let's follow the ladies oh man okay we're back oh doctor what tech bucket hotel and i've been bombarded by mosquitoes already look here i don't know what the heck happens every time i get bitten it just swallows i mean it's kind of swollen upload whatever but this one this matter what this medicine here is brilliant i buy it in thailand it works great so it will reduce the itching almost immediately within 15 minutes then 18 is gone and then this one is to prevent most needles from biting me again so it's probably so toxic that you can't buy it in norway so the more toxic the better so first i will apply this one to get rid of the itching and then we apply the other one and then be good for hitting their streets i think we're gonna go to market or something yes oh but i don't know what's up with those mosquitos they love my sweet blood yes my sweet viking blood oh so i just put this on and it works magic oh yes okay we're out in the wild wilderness again yeah so same procedure we come to this marketplace the girls they want to go shopping i'm not sure what i would do let me show you guys yeah so stuff very cheap check it out where did the ladies go now i think they went this way yes they're over here clothes more clothes obsessed with i was told that most of this stuff is for women and then a little bit of stuff for guys i guess so yeah what did they say happy wife happy life so yeah compared to the bangkok night market it's a bit pricy here so i think we're just gonna do window shopping oh man the previous location apparently wasn't the good market place so we went to a different one this is called tip zip is it something or actually they call it the lat why yeah a local name so y means buffalo yeah me i'm quiet yeah so anyway the ladies again wriggle stop you know i thought they were supposed to whether they go now no i thought it location is supposed to be chill time apparently not we're out all day shopping running around so now how to find my bodies [music] [applause] [music] oh man we are finding the way home now so on the way back now we use weights and they call it pop song count which is basically to the pickup and we sit behind their safety is ish yeah not safe at all but whatever this is trial on only so we they call it mao which is that we hire the whole car so they don't take in the detours well we don't have well we could probably take a taxi but we try this one now okay we're back here now at the beach road so i think for future reference so we will try to avoid this this song town or the the pickup trucks it's much safer to sit in the taxi and also way more comfortable because you have air conditioning so in here is just ambient temperature which is 25 to 28 degrees celsius so anyway now we're still not done yet the ladies they are going through to 7-eleven yeah so we need to get some supplies some goodies then they will i think we'll have some some mukbang in in the hotel's room this is funny because there's glass here just separating the bathroom and the rest of the room so we said okay there is enough privacy in there that's the bathroom inside there right so let's say why she was showering there and she didn't want me to see her well all i can do is this who the heck designed this thing oh miss it wait push okay but anyway i think that'll be it for now if this episode hope you enjoy this as always thank you for watching and talk to you later,-1
Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK1K85QpQ4hgvwkrBZlis8MD,Dw9IuvJCDbs,"this is the perse e308 and don't worry it's another stallant scoup car but it's not the usual 50 kwh in the same motor this thing has a 73 k battery and then there's a near 100 k battery coming out soon clearly it's an suv it's quite tall it's chunky it's for a family so compared to what is out there especially the recently reviewed from our point of view anyway renault 6 which was probably the benchmark in family evs how does it fair the front is very pesque it says the name of the carat on the front instead of the back and of course youve got this rather cool grill i do persia's design language the proportions and the height of this suv do make it look very bulky and well it's just a tall car and as a well personally anyway not a fan of suvs it's never going to be a goodlook car but i don't think they've done too bad in what they've got to work with you can see the height and again i'm not a tall person by any means but the 38 i could reach the middle of the roof good for cleaning not going to happen the doors again really tall oh every time every time the doors they're heavy i have to say and when we parked on a bit of a slope my daughter genuinely couldn't it's it's too heavy can you get out and do it for me i the fact that this covers the seal though so you don't get dirty ankles when you get in and out the back again it is a family car reasonable entry not as good as some of the other ones in terms of getting it child seat in the back charge port is here quite a large door and again this is not a stellantis group clone it can do much faster charging more on that later though cool lights from the back but i look at this and just think flat which i guess is practical it's about interior space it's about the boot space you've got no rear wiper that will annoy a few people and you've even got one of these things which works every single time i've tried it the boot nice and flat in terms of no lip but you' got a huge bit of bumper sticking out there which well i'm glad it's a different color because that's probably going to get scratched it's not the biggest but it's perfectly acceptable for a family car you'll get a pram you're shopping all the usual stuff and under here which has a little bit of a a shelf there to keep it out of the way this is more of a step up for perso it's not just a taller 308 it's definitely more of a luxury curious entry and the price kind of reflects that right well normally i would shut the door but i want to start with this cuz i said it was heavy and it is heavy and they've only got a little handle so you end up doing this a bit so this anyway is the perso interior you've got the usual small steering wheel that persos do now where you have to look over it to see the dash and all the display and everything else which some people don't and there's a lot of adjustment in this there's a lot of adjustment in the seats which we show you in a minute um so i don't mind it at all but again get into it and see what you think before you buy one turn the car on and the first thing that's evident is this beautiful floating screen as it appears there it's it's just a one piece even though it's two screens they've not done the bezel thing they've not got a gap it's just really well integrated i do that an awful lot and the materials that you can see here just carry on through the cabin it's a fabric effect this you won't be a to tell fully on camera it's led back lit and it changes depending on the drive mode you got some softish materials there leather here although it is a top spec car of course reasonable switch gear they're not bad and the doorbin is about the only bit where you get the had wearing plastic although it is felt lined in the front the center console is a bit of a strange one now this is not a groundup ev it has a petrol version for example so maybe you've got all this dead space down here because of that but it is quite well used so this tapers towards the driver and you got the drive modes you got volume control here some controls here for your climate control which is quite nice and effective and under there you've got your wireless charging pad for your phone which means it's hidden away and you always forget it when you get out of the car now i'm going to have to ask aric to show you another bit of storage because it's a bit of a strange placement there for the driver you can't really reach it very well there we go but it's got a lot of storage you've got a couple of usies in there and 12 volt just down there as well so it's some nice hidden close storage which is a good thing because the glove box is only half width that's awful isn't it that is really so unnecessary but it's the left hand drive right and drive conversion of course here though you've got some storage which is a good thing because of the glove box of course and it's really deep cu all the way down and harry you love this wow it's cooled you put your beer in there this is really nice nice is it that's really nice almost a uh speaker grill effect isn't it there yeah yeah so that that that for me is definitely step up over the 308 oh definitely yeah and this is lovely look at that i really do that and here you've got some more buttons which you can customize so i can do that hold it down and then replace it for something else i think something that we need to including all car reviews especially now the rulers come into play you on that and then you on lo keep assist and then you on confirm so that's a three button push to turn it off every time you get in one too many it is a bit so you've pressed the button which brings up oh these and you can adjust the bolsters so if you sit back you want cat paw snake i mean there's loads of them you can literally choose for the driver and the passenger in this gt spec of course with the seats so it's very noisy isn't it they are noisy though all you can hear is the motors pumping the air in and then it going i'm i've done long journeys in this car it it does well you need music pretty it sounds an iron lung now it does come with an optional i'll call it sunroof rather than panoramic but it is quite a dark place as you get in modern cars these days now seat position that you were in before which is a normal comfortable sort of you know adult position what's the room a bit tight i'll be honest with you i was expecting a lot more than that and you know what is very weird look how high i'm set up compared to the front passenger it's a tall car though isn't it i expected more from the size of it but i think that's cost i mean the length of the bonnet is huge huge bonnet so i think it's one of those where you've got the the high compromise yeah i think to be honest with you it's going to be two people in the back of this there's not it's a flat fl in the back yeah in the middle that's that's a bit of a stretch for an adult isn't it so short journeys for three kids maybe uh but two kids in the back okay i think two kids in the back two adults in the back for shorter journeys depending on how big the driver and passenger are better package alternative so far it's a nice place to be it's just there is it's just in terms of yeah space you'd expect more it's all in the front is the is where this car's at which a family car it needs to have yeah yeah well we're talking about technology it's got the lan keep assist autopilot equivalent yeah so it's and i've done lots of motorway journeys in this and the red ey gr did things fine you know they all do that prett well it's been around long enough usually it reachs 60 and tesla does this and other cars do this but not as much as this does i've had 80 really as in when it goes oh press okay and i'll do the spe know that you can't do 80 in the uk anyway it said eight eight wow it was 60 but it's red 8 and 80 several times on one trip what it needs is a pair of these with teslas and other cars the time sometimes read a side road yeah whereas this seems to misre sign which is very strange isn't it going to blow your mind we're going to start this group car and as we said it's not just got the same battery and the same motor but flappy paddles flappy paddles for regen they do you know what they've actually listened to our videos yeah it just must be it's just us now we mentioned the charging before uh when i were outside 160 kow but it never went above 70 odd kow so i don't know disappointing i don't know if that was the charger though which was a 150 kow charger just to be clear now the price so we're in the 73 k usable capacity version just over 200 brak horsepower which is is enough seems nippy enough yeah but this is a in terms of list 45 to 50 grand car in reality there's only a couple of grand discounts so at the moment at the moment yeah we might see that come down over time so so you're looking at let's say between 40 and 50,000 car depending on on spec the cheapest i found this the gt with without the leather the nappa leather seats was 45 but that's only a couple of grand discount still quite a lot you know what it's a lot of money for a perso i don't know if perso have sort of hit this sort of a lot of manufacturers seem to be doing that though don't they where they're well let's just it has to be that price for the battery size and so for so let's mention that now it's not as good as a scenic it's got slightly better range because of the bigger batteries of course but that didn't have a short one hands down on every metric for me would you go for something an enyak over this be in mind that's going to be a 5 10 grand cheaper again i' probably so if we go for the bigger probably would yeah it's a bigger car isn't it this this feels luxurious especially with you know the nappa seats and the uh the massage function definitely but that's not standard spec is it do you think a lot of the uh space with this car is taken up with the the bonnet it's a huge bonnet isn't it the bonnet it's it's massive isn't it it's a lot of space there where you just you could you know you could move the cockpit f further forwards now they're also bringing out a dual 36 break h power dual motor version of this is it is it necessary it's not sps c even buying this to to drive fasting no and well the handling for example it's fine but it is a big lumbering suv 2.1 tons 2.1 tons and that's in this battery version the bigger one will heavier i mean the performance is fine oh yeah in this it's got enough pull hasn't it i mean for 200 break it's front wheels scrambling there for traction um now over the last 8113 miles i've done in this wow all these press cars are thousands of miles off my car sav your fortune yeah uh i've averaged 3.6 m per k about 15 to 20° temperature in fact no 15 16 yeah not brilliant but not terrible kind of this size right yeah 210 250 yeah let's say 210 to 250 all year round average i think that's that's as an average oh another thing that i what they've done with this and the other stant stuffs that we've reviewed i think michelin tires oh well you can tell c you yeah we it's quiet yeah we've always gone for michelin tires aren't we again long before we even started doing out with youtube so i always look for that with a manufacturer if you they never have cheap ones do they but sometimes you're i wish there i think you notice with manufacturers now there's brands that are mid-range brands yeah and i think you definitely want a premium tire on year abely it does it's it's a car you don't want to cut really is it it's a comfortable car again all the motare journeys i've been on i've had no issues at all so i don't think there are many objections with that the handling is i would as i would expect in terms of the size of the thing um do you just think that is this a family car it is just that you could it's compromised isn't it well i feel you could get the same sort of uh interior space with a smaller car yeah yeah yeah the id3 probably has comparable space to this yeah and look at the size difference it's it's a yeah i mean it's got a decent is it but it's again it's not made the best use of the length for the vehicle of it is a long car so no there's there's a few things that others do better and again we go back to it all the time though it's not what this offers it's what other cars that's slightly better do better especially at the 40 to 50 grand price packet cuz entering premium well model three yeah yeah model 3 long range if you spec it up it's similar price model y yeah uh and i know we always mention the teslas but let's face the ben the benchmark in most people's heads um then you've got things your ionic sixes and ionic fs which are probably cheaper at the entry point you've got the renault scenic which is definitely cheaper and a brilliant and probably better space at the back ford explorer which is the id4 um the enyak again yeah this is so much isn't there in this in this price they a little bit cheaper at the entry level the one thing i want to mention before we set off yeah do you fall out of this car because it's so it's such a long wide lck yeah it's not the easiest the sill i'm trying to think the sill's wide and the door you high up and you my my one won't get in i think if you has mobility problems it's going to be my won't get into this easily at all no would you say then that there are reasons to get this over others um yeah the interior might be the way the exterior looks nice but for the large suv for me it is a large suv it but just seems to take too much away from the passengers in the rear which i think if you get in this car it's it's you're not going to not have kids are you it's a family car isn't it unless it's not it's not a c it's not coupe is it but it's got almost coupes proportions in the re yeah yeah i'll tell you what it's really nice having these sloppy paddles yeah really does make a difference but we're going downhill now and it's a maximum regen take off the the break some cars you're almost stopping downhill so there's there's a little tweak we would if the engine are still watching us for future tips if they could do that we would more regen more yeah heavier regen i mean at the moment it says we've got 63% left 169 mile range so again 3.6 mil per k hour and that's mostly mwe journeys to be fair so around town it should get well over that in summer around town this is 300 mile e yeah just about and again the bigger batch of version will be even higher than that begs a question do you need the bigger back i don't think so there's only going to be a travel in salesman type person what what family would need that bigger battery more powerful dual motor version you wouldn't would you but is it just cu well it's easy for us to do just tesla do it just other manufacturers give you it i wonder if it's i mean we could both charge at home yeah you take that away true true that's a good point you don't have to charge as often if you got a bigger battery yeah quite on the motorway i can tell um little bit of wind noise though i think you can hear that from the sides of this car um and a little bit tyo so i would say it's in the middling of the ev quietness scale yeah we need an ev scale for quietness we do so part of me thinks you know what if you buy this you will it as long as you don't get in some of the other cars we've mentioned it's not a car that i'd recommend off for a family i think unless you the looks of something i think well i think you're getting this based on your the looks yeah and and it will fit a family he not bad just there's better better out there yeah so it will suit you if you think no i that as in the looks or something you know there's some part of this you it's a good car it's a very good car again a lot of the persia though it is very likable yes it is just something yeah that isn't i can't put my oh that's a speed camera bong lots of bongs lots of bongs yeah i can't just quite put my finger on what it is but there is something about it i'm going quite this i think the thing is if you've got quite i mean it's not a totally dark interior this brightens it up but there's just a lot of black anday yeah i think having uh having having a glass uh what is it called panoramic sunroof having a paranoid sunroof paranoid sunroof having a panoramic sunroof or just panoramic roof just make a lot of difference it does yes definitely not par especially people in the back but it only goes back to there it's not a panoramic for me it's a sun roof it is just above the uh again it's spoiling the people in front and forgetting about the people in the back yeah i tell you along these roads though i have to say i'm getting a bit of boob jiggle it's a bit uh jarry isn't it it's not quite as soft as unsettled i would have thought yeah go far s and settled yeah so on most roads it's actually comfortable but this is granted it's a typical british sort of pot area y so then what food what food is this oh we're running out of things to to think about a cheap pot noodle oh it tries to be a pot noodle but it isn't but it isn't you're a supermarket equivalent yeah i've got supermarket equivalent pot noodle yes or cheap super noodles the originals the best oh yeah it's tasty it taks the boxes of what you expect from a pot noodle fake it's a fake pot noodle it's a fake pot noodle 15% behind what you what you would expect from pot noodle right well the one thing that you will not be disappointed with on every tick box is of course the membership 99 p a month wow and i have to say because i'm a bit of a referral h tesla started their referrals again have they yeah so uh we've both got tesla's referrals in the link um so no ultimately i think we've been a little unfair with this cuz it is a nice car i do it i just would choose other cars other cars yeah and we say that a lot of the we do yes but it will a lot of people will get this and i think be be happy with it so i think so so there we go that is the p p thanks for watching yes oh sorry i forgot to thank my viewers yeah i'll thank them instead thanks for watching and uh watch us again on the other sometimes no we don't use that anymore don't use that we're going put for ages the podcast for ag don't watch yeah we need to do that as well god aren't we organized no",-1
Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK1K85QpQ4hgvwkrBZlis8MD,RAevvNIhX6M,"this is the full electric 308 the e38 and we're going to review this in a little bit of a different style because what we're going to do is just concentrate on the estate version that's not because the hatch is wildly different it's because the hatch has so much competition that when you look at it and we'll explain what we mean throughout this it's kind of in the middle it's lost in the wilderness there's cars that are more efficient quicker more practical better value so it's just another option a good looking option but there's so many other choices would probably pick them in a state world though in electric cars there's very few options so this shines a lot a lot more brightly it's a lot better if you think of it purely as an estate so that's what we're going to look at it as and for £1,000 extra for the estate over the hatch it's worth every penny now before we go through its merits let's have a look around it and then we'll go inside and have a look around the interior to see how it matches to the other stuff on the market and of course other stellantis cars this for me is the best looking one perse for the last few years have just got it right you've got actual style not everyone will it of course but look at the grill normally with cars you'd have a bits you a few bits of plastic going from left to right it's just design thought it's got very ponus i'm going to use that one where it's classless and that's very hard to achieve expensive house cheap house it would fit on anybody's driveway the way that the lights kind of slightly recess and the do a little bit of a a dance as most cars do these days when you turn them on it isn't a ground pv it comes in all three forms the first pers to do so petrol hybrid electric but there's a there's a big bonnet there so the astra i'm expecting we're going to lose a bit of interior space due to that not ground up evus now if you watch the you'll know that due to my age i prefer in a state to a hatchback and especially to an suv and this has got proper estate proportions i'm only a little look at my legs but even i can reach and clean the top of the car it it's it's a good size it's what cars used to be rather than these mammoths that are this tall and really wide no chrome no tacky bits it's got a bit of style to it i it god's sake it does have that annoying habit of locking and unlocking every time you walk past it the rear entry is average in terms of getting car seats in and out cuz it is let's face it's a family sort of car nice to see some decent tires as well more michelins and look at this crease comes from the lights goes in and then disappears and then comes back again and meets the other lights at the back so there's only so much you can do with what is typically a flatbed car but they've actually achieved some element of design here you got a bit of a spoiler this lip that comes out with the perse badge just tucked underneath this big recess is a bit strange i'm not sure about that one cuz it gives you a large load lip into the boot and i have to call pers out on this design decision what on earth are you doing on this full electric car with these sort of fake exhausts what's going on here now of course it is an estate so the boots ever important part of that it's in the usual place unfortunately is the button so you're going to get filthy fingers when you go in the back but it's a good size a little bit smaller than the aster estate but bigger than the mg5 nice and flat entry just this lip's quite large other than that again very usable there are bigger cars out there of course in terms of boot space and whatnot but in terms of this class the price brackets all that this is uh more than acceptable okay we'll start off with what is a small steering wheel so this is a new modern pue thing you don't look through the steering wheel you have to look over it so some people may find that getting this into position and it's fully adjustable as is the seat um it's it can be a bit of an odd one so so i i would suggest you sit in a perse and just see if it works for you other than that though the steering wheel feels okay it's not premium but it's not cheap either and you got some decent sort of feeling buttons as well the door cards that's kind of soft that's an alcanta effect soft again soft oh that's a bit hard leatherette average switch gear from stellatus group and a reasonable door bin you'll notice here we have a rather nice display and it's not just your display that you will get on a lot of cars these days that just shows you your speedometer if you press this here it cycles through various options which essentially means you've got a full virtual cockpit which is exactly what you should have from any modern car in my opinion so this i really do so you got this big screen here and some it's touchcreen but they're very big touchcreen buttons so you can easily get to them as a driver when you're not taking your eyes off the road so i don't mind that too much and this is okay it's reasonably quick it just takes a bit of get used to in terms of where things are and of course the car play takes care of most things you have buttons as well so if i press that it goes to the functions for turning lan keeper system various other things off and you got the climate control as well as a few other buttons demisters and turning it off moving to the center console unfortunately you do have a lot of dead space down here and it's kind of hard wearing plastic because it is of course not a ground up ev but this feels a lot nicer it's a metallic sort of plastic aair feels up market i do that and you got the usual switch gear for drive and reverse and that's your b mode as well which is okay more on that later you can put your phone there put it wirelessly charges up here um and you got an usy slot 12vt bit of close storage essentially and cup holders as well which you can close off if you wish back here you got a space for what i assume is for keys and of things and a bit of storage as well but that only goes that far down it's not very deep which means again anything below there all the way down is just essentially lost space due to the fact that they're having to accommodate a petrol engine and the glove box is glorious space full width it is ar that's quite a big one well i've been told that what do you think of the uh dash around there curves inside yeah yeah it's nice material as well it's rubberized nice bit of uh leather right there with some stitching so they've actually made it mar market feels premium doesn't it it does feel yeah i won't say it's luxury level luxury but it feels premium for for the price it's at this is the gt spec we should point out yeah bit of effort got into these is they yeah i do that comfier than the astra which had all the adjustments yeah now as you can see no panoramic sunroof and i don't believe it's an option either which means that this if you look at it it's quite a dark affair in a weird way it sort of suits the car but for me i do a c especially after the rena scenic recently i'll put a picture of that now yeah yeah it makes such a difference to a car's interior now in this estate we've seen the boot and that's pretty decent but the rear doesn't look massive to me it's not massive no it's all right yeah i think with some adjustment on the seat cuz i got my seat quite laid back at the moment just for filming i think you'd have a bit more space but i wouldn't want to be much taller than me no so it's two adults two teenagers and of course you' got the massive hump from the the compromised um chassis that we're we're having to deal with here from the group now because we've had the scenic recently i've been in that most of the week you've been in this most of the week and we've we've swapped but essentially you've done most of this how are what what are your thoughts on this the fact that you have to go over the steering whe have you might find a decent position cuz i found a real it's okay but i'm having to adjust it quite a bit i'm guessing you might have problems if you're sharing the car with somebody and you've got to move your seat up and down into another position well yeah we've just swapped and i'm having to move this up and down a little bit so the fact that it doesn't go back into your normal position and the fact there's no memory seats a it's a manual mo ian it goes up and down it's electric apart from going backwards and forwards so over the last 360 miles proof that we always properly test although it doesn't beat my 890 miles um uh 3.9 mes per kil which i don't think's too bad i mean the weather is what 17° it has been quite yeah yeah so it's it's it's dry mostly warm reasonable weather so let's go for uh same as the astra essentially we're looking at9 190 to 210 miles on average you will get more than that in summer around town you will get less than that on the motorway winter of course it's averages smack bang stantis group essentially effective because they've all using the same battery pretty much and this only comes in the uh the newer next generation battery version which is good and surprisingly efficient 100 kow charging of course yeah which is a bit of a it will do f in its side isn't it really it's not future proof is it really i mean the scenic i i did long journey i got from 37 kw and it sustained that for quite a bit it went to 90 for quite a bit higher than that and it's that it's the curve isn't it so the curve is more important than the the peak rate that we just mentioned but i would another 50 from the group and whilst i'm putting it into drive again paddles paddles for beam roe or at different and also different yeah some adjustment on the b mode because it is very puny isn't it yeah i want one pedal driving because it's a software option this time and time again they' got a virtual cockpit because well we've got a display the let's do that the information is in the car let's display whatever you want why not with regen surely that's purely software even just you could press the button three or four times and it toggles you don't have to be puddles just just you say b b1 b2 b3 something that i that interaction especially i think around here we've got so many steep hills i find myself going down the hill having use the brak as well which just seems sort of alien in in electric care let's put it into sport mode of course cuz that's the first thing you do as a man well that's it yeah yeah um now 150 od breake horsepower is not a lot but for a family car it's fine yeah so 30 m hour and it picks up again so there we go 50 yard yeah slow down to the corner um again they're are quicker the mean um in fact a lot of you know coa bn yeah id3 two certainly not slow yeah it's it's enough isn't it compared to the the six diesels that people tr around in then petol and whatnot it will feel quicker than them is this as quiet as the astro which was a quiet car it is a very quiet car isn't it nice i that i would say yeah it say yeah persos have always been pretty good on that haven't they a car we both owned in fact it was literally the same car it was one of the best handling cars yeah and yet it was one of most comfortable you remember it this is witchcraft and that was a 306 gti 6 a cracking car and pers have always been very good at the say on grand tour the shifter suspension yeah yeah yeah yeah um they they've always been very good at that haven't they with a slightly larger battery say if i had a 70 it would be a really good motorway car yes that is true now let's talk about the astra electric state because it's underneath it's it's literally the same thing isn't it yeah but same ingredients different chef yeah and this one is definitely well do you it it's it's me making a meal or my mom making a meal yeah yeah it's i can never get it how i'm us exactly you know it's the same thing and it's just a lot nicer however in reality in terms of actual price rather than list price you are paying 2 to 3,000 pound more for this than the astro electric is available for i do think that it is worth that premium without a doubt it's it's a lot nicer place to be and i think it will be worth a bit more at the end yeah you know when you come to trade in or whatever so you'll see a lot of that back i think if if price is an issue for you get the mg5 if it's if it's coming down just to price only yeah get mg5 yeah yeah if you want to save money save money yeah because there's about a n grand difference between the mg5 in real prices anyway not less prices than this so this starts at i think it's 38 a2 and goes up to 40 odd n um so i found this gt version mhm for just over 30 grand wow i mean at that price now again 27 in a bit for the astros day yeah yeah 20 for the for the mg5 state again i think for me you go for the mg5 or you go for this yes so ultimately the astr in the middle it's lost yeah the reason why we're not mentioning the hatchback is because of the competition yeah just quite frankly two much isn't there yeah that are better in many ways so let's start with the stellantis group alone citron ec4 over the hatchback of this i would go for that uh the jeep a lot of money go for the it's difference in suv i' probably go for the jeep because it's just yeah yeah i would probably because the uniqueness of this for me and the thing i is the estate the estate yeah once you've got rid of that then it's not really it's not special asra i would probably go for this even in hatchback form uh the mocker and all that will leave so other cars coa born id3 go for the ca b absolutely y and the new id3 the first definitely mg4 lot cheaper lot cheaper yep so again this you could se out we could keep going there's so many there that it just becomes becomes white noise unless you the look of this yeah then then that's i think that's a selling point and it's not a bad car is it i mean it's comfortable it's it's it's a very goodlooking car for me it taks a lot of boxes it's just they're probably cheaper more practical faster more efficient etc etc blah blah blah the trouble is now though is that the estate used to be or the wagon used to be quite a a big thing we were growing up didn't it because you didn't have an suv no they've taken over now the suv is taken over where the estate left off and an suv does work quite well in the right circumstances people that high ups you know position don't they there's a reason why you're selling a lot but if you don't want one of them this is perfect it's big enough to get all the family stuff in yep and i do the fact that it is relatively low yeah i'm sick of cars that you have to get a a step you have to step up into it don't you yeah yeah what a great day we've literally been complaining about summer aren't we for the last few months we just entered september and look at it and it it's it's not stopped raining no and i've just had had uh a look on my twitter feed goodwood revival apparently is throwing it down it's just a mud bath so no one's getting out of that car pack no so yeah thanks weather this is that's it now we're done that's it that's it yeah this is winter now this is it do you know what it is a very easy car to driving i know we say this quite often about evs but this one in particular i think most cars are these days but there's some just there's easy to drive for people who aren't bothered about cars and then there's easy to drive but it also gives you a bit of feedback yeah that does give you some feedback you know it's not numb but easy to drive at the same time so you've been driving this for most of the week yeah yeah decent amount of miles for work where perfect yeah if the fact it's in the state means when i have had to carry something in i've not have to mess about with trying to fit it into the boot oh yeah just put it straight in there the flaish bear as well make life you carry a big server in the back put it in in there yeah yeah incredibly easy to live with and that is enough for a lot of people isn't it it is yeah it's easy to drive easy to live with i the look of it there you go i'm just going to buy that one yeah if they did a coera bon estate would you go for that with this i think i go for the coa bon estate so it's the lack of estates that's making this appealing yeah the thing is i think you're going for this vehicle because you need the extra boot space but you don't want the extra platform so you don't want to go for an id4 it's a lot more money as well but you need or you want that extra boot space for family stuff push chairs or maybe just for work i think this will get missed out by a lot of people because they'll just want an suv yeah look at the suv it's it's a taller car it's probably got smaller boot the mgzs type the kero yeah uh yeah mockers of this world i just think this is more of a driver's car does it feel more grown up yes yeah maybe that's what we're struggling to find it it is a more grownup car yeah and maybe it's because we have that it's an older estate person's thing but i do feel i'm in a car that that i am familiar with i can't see a a young couple in their 20s with a kid buying this car i think it's more aimed for people our age in the late 30s and it's probably quite got another challenge for you what's that what food is this ooh you say that every time cuz it's quite difficult isn't it usually it is sometimes you just you know instantly but this this i don't know do you know what it is a potato can be cooked in many different ways can it and essentially that's what stellantis have got they've got a potato vox all cooked it one way pero cooked it another way and you got mash and chips and yeah yeah yeah i think this is just slightly this is the highest end potato the high end potato pom fruit yeah i know i've got it b that triple cup chips that's what this is and sea salt oh sea salt oh yeah nice decent solid so is this the antidote to an suv i think it is that's the title an antidote to the to the suv now i want to carry on talking about this i know desate for the toilet why is it the closer you get to home the more you need to go if other cars did estate versions cpra oh yeah it would then drop down the list so this is more of a i mean it's a good car and i the style i the comfort i small pond i yeah it is that that's partly the why it's so elevated up there uh but i do the way it drives um it does drive yeah i mean it it it does drive really well doesn't it we keep saying this but it's it's there's just something there isn't there you feel it's it's direct you feel a bit of a connection between communicative yeah i think that's a good word for me they've just done what vox all either couldn't be bothered to do or were told not to do cool yeah the fact that there's such a a two three grand price difference i think is very deliberate again not in listing real terms because if this was the same price as yra it would be no contest oh no yeah none at all so yeah well um the one thing that isn't cheaper but is better in all way of course i think i know the membership membership 99 p you can't go wrong with can you especially for the free members only videos so i' started a uh amateur arop group i've joined one friday it's open mic night that's the worst joke right then i think we got enough yeah i'll be there shove that back seat if you want whoa whoa happ there i don't know chat kill you did did he try and decapitate i mean ah it's french guillotine guillotine it's a french guillotine i that's the pocket no it's in my back pocket how that just looks ranchy now is this worth instagram for",4
Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK1K85QpQ4hgvwkrBZlis8MD,YlINeaP3F3g,"i've just bought this used tesla model s and i genuinely think that this is the best value model s that you can buy on the used market today obviously that changes from week to week month to month but right now this for me was an absolute steel i was looking for a used model s one with high miles this has done a 186,000 miles which is what i was after for content for the in part to prove that evs that can't do more than 100,000 miles clearly can but then after a few months of searching this came up and i think again pound for pound after i've shown you around it and told you why it's such good value this for me is well it's it's the best content car i think i've bought in terms of what i'm getting and for what i paid it's a bit of a shed i'll be honest in terms of cosmetically i mean sounds sandpaper but to be fair to the company that sold it cuz this was a company care i told them not to touch it then i can restore it back to its former glory using my ex-professional detailer skills i wanted a content car and this gives me lots of that but in terms of what i'm getting for what i've paid again this is is well it's got some significant things that elevated it above the other stuff that i found the first being it was a company car going up and down the motorway as opposed to a taxi which usually high mile top tesla model s's are usually taxis lots of people getting in and out lots of stop start journeys this has just sat done 186,000 miles on a motorway with essentially one person probably in the driver's seat but the biggest thing that makes this immense value is is it's a 2018 tesla model s now this used to be i believe in the first 6 months of its life a tesla demo then the company bought it so it's essentially one owner from new after tesla anyway and the warranty expiration on the battery and the drivetrain cuz this is something that's unique with the model s it's infinite miles this has got just over 2 years left 29 for september 2026 and because of the infinite mile warranty that model s is come with at least up to i think 2020 it's covered the battery is still covered i could double the mileage on this i could quadruple the mileage on it and it's still covered under warranty the motors and the battery it's a 75d so that's the entry level fine for me still does 200 miles it's still on the original battery still on the original motor in fact mechanically i can't find anything wrong with it although there is is a few things which i'll show you in a second there's a sticker here from g technic crystal serum looks it had the ceramic coating a few years ago which is clearly gone by now but that's another added benefit and it's been looked after although i'm not sure if it's been washed often it's had a few tweaks which i'll again show you in a second the handles and and these in fact the passenger door handle got fixed last year i believe that's a common modeless problem and i think there's another common problem i'll show you again in a minute so the stuff i need to do don't get me wrong but it's the warranty that changes this completely right well let's start at the front and the uh well there's a good reason why on the car i've named it a certain name i'll show you that when i get inside though but yeah it it's uh it's filthy uh there's bits of well wax i think that's not scratch again that's wax so the potential of this is fantastic in terms of uh what i can get it i mean it's going to have a lot of stone chips i mean they're probably dotted all over a lot of this is dirt i should point out and you won't be able to pick it out so not all these white dots aren't stone chips they're a lot of stone chips but i can with a machine polish or something i can get most of those out something which i believe is quite a common issue again as you can just see it there the wipers are starting to eat the top of the bonnet which so so the wiper linkages need replacing let me know though if that's something that i can do myself do you think i should attempt it on this i am not a mechanic now when it comes to the bonnet can that actually be fixed or does it have to be replaced can a body shop do something with that the wheels well they've got i guess they used to have some sort of protector on or the sort of still do i don't know some much kind of piling off uh peeling off rather there's a bit of curbing going on but they don't look to be in bad condition oh no actually okay there's a bit there um so yeah i i don't know would you refurb again wheels on a car this old there is a a a ding it's almost golf ball ding you can probably just about see it there there's not really any paint damage it's tiny tiny amount so do you reckon someone can get that out again is it worth it let me know and you may have spotted already that the handles and all the chrome bits have been wrapped in black so you can just sort of see it there as it started to kind of ruffle up or something hello look even though at least the windows are clean and shiny panoramic sunroof works a treat it opens that's mechanically sound as a pound is this thing and yeah the rear wheel again is taking a bit of a battering so if i'm going to do something with the wheels it's all of them we've got oh no that's dirt i thought it was a scratch b again there's bount to be stuff but i reckon some of it i can buff out of these um the lights work fine and check out my carbon spoiler in it um which again it's just mck so i reckon that will come up really really nicely and you've got the black test tes logo now this is something i do know doesn't work properly this thing doesn't open automatically you kind of have to do it yourself the uh locking pin so you can charge it no problems i've supercharged it i've charged it at home myself that that works fine but it doesn't close by itself you kind of have to do it so again is this something that is home fixable or take it somewhere let me know how that's done or any howto videos that' be pretty good they wrap this of course so that's normally silver you can just about see where it's kind of peeling off a little bit there but you won't see it once this is out is that normal is it normally a screw in here is that is that a tesla thing and i have to say one thing i always look at when it comes to buying a used car the tires that someone puts on these are michelins pilot spot 3es all around so that that's good because if you watch the you'll know i always use meling tires and i'll be putting some new ones on cuz these are barely legal um so yeah the fact they put michelin ties on rather than some random cheap brand that again is another added benefit into the to the value of this it shows a level of of intent when looking after a car now the one thing i'd to ask you guys again i'm guessing there's not normally a hole in the uh the inside of this arch the arch liner uh i don't what's that do i don't know if you can see it there what what what's this let me now show you the boot and look you have a key if you double press that it opens the front double press that opens the car double press that opens the boot uh so now you're going to see the work ahead i have ahead of me um give me a second let's try that again beautiful yeah um so if i just lift that up you can see it's been well well used should we say i think that's the floor for under here and so yeah we've got the charger got the charger here that's all good and at least they put a really what looks quite an expensive boot liner in so i reckon that's i haven taking out i should point out this is quite early on in my ownership once i've removed this i reckon it might be a decent stair to boot ap from a couple little bits but again i can i reckon i can sort that out i just realized i've not actually checked the frunk in the entire time i've had this but look i've got the charge cable i've got the usual stuff so it's it's got all the original stuff with it so far so good check the inside for you them handles working perfectly at least for now here we go right here we go so you can see it says charge pot open it's not you can see i closed it i haven't gone through this at all cuz i've only i literally bought this two days ago and i've just been at work so let's have a look at where is it service right so i need some wind sk washer charge port door sensor so you can see here we've got the 2.5 computer uh um software is up to date all all good really you can see the mileage 185,000 again 306 wow look at that 180,000 miles nearly 60,000 kilow hours so 330 wat hours per mile that's probably got to be one of the longest still remembered uh how efficient is this car sort of things and bear in mind it's spent the majority of time on a motorway so not not around towns or anything that and probably if it's a sales guy or something to that affect it it's not been doing uh well let's say it's probably been doing audi speeds i guess but i might be wrong might be wrong glove box yeah no problems there now again again i haven't properly looked around this car so i haven't taken it apart so to speak but so far it seems to be oh hello what's this someone's got hair fever oh imodium hey that still works and we've got a bit of stuff here oh is that wax charge pad hey is that standard on the 2018 model list it's plugged in there let me know we have a parking ticket for derby and look at this how many cars do you buy that come with their own sweet corner refreshments peppermint sugarfree he again the value of this is off the charts ooh we got more stuff here b andq what's people been buying from bq rudolph rope legs gonky play pals design flat paint brush color sample santa stenciled mats let's test this let's put it all the way back there we go perfect so yeah so that works fine and again the passenger seat looks in phenomenal condition for what is again look at that really high miles car you see there the ccs adapter so it comes with that as well and i don't think the back seats have been used much certainly not a taxi or something that 18,000 miles would suggest there's the mileage 185,000 and you can see what i've named it because at the moment it is uh and i think that'll stick again need a clean but even the door cards are in really good condition can't complain at that and it's got really good stereo as well it's got the is it the premium interior package or something that's the driver's seat i mean this does not look it's warm does it again apart from a bit of dirt i expected the to be a lot here it's maybe a fraction there other than that this has held up really really really well i have to say you know i guess people go on about tesla build quality but you know let me know in the comments if you got any preferred uh mats that you go for so you can see why i this so much once it's cleaned up no one will know what my legits done there's no real telltale signs apart from a couple of little things that you you would't really spot unless someone pointed it out i've obviously got to get some tires replaced that's the first thing so some i don't know what do you say pilot spot 3es fours fives cross climates perhaps if we're going into winter some winter tires or stick with the michelin e primacy ones cuz then i'll get an extra kind of three four% out of it which is more than it think that's an extra what 8 n miles the wheels again refurb on referb aftermarket stick with tesla i don't want to go any bigger cuz i'd rather have comfort and efficiency over that over looks cu again is a 75d so is it worth making it look fast which leads me to option number two would you get a a a body kit on this or something would you you know i won say upgrade it would you modify it a little bit cosmetically i mean even the 75d has is it something 450 60 brake horsepower 4.2 to 60 that's that's quick for a sports car let alone a car of this size and all the seats and space it's got it's big boot frunk and it should be just as cheap to run as that thing there the model 3 because it seems to be not quite as efficient as the standard range i've got but not that far behind or option three just keep it as a shed keep it as the sbox its name and just leave it as that you know sort the tires and clean the inside out cuz that's where i'm sat but so just leave it this and it's a complete and total workhorse it's also uh something i'm less sure about because again i've never had a model s this uncared thing which i think you can do with the 75d so this is a 2018 model can i uncock this do do tesla do that do they still do that does it cost there's nothing in the app that says do you want to uncock this or increased performance so come on tesla guys you you'll be a to tell me in a heartbeat won't you so you know what what should i do with that if it's possible what the downsides to uncorking it what performance increase does it give me how much did i pay well let me put up now the cheapest 2018 model s that's currently on autot trader i bought this off auto trader i don't trust facebook there's too many fake clearly dodgy adverts out there so let's i'm i ignore that ebay maybe so again this is the cheapest just to give you some idea before i tell you how much i paid 20 2018 model s it's done i think 118,000 m and it's just under £17,000 the next one is a bit more expensive than that that's done 106,000 mi the cheapest has a warranty of 2 years left october 2026 this is end of september 2026 so it's pretty much the same as far as warranty is concerned on the battery and the drivetrain which is again the key thing that i keep mentioning so based on that and the fact that this has done well 60 70,000 mi more how much you reckon i paid for this model s75d with 186,000 mi on it 115,000 11 and a half now no doubt someone's about to say well i can get cheap one on facebook brilliant maybe you can but it's the warranty again that for me sets it apart from other ones for what i can turn this into i reckon i can get minal money back maybe even better because whatever content car i get i then have to typically anyway sell it in several months time once i've finished with the content and then i buy something else that's the whole point of a content car we won't be keeping this because well it's too big the model 3 is just as big as she's happy to go so we're not going to end up with this i won't get away with that one so however long i keep it i don't know i definitely want to get it above 200,000 mil which shouldn't take that long so it's probably going to be four or five months at least get it through the winter perhaps speaking of which if you're buying a brand new tesla there's now a referral scheme that they've reopened for tesla so if you want to buy a brand new model y model 3 in the uk then uh you get £1,000 off if you use my referral link which is in the description below i get £500 towards either a car which a new car anyway which i'm not going to do or service costs thanks to three very generous people that have already used it i've got £1,500 coming at some point in the future for tesla repairs for this the suspension oh wrong with it just sort out tesla the charge part i could probably get them to do it but i might try it myself cuz that i think that might be interesting so i'm in a very fortunate position there that that's kind of unique because of the i have but if you want to uh uh use a referral by all means as soon as i get up to the maximum limit of 10 i'll be changing that referral to somebody else's just to make it fair to to pass it on so to speak that's as you want to get to 10 of course but i might as well take advantage of the i have and that can mean that this is just going to be sorted the wheels what should i do with that should i leave the wrap on should i put a body kit on in fact speaking of body kits who does a body kit for teslas i don't know i've never looked for one who does a nice one should should i even think about that would that put off any potential buyer i mean let's face it if you're buying a car with 200,000 mi on it even if it's got 18 months war y left on the the main components it's probably only going to be a taxi driver that's going to buy one is there there might be someone out there i don't know maybe that this would appeal to because at that price point it's ,000 more than the c at me which is normally part there for this i've got a model s for ,000 more than that was look out for videos in the near future the first one being is the resurrection of the sbox the shed the full clean the full detail probably four or five days worth condensed into a short that's the first thing then there's the repairs and anything wrong with it i'm probably going to take it to a third part to see what's wrong with it and then maybe use the referrals to pay for the fixes so tesla can fix it is there anything worn suspension wise is the what's the battery things that that's another thing to look for another content that i can get from it which is again this is why youtubers buy cars it's not just cuz they want who own them i mean to put a private regge on that no one would know would that what this has done um so anyway there's lots to think about and hopefully lots to watch in the near future so do to the because without that i wouldn't have this to play with genuinely so we've recently passed 880,000 subscribers thank you very much for that and uh members members get these videos on sunday instead of friday and there's some unique members only videos as well that will always remain as members only videos so if that is something that appeals to you by all means 9 9

suited to this area the inverters again better suited to the fact that we're in yorkshire and the sun does shine for one week of the year so effectively he spent more but he should generate more so i'm i'm better at the starting point but ultimately it's going to tip over at least that's what we think so we've got some preliminary data in terms of his generation my generation a heat pump it's designed for the house and to a lesser extent so should these in theory so that's what we're going to look at anyway to see if spending more saves you more right as i said we've got some data for the last few months so it's just kind of a first look um we've got a lot of people asking us about this at fully charged live shows as well as online so we thought we' do a bit of a catchup sooner rather than later and uh this is not scientific of course but given our houses both east west similar location we're just a few miles apart same elevation it's close enough to kind of point us in the direction of whether or not it is worth that extra so let's go inside and see if it's the case right so i want to be very clear here that again this is not sci ific and ultimately it is a sponsored by heatable who you got your solar panels from as an actual customer so that's before any his sponsor started but heatable are sponsoring this and big thank you to them because they installed sol panels whil my brother was ill and that's the whole reason of doing this sponsorship that we're doing with them so again to be very clear they are not controlling the content the data is the data we're saying what it is we're not going to make it look good or anything that so hopefully it looks good yeah because if you don't have you know expected better generation or predicted generation then obviously we are going to tell you that um they're also doing fixed battery installs and if you wanted something a i don't know a give energy all in one and not i'm not biased in that at all working for them uh but that's the battery you got that's the battery about six months before i joined give en fixed price here you go i think it's just £7,000 and they do not send finance as well so yeah exactly have a look at heatable and as a actual customer you're happy ab really happy yeah so there you go so that's the best we could do thank you to them for sponsoring the let's get on with this and see if this premium install let's have a look at the out yes because we have been kind of keeping up with each other aren't we but ultimately trying to hold a bit it's a bit top chumps is it each day we just go what did you do what did you do yes mine does better when it's very sunny yeah yours does better in lower light so that's essentially part of the design uh that we've been talking about and what heatable specifically said now when it comes to the actual rea panels if you want to know more details about them watch the previous i'll put a link to that in the description where i actually talk to heatable about the panels in in more detail as you b facial all that stuff and why they're meant to be better i've got a better top end as i said you've got a better um lower end i i've got a vtec honda engine and you've got turbo diesel yeah you've got a sprinter i've got a marathan runner you live in yorkshire you know you're not going to get bright sunshine enough to justify much all no so we're basing the panels and the inverters on part that the inverters as well yeah the inverters are a big part of this uh but we're basing that on the fact that you've got an east west facing house in yorkshire it's sunny for about a week of the year they're saying we've tailored this to the worst month yeah uh worst weather or not the worst weather the po weather which we usually get when i looked at it i'm going but because they have put smaller inverters on there to make it more efficient i'm going i'm not getting the maximum out of panels yes they're going oh just just hold on you will get the maximum out of panels in your scenario yes so it's it's the year round average isn't it yeah so the what the panels 430 watt i think yeah think 30 and the inver is are 350 watt i think so um so ultimately in bright bright sunshine yeah you won't get above what those inverters can do so the panels can do more 2.8 i'm getting so it's having a buffer in an engine in it's it's rev limit yeah yeah yeah so therefore the idea behind that is is that these inverters can activate as they call it a lot less wattage lower yeah voltage wattage whatever so in seven eight months of the year they're going to activate a lot sooner than mine yeah mine which will give me that bit enough load to cover the base so again it's it's it's the marathon isn't it looking at it not just the peaking summer which most people concentrate on um so that's kind of the system design we're talking about but and i guess it's going to be different if you live down south on the south coast you're probably going to want the big r iners my brother big r in ver yeah part of this sponsor has got the same panels as you i think it's slightly higher rated uh but he's down south yeah yeah with a south facing roof so they design the best of everything yeah yeah so they designed his system for for for peak sunshine so he's going to get it far more than lower sunshine it's not just you pick it off a shelf and stick it in which is what i did so i got a cheaper install and there's nothing wrong with that per se but i i think if i could go back in time i did with a heat pump it's all about the design it i guess it's a bit getting a heat pump without getting a heat engineer to come around to design it first yeah say we'll get this one we'll stick that in there you go you're on your way you might look out but effectively if you look at a fixed price solar install good value yeah but it's the same for not north south facing west facing east facing down south up north it's the same station everywhere and yet if you tailor it to the environment more and the house logically you should get a little bit here a little bit there a little bit there it's probably first pointing out that i've got the uh i think they're called p type panels you've got topc n type panels so the degradation over 25 so this is 25 years warranty i think so the lifespan is beyond that so over 25 years the drop off is very minimal mine will degrade i think 10 to 20% more than yours yeah so this is again this is something we can't possibly see here now but in 20 years time watch this space yeah watch the space but ultimately yeah so that that's got to be facted in as well you should be generating more in five years time 10 years time than than i will be by that point so there's a lot to factor in but it's all about again we're not saying that the the better panels are going to gener generate more of course they are more expensive panels are going to do that it's the designer behind it that costs more money anything yeah yeah you get someone to design you a a computer network as opposed to just buying it from amazon yeah it's going to be running better we've got pretty much three full months worth of data or at least the same sort of time i have 4.48 kilow of theoretical maximum generation okay 4.48 you've got 344 3.44 kilow so therefore i have got 26% i think it is bigger array yeah so i should generate more let forget the inverters yeah as as an arr size inverters are clipping or anything so that's purely panels as we said your inverters are actually lowering that to 2.8 2.8 so in theory you can only max out 2.8 odd kilowatt and i can go to 4.4 all right okay if everything was running if everything was running so my point is i should be higher a lot across the board so the best day generation on the dollar months yeah yeah again we're picking the worst time of year for this aren't we with sunnier days uh what was 30th of march and i generated 13.15 kilow kilow hours on that same day i did 16.0 16.01 so 16 so you got so that's 20% more i i did yeah yeah yeah and and i've got a 25% bigger array so my best day was a 25 and i got 16.13 12.58 yeah i mean it's worth saying as well that for the entire so i i had the last week in march i had dr on and i generated a1 kilowatt hours in the entirety of march i generated 191 kilow so for one week i did half roughly half of what you've done over half what you've done i did in the entire month 64.91 on the 9th and 10th of march yours should be well it's what you said off camera if if if on those days days if i got if you got a kilowatt and i get two i've doubled yeah for those days but i've got the bigger array yeah right so the most i've generated in the month of june was 21.6 kilowatt hours and that was on the 22nd of june so 22nd 21. 38 so it's basically the same same and this is what we're talking about in terms of i mean i mean i i should be 20 ahead did i think in that day is if the day is there you've generated in that section there maximum where i've generated less across more of the day and remember we're based on that 26% bigger r that you've got on your panels go what the inverters are capping out 2 i've probably 30 odd per bigger a r on some of these days i'm i'm outpacing your your and i should be because i got much bigger a but mine are performing better because i can take advantage of the uh direct sunlight the really strong sun but even then yeah i'm basically doing a little bit better when i should be higher uh so what's the total for june for yours so far total for june is 390 391 give or take and i've got 440 give or take kilowatt hours yeah so i've i'm generating 10% more on the sunnier days you are even though my rare again is 20% bigger so during summer this is the worst time time for for you to to to to see if it's worked once we 12 months that's that's the ultimate goal for this is it that we can see the full year and over that 12 months if you're factoring the difference in sizes i think you will be generating possibly more than me even though my is much bigger i think i think overall yeah so so so far and again it's not scientific is it but it does seem to make sense it's looking what's in the in the brochure is is performing as it should do especially when i've got full electric house the heat pump all that sort of stuff and i want more generation in the darker colder months yeah yeah yeah so mine is the is the is the old peak in it during the day during the afternoon i got a lot during summer i got a lot yours more of a gentle curve is yeah yeah throughout the year yeah so i'm really interested to get to the november december dates we will do obviously a followup for that but so far then i would say that it's it's valid yeah in terms of spending more i mean looking at you said there's days where especially this time of year where you are producing but you're not producing the numbers that you would expect in comparison not compared to the size of the array difference i mean think that's the thing that people need to really remember which is why i keep mentioning it at 2.88 kilowatts or whatever that that your inverter maximum is i've got a third bigger array at least and yet still quite barely beating you and on some days you're beating me so the micro inverters you've got are clearly having a good effect in the uh when the when the sun starts to come out on the days i mean it's great today as well i would probably go back in time if i could and change and spend my money yeah it never occurred to me you just think that solar panels are solar panels i get a solar panel there you go off the shelf it does this but you don't necessarily think of the other bits and pieces well no the inverter together yeah i mean micro inverters uh hybrid inverter ac coupled inverter now i've done now i'm doing the job i'm doing i'm much more into this sort of thing and there are efficiency losses with this and that so this is where i guess the the designer is important it's so obvious to me now buying to go and buy if you you know if you you buying an ev and you want an efficient one you got people think a lot of people just think an ev is an ev and just go out and buy one and then they get a pul star to and they're wondering why it's quite exp well i'm not saving that much money over having a petrol car well are you on the right tariff tariff yeah yeah well yeah there's other other components yeah it's just making sure that if you do it all that you're on you know the right tariff and the uh you get the right thing sed for you it's especially as this is some again that's worth watching the previous for when he's me uh heatable was mentioning the difference in prices he said the panels are really cheap right now so i think he said it was about 50 60 pound more per panel which is for yours over my new the new version of my equivalent the budget panels it's the scaffolding and the labor that's expensive so you might as well spend that little bit extra on the panels you're going to pay extra for the system designer i would expect that um so but it's a complet it's it's the whole package isn't it yeah so how much more then did you spend on yours compared to an off the shelf we'll call it solar fixed price sort of thing it wasn't a massive amount i mean with what i got anywhere between a grand to a grand and a half three i reckon three or 400 quid a year if i had yeah yeah yeah a better designer ratio he put so that's what four five years it's it's going to break even and after that i've got 20 years of of saving more yeah and that's that don't read into that too much cuz that's that's just off kind of top of the that's my math but i i i genuinely would go back in time and go for a better design system more expensive panels maybe different inverters perhaps yeah you look online when you get your car insurance you get the cheapest no cheapest isn't best i didn't do that this time i got car insurance i didn't go for the cheapest i went for the one that was three or far down because it had i could ring somebody up if i wanted to i didn't have to do it just online you want service exactly if you get i mean i've had a claim before yeah uh and it went through no problems at all where if i'd have gone with a cheap insurance maybe i'd have had a lot of battling to to pay out for what was a stolen car again to use the car analogy it's saying well give me another, 1500 quids sir and i'll turn that 50 m gallon car into a 60 m gallon car yeah i do a lot of miles so that's going to save me a lot of money and it's going to be you know your your the degradation remember we're basing this on brand new stuff yeah if we did this in 10 years time 15 years time you'd be even further ahead well you would be yeah you know what it's jeans yeah yeah i i used to replace my jeans every two or three years because i just bought the cheapest crap i could find yeah yeah ever since i went to levis and i was a youtuber if they want to do a uh sponsorship sponsorship but it is in it it's buy it shite buy it twice yeah yeah yeah these will last me for years will so even though they're more expensive ultimately it's a better value cost per day cost per day once we get into the winter i can't wait to see well i don't want to in some respect but i mean you had a lot of people asking you didn't you fully charged life the north i think that was the only thing i talk to people about and there's a there's a a lovely guy who i keep meeting at of school right he's interested in coming up and having a look and you've had neighbors as well about s ps yeah yeah so basically he doing very well at you you you're not even sponsored i am what's the best value not the cheapest value and why i didn't do it for solar i don't know um i guess maybe you just think i can afford that i'll get it now yeah yeah there's a bit of that i could get one today yeah when you're going online looking at stuff sometimes it puts me off if i have to ring them up or i have to talk it's i don't want a some sales ring me up somebody up tur to put my house tring to sell me double glazing and then but but i guess what we saying is you have to yeah because no one's going to come up and say this is the best for your house without at least having the details of without knowing you know everything even physically visiting it and there's nothing wrong with budget stuff no no i'm happy with my array i just have a bit of array envy yeah wait a minute yours is smaller and does more it's not it's not the size we got the innuendos in there do more research ultimately heat. co.uk they've got an online tool them and yeah whoever you use just again three quotes and say that ev man told me yeah drop drop the name cuz then you look good look good uh but ultim yeah thanks for listening thanks for watching this thanks for becoming a member of the for 99p that's the best value of all is especially as now actual members only videos are going up one two three times a week on top of the normal these are never going to go on the normal so you actually getting something for no no surprisingly can get away with more when you so no it it helps the out and i appreciate that and uh thanks for watching so yeah cheers thanks guys bye",3
Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK3qIOtZKVv68oiQbgtv6AVK,r8e6uA_XsxU,"hi guys i'm evm and welcome back now today i want to talk about batteries in electric cars because there's a huge monumental amount of misinformation disinformation half truth and bold-faced lies out there then make it very difficult for anybody wanting to buy an eevee with any confidence in this i hope to dispel those myths so you can actually buy an eevee without worrying about the stuff that well let's face it things the daily mail constantly bang on about which isn't just bending the truth it's completely wrong one example of this is the nearly daily comment i get from people saying that you need to replace the batteries every two or three years i mean let's face it sometimes talking to these people who hear electric cows for reasons i can't fathom even though they've never even sat in one let alone form one it's it's talking to a flat earther and trying to persuade them that the earth isn't actually flat anyway that's what this is about to try and point people in the right direction when these questions and comments come along so if you're thinking about buying an eevee and you're worried about the batteries then well don't and hopefully this will alais some of those fears right let's that with what's actually inside a battery electric calf because again there's several things which i think people are unaware of the first thing is that there isn't just a battery in a battery electric calf if you're thinking it's something this which is an iphone battery but a bigger version of it it's not at all there are many many batteries in an electric car for example my leaf outside that's a 32-hour leaf which is from nearly four years old now that has 192 cells in it so it's not just one big battery it many batteries which has significant advantages which i'll kind of come to throughout this another thing that's worth pointing out is that they are much more advanced than what people traditionally think of as batteries so this for example is not the same as what you would get in an electric vehicle they are far more advanced another thing that electric vehicles have over typical consumer items anywhere is a battery management system now this as it sounds but bms is it's job is just to look up the batteries i'm not sure how much more clearly it can be i will give you one example of this rather than all the examples of why actually does but this kind of gives you an idea of what the bms does and why it's a good thing for battery longevity now we all pretty much know about completely depleting a battery it doesn't do it any favors they don't to be completely rundown on the flip side they don't want to be fully charged or 100% either it can reduce their lifespan so what a battery management system will do is stop that from happening let's again take my leaf outside as an example nissan are a little bit naughty on this one because they advertise it as a 30 kilowatt hour leaf in reality though it's about 27 and a half kilo hour of a usable of battery and that's because they reserved kind of a buffer at the top of the battery and a buffer at the bottom of the battery to stop it being fully charged completely to stop it being fully depleted so for example if i drive my leaf till it stops literally so it's a zero percent a stops working and the car says you're on zero percent in reality that battery is actually about four five percent that's done just to protect the battery from completely depleting itself or back shoulda say and in it protects it basically he aids its longevity and on the flip side if i charge that up to full 100% the batch is not actually at 100% is probably in ninety five ninety six percent now some cars are bigger buffers of another but ultimately that's just one example of many things that rbms a battery management system does to to protect them so they'll last longer than things this something else that they have which again adds longevity and protects them but not all v's have this is a thermal battery management now mike lee for example has not active thermal batch management whatsoever all the cars tesla's for example that most people are familiar with they have full thermal battery management again most people recognize that when a battery gets very very cold it reduces it reduces its efficiency and can reduce its lifespan as well and on the flip side if it gets too hot it will again reduce efficiency and lifespan what the thermal battery management will do is if the battery pack gets too hot it cools it down and of course if it gets too cold it will heat it up so it maintains a stable temperature range again to aid in the lifespan of the battery as i said not all v's have that thundra stuff back sure cooling to stop they're getting too hot all those have the full thing and some my leaf don't have any active thermal battery management at all now collectively what i'm saying is once you factor in you've got much more advanced batteries you've got lots of them not just warned you've got battery management systems and somehow thermal battery management systems what i'm saying you don't impose your experience of these things or even these things iphone batteries are form batteries in general and think that's what it's in an electric vehicle ignore these completely what you think you know about batteries in normal day-to-day life isn't what you will experience in an electric car so that's something hopefully we've cleared up now they are a different animal our batteries in an eevee compared to laptops phones cameras that's our stuff now let's get on to a question which is again very commonly asked how long do batteries last in electric cat but ultimately it's one that is almost impossible to accurately answer there are a gazillion of variables which affect the lifespan of anything not just batteries and you'd need more information to give someone an even vaguely accurate answer to that question put it this way if i asked you how long does a petrol engine last typically the answer would be well which petrol engine and we're talking about a dutch asunder or engine here or a mercedes e-class engine are we talking about cow that serviced properly i wonder if abused and never serviced at all does it give lots of short journeys lots of long journeys is it driven real harshly is it driven carefully there's a gazillion variables that affect the lifespan of an engine and a battery carries no different you get my point it's it's a very broad question that could only be very broadly answered but i am going to attempt it now what i'm gonna try and do is give you two examples of qasr so right now today in 2021 at the lower end of the battery technology scale and one of the top end so if we can see the worst case scenario and the best case scenario then it'll give us an idea of where we're going so for this i'm gonna pick a nissan leaf under tesla model s just because they've both been out for quite a long time the leaf has a less advanced system should we say a battery management nor thermal battery management at all in terms of active anyway where is the tesla that's pretty much regarded as the pinnacle of battery technology right now how they look after their batteries so that that's the stein place let's look at what you will get roughly out of a leaf and a model s now just quickly to answer the question you need to replace your batteries every two or three years i can debunk that immediately because well let's take the nissan leaf my nissan leaf for example it's 2016 30 kilowatt hour and that comes on the battery with a eight gear hundred thousand mile warranty now i know that manufacturers aren't stupid when it comes to money and they're not going to warranty something that needs your place in two or three times during that warranty period which will ultimately end up costing them a fortune would they do that of course they wouldn't now let me be clear i've just said you'll get a seven or eight year warranty on all cows sold right now in the uk today depending on the manufacturer swimmer seven somewhere eight years but that doesn't mean you need to replace the batteries after seven or eight years this is another thing people i don't know they don't listen to what you say just you wouldn't replace a petrol engine when it's warranty ended you don't replace the batteries in an eevee when we when it warranty ends in terms of the leaf misun guarantee and minimum state of health of 70% after that period of eight years or a hundred thousand miles now listen look at my lips minimum now again nissan aren't going to want to take chances on this and end up paying money out with it or nita so if they think it's going to be a minimum of 70% after that period in reality it will be at least 75% minimum now if we look at 75% as a minimum i would say that the top end of that scale would be about 85% after that period so about 85 percent to 75 percent which gives us a rough average of about 80 percent state of health on average furnace on leaves over eight years or a hundred thousand miles of course that's what they call an average so will be higher some will be lower now let me just pause for a second and leave the nissan leaf that what we just said i will look at what happens post 100,000 miles eight years in a minute but now i want to look at the tesla model s and see what sort of battery year state of health would get after a similar period now given its to three times as expensive as a nissan leaf you would expect a much better state of health tesla's again are kind of known for their longevity and looking after their batteries very well and thankfully because they have been out a long time there's an awful lot of data out there now to stop me having to make my own graphs and all sorts of stuff i'm taking this from a variety of sources this comes from the very good website electric so this for example is actual data of tesla's model s's and x's over 250,000 kilometers as you can see from this graph the red line is the average of them all and all the dots of the individual cars and what this basically tells us is that after 205 2,000 kilometers you still got about 92 percent on average battery health battery degradation less than 10 percent after over a hundred and sixty thousand miles console this theater batteries are only gonna get better and better with age now this other graph here again it shows 250 thousand kilometers and up the side you can see the battery going from 85 to 100 percent health and you see there's that there's a bit of a drop off at the beginning and then it kind of plateaus out but over 100 and was it 60,000 miles i think it was you've still got well over 90 percent battery health so even if we don't it down and said you only get 90 percent after that period you can see there's a clear difference between a tesla and a nissan leaf i guess what you take from this is you get what you pay for but after 100,000 miles and this on leaf is at about 80 maybe 82 percent in reality and being a bit harsh in these figures whereas a tesla and model s or an x this thing you'll be probably at nineteen ninety two percent so clearly it has much more advanced systems and that affects the lifespan which is again why it's such a difficult question to answer the first thing that you'd need to know against is what car are we talking about here this graph from a very very good website called geotab they have a great blog which gives you lots of details in and reports about 6,000 electric vehicles of very mix and models unless they of health and things so it's a great place to get information for videos this now you see and they were graphing back to show you this is the battery degradation of 2015 leaf versus a 2015 tesla model s you can see a clear difference there the staff at one percent and the leaf tails off a faster rate than the tesla obviously that's less than five years old because it's a 2015 karen ronnie in 2020 this is why again is very difficult to answer that this question because cars aren't really been out long enough to give us a definitive answer and that leads us to another thing which is different with v's compared to a petrol engine car typically it with a petrol engine although it does lose efficiency you will end up with a working car working car working care and then he just stops working there'll be a component failure which means that engine just topsy's dead or it's only economical to repair that's what typically happens obviously some people repair them some people could do it themselves they're the exceptions but generally speaking it gets to a point with an old car we've all had it where something goes and you think it's not worth repairing so there's a definitive end point with a petrol engine car there or you can say it will last roughly this long before a major component failure within evey concerning the batteries then that's a little bit more difficult because you don't get kind of a working curve and then it just stops you get just degradation degradation degradation degradation degradation of course mortars and things can confirm our batteries now so i guess it's a case of how are you class where the end point is where it stops being usable let's take somebody that needs 100 miles and range for their life they say 100 miles is modern not for me and they end up getting a car with the 200 mile range they could have 50 percent battery degradation before it affects their life before it becomes unusable the person with the 200 mile range car that's now only got 100 mile range because of the 50 percent degradation wouldn't just get rid of it they would sell it to someone that oh yeah hold your mouth is more than enough for me i only need 50 miles so you get my point it's very difficult to determine where an eevee stops being usable or useful because what might be unusable to you or me might be useful for someone else obviously because they don't being out nothing it's very difficult to say they split if someone put a gun to my head and say i want you to give me a long-term projection for a leaf the one you've done in this and the model s how long are they gonna last well i would probably predict a 2015 leaf in this circumstance erican you would hit that sixty percent degradation point about 175 to 200 thousand miles that's that's my guesstimate time will tell in terms of age because obviously some people do more miles than others then i reckon between ten and twelve years before the leaf hits that point you can't predict the future and that's quite difficult but given the eighty percent likely after 100,000 miles or eight years i would say that that's about right for me for something a nissan leaf so 175 to 200 thousand miles again on average someone way more than that some will be less than that i think i'm gonna go with that one and the same for the years 10 to 12 years now when we look at the tesla model s well there's there's a million examples of hi mine was out there for you i could have picked tunes however what i would probably say with 100% certainty is that in terms of batteries alone a tesla's battery will outlast the cat considerably there's tons of people with hundreds of thousands of miles on there i think they're gang with the highest mileage tesla the one has got 550 thousand miles on it and that's on the original battery not sure about mortars but this is about batteries it's definite effect said that the batteries will never be a concern in something a tesla in a leaf depending on how old it is when you get it or how long you keep your cars potentially could be but i think hundred and seventy-five to two hundred thousand miles avocado isn't too bad and again it doesn't stop working he just means it's not got as much range but the last time i found what the average lifespan of a typical car petrol car was the rac said he was about 12 12 and a half years obviously some of those will last a year before they get smashed and told some of them will last 20 years and that's how you end up with an average and so i think what we can take from this is that if you buy a lower end priced electric vehicle it will clearly not last as long as a higher end electric vehicle you get what you pay for in life i suppose so that box out i'm just gonna leave them statistics out there and and leave it up to you whether you think that's acceptable or not now let's get on to what if you want to repair those batteries what if you think you know what it's got 6% degradation now i want to keep my car and just get the batteries back up to health this is something again people often get the amount of times people used to tell me with my old leaf 224 kilo our leaf which is a much smaller battery that it's going to cost me five thousand pounds to replace the batteries i wish i owned a penny for every time i got one of those comments anyway ultimately this is something that it will it is not true and it's for this reason let me give you another example let's say you've got an old car 15 you know volkswagen golf and the engines just gone you need a new engine what what happened is hello mister volkswagen yes my engines gone on my volkswagen golf gti it's 15 years old so could you try to move up a brand new engine a full retail price see that doesn't happen does it people do not replace an old engine that's gone in the real world with a brand new one from the dealer what typically happens and we've all of it is that you will look for a used engine or maybe a refurbished engine and get it back up and running that way i can't think of a single person although i'm sure there is one out there no doubt in the comments section that has bought a brand new engine from a main dealer because their engine is gone at least when it's well out of warranty it's an old car anyway and the same would be said from an electric vehicle for one you already know there's many batches not just one so you'd only replace the cells that needed replacing so if 40% of the cells had a fault you would replace 40% of the battery not the whole battery pack so nobody is going to have an old electric vehicle and then buy a full retail price battery pack from a dealer and replace the whole battery even or only half of it needs replacing what in reality will happen and happens now is that they will go to a third party or an independent battery specialist there are many sprouting up all over the country right now and they will take your old battery out and put a refurbished battery in its place at the whole battery pack i mean they will then probably refurbish your about your back and someone else will get that so in reality it doesn't happen people will not go any sun with a 15 year old nissan leaf and say here you go repair repair it for me charge me what you want let's face it someone at the daily mail who does this sort of article will ring up nissan say how much is a brand new battery even though in 15 years it'll be a lot cheaper how much is a new battery oh it's five thousand pounds for the eyes amore i'll put that in my article it doesn't make sense any more than finding a brand new golf gti engine would make sense insane that's what you have to spend after 10 to 15 years of owning a golf gti so you get what i'm saying here a replacement wouldn't be the whole battery it'll be just the path that needed it and you you wouldn't typically go to a main dealer not want to get to that edge anyway it should also be noted that looking at a 10 year old electric car today isn't indicative of what a car today will look in 10 years time battery technology is moving on i mean it's getting advanced year on year on year so a cat today will be mot will last longer and more advanced than the car from 10 years ago of course just a petrol engine gets more efficient the venue where they get in there the better they get designed the same can be said with electric vehicles so when we get to you know 15 20 years from now who knows where we'll be at if solid state batteries become a thing and lots of people out there think it will do there's even some manufacturers claiming they've cracked it already that will completely change everything but that's for another and so anyway hopefully this has explained a bit more about electric vehicle batteries in a non-technical sense of course at the end of day i am not a battery specialist i am not an engineer so so take everything with a pinch of salt on youtube do especially if it's in mainstream media as well but i've tried to back anything i've said up here with at least some evidence and i'm confident in the assumptions i made in here that they are correct now of course if i have got anything wrong i'm sure people have told me in the comments 14 million times already so i apologize for that but fingers crossed i haven't so yes as this lady off fears as it made you think oh actually yeah my my look into battery cars now i did think that on the last 2 or 3 years but now i'm no better as it made you just think well watch they know and i'm still not convinced let me know that's what the comments are for but just be polite that's all i ask i don't mind questions i don't mind opposing opinions and as long as he back eat up in somewhere just saying electric has a crap and unless i can drive 800 miles on a single charge i'm not interested that doesn't help anyone does it i mean i love that coming unless i can do 800 miles i'm not on i don't want one well is quite often people drive from land's end to john o'groats for a 15 18 hour drive without stopping at all that happens all the time isn't it right as always thank you for watching do it does help and if you want to buy some work go to lovely merch calm for / evn everything i'm in the description below thank you for watching and i'll see you soon",1
Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK3qIOtZKVv68oiQbgtv6AVK,jTepxmIjt-A,hello and welcome back to the i'm evm and this is a which hopefully will guide you through the process of getting one of these an electric car charger for one of these an electric car i did a about this about two or three years ago but things have changed a bit since then so i thought do an updated so if you are thinking about getting a car that needs one of them and you charge at home of course then uh keep watching because hopefully this at worst will waste 15 minutes of your time for things you already know or at best could save you a lot of hassle and potentially some money right well let's start at the beginning why would you get one of these instead of using one of these which every household already has a three-pin plug socket essentially it's for one of two reasons for me one safety these are designed but not designed to run at maximum capacity for many hours if there's even slightly bad wiring in that or just cheap components you may end up with a problem essentially i've seen too many pictures of these being black and chad misses and it's not ideal it should work and i do use mine occasionally when i've got a press car as well so i've got two evs to charge i'm not saying that you shouldn't use one at all just rely on one on one solely day in day out for many months charging many hours at a time they're not really designed for that whereas these are designed for it to use a terrible analogy and i should point out i am not a qualified electrician on this one but for me using this is having a car towing a caravan when it can only just pull it the engine is running at its limits but it can still tow the caravan whereas this tows the caravan with not no worries at all they'll both do the same job but this one will do it quicker and it won't be under any strain or pressure it won't be ruining the capacity whereas this will be so although you can use one of these and i do on a semi-regular basis certainly when i'm visiting someone who doesn't have a charger that's fine just make sure if you are using it everything is above board all the wiring is fine there's no heat issues it's all good how it should be but to make it simple i think just just get one of these but that's just one reason a second reason is of course speed this will charge at around seven kilowatts this will be just over two kilowatts so it's more than three times faster to use this than this now you might think well i've got what 12 hours every night why do i really need that extra speed for the cost of getting one installed it depends on the tariff you're on you see i'm on a time of day tariff it's cheaper at night than it is during the day i don't see them going anytime soon in fact for many many decades i think we'll have a time of day tariff remember they started in 1976 they're not going anywhere but anyway back to the point i have a time of day tariff and for four hours that's when this car gets charged because it's considerably cheaper than using the other 20 hours of the day so the quicker i can put it into my car the better can you survive with that yes but this makes things far far easier and the chances of anything going wrong a lot less as well now the one thing that has changed is the ores they've grant as i said earlier doesn't apply to people who own their own house so that typically means that for a lot it's gone up upwards of 350 pounds more than it was before the first of april which is when the grant changed another kind of effect of that though is that you don't have to because there is no grant anymore really for a lot of people you don't have to go with an ozef approved installer now that might think it should be cheaper i could use fred the electrician down the road if you're an electrician yourself you might be able to install it yourself because you don't have to worry about the grant therefore you don't have to go through the approved process now for me this is a bit of a double-edged sword for one you're not guaranteed to be cheaper by using a local electrician compared to a proper child point installer and two i think experience is worth it i'm sure any electrician watching this as an example would take somebody who's been an electrician for a few years over somebody who has basically just come straight out of college or university and has aced every exam experience means a lot and someone who installs these day in day out is going to know the little quirks of each make and model they're going to foresee the issues which they've come across day in day out installing these things whereas someone who does have the skills to install one an electrician for example may not know that just because they've never done one before or they're unfamiliar with that particular american model i have talked to nearly 20 people who have got a local electrician to install their charge point and although it's working fine it's perfectly safe i'm not saying that it wouldn't be they haven't done one key thing and that's notify their dno the distribution network operator i live in yorkshire mine is the northern power grid as an example and a quick google will find out who yours is but essentially before you get a charge point installed you're meant to notify your dnr to make sure it's okay that you get one 99 times out of 100 it'll be fine but you still have to tell them and that's something that i think local electricians or people that do it themselves are not doing now on that subject i would recommend the company that installed this for me long before any sponsorship on this started that is of course if you're familiar with the smart home charge they are nationwide installers they are also approved even if it's just a landlord it's still around but they are fully approved they've done this year in year out they have a ton of charges to choose from in fact if you go to smarthomecharge.com at uk you can put in the car you have of the car you're getting and then it will spew out a list of charges that work brilliantly with that car although to be fair most are type 2 we've had all cars sold now are type 2 so any charger should work with any car but you'll get a full list of that if you don't want to get them to install it that's fine they can sell you just the unit itself if you want or you can get them to do everything a fire and forget solution out of the box a button and they will then ask you for all the information they need to make it just a simple turn up on the day whack it in everything's good all the paperwork's done the dnr side of it everything is taken care of look at their trust pilot reviews if you don't believe just me again i use them before any sponsorship started so i'm happy to recommend them to you so now let's carry on with the process let me go back to the speed of these things which some people again get tripped up on i get a lot of questions as do smart home chargers who have obviously helped me out throughout this about i want the 22 kilowatt version of this because you can get 22 kilowatt versions of i'm not saying this particular charge point i'm on about charge points in general um because my car on the ac side of things will charge at up to 22 kilowatts so why not go for 22 which is surely better than seven it does make sense well it's not a case of you can't get the 22 version of whatever charge you're after it's a case of your house will not support the 22 kilowatt version of that charger in the uk for those that don't know single phase electricity is by far and away the most common um type of connection that we have in residential properties i don't know the percentage but i imagine it's in the high 90s of the amount of people have single phase as opposed to three phase electricity to their house so there's no point getting a 22 kilowatt charger when your house supply will only do seven if you don't know if you have three phase electricity to your house then i can pretty much almost guarantee you you don't because you would know if you did on the continent it's far more common so it does confuse things a little bit but ultimately in the uk just stick with a seven kilowatt charge point unless you absolutely know that you've got three phase electricity to your house and you do need 22. now you might be saying which charger to go for and yes before anybody mentions it the charge is in the car and that's not strictly a charger i don't care i'm calling it a charger okay which one to go for well as you can see i've got an army i'm not suggesting that you absolutely would go for this this for me was chosen because it had the features i wanted and it was at the cheapest price and that is essentially what i personally recommend anybody asking me to do so i thought all right i want these options i want these capabilities of my charger and then i'll just go for the cheapest one that's got a decent warranty at least there is one other thing which i would kind of add to that i suppose and it's getting less and less common but it is a thing some charge points will need an earth rod installing to them which is basically a massive long rod which gets driven into the ground and there's a cable from that rod to the charge point again that's less and less common it will more than likely increase your installation costs so for me personally i would just stick with a charge point that does not need an earth rod which again it's very common an earthing point is something which i think they're all kind of getting rid of i don't know the percentage i would say the majority now probably don't need that but to make it simple and the installation probably cheaper just go for one this that doesn't need it and then well again job done next we go to what is probably the most important thing that you need to think about when it comes to getting one installed before the installer turns up and for this i think i'm going to have to change cameras to something that's a bit a bit more of a wider angle where you position the charger is key especially if you change your car and suddenly find the charge point that was at the back is now at the front it can trip a lot of people up and does to the point where they have to move the charge point somewhere else at extra cost and that's what we're trying to avoid so have a good think about where it's going to go so for example ours went there so do a dad run for you when i had our nissan leaf which charged at the front it easily reached the car we have now charges here again easily reached if we don't reverse the car into this spot and we drove it in front ways it would again easily reach so we've planned this with some thought but what if we can't get the car in the garage at all and it needs to go on the driveway well for that i'm just going to have to open it up so what is a very cold outside even if the car is on the driveway the cable will reach it because it's there or it's there or if i have a front-facing charging car we again it will reach whether the car is packed here or here so maximum flexibility oh god that's freezing and before anybody asks yes we've got a rubber seal underneath the garage door which means yes the cable can go underneath it we've always thought about all this but we did get caught out ourselves because i said we had a nissan leaf and originally the charger was over there on that side outside the house because they can go outside weather is not a problem and it meant that when i got this the cable wouldn't reach to here so i had to pay for it to be moved from there to there because i didn't put any thought in it originally now there are a couple of different options if you want uh what is typically a five meter cable that they come with brilliant if you need something longer than that then you can extend the cables that they come with by replacing a tethered charger but it's probably going to avoid the warranty on the charger itself so in that case if you say i want a 7 meter or a 10 meter cable then get anon to the charge point and then you can put your own cable in at whatever length that you bought it at because well everybody's different aren't there right on this enthralling there's only one more thing which you need to put some thought into again to make life a lot easier for you and potentially the person who's going to install it on the day because they will need to have a cable this one here it's quite thick that goes from wherever you're putting that charger or whether you want that charger to go back to your consumer unit or fuse box as a lot of people call it so for example if your consumer unit is at the back of the house in your kitchen cupboard and the charger needs to go at the front of your house on your driveway a cable of this thickness will need to go from there to there so you've got to have a bit of thought where do you know how's the best path some people don't want an ugly cable going across the front of the house so they're made of the arrangements it depends because again everybody is different but you will need a cable to go from your consumer unit your fuse box to wherever that's going to go so put some thought into that because again not everybody wants a cable coming out of the kitchen cupboard throughout the back wall around the side of the house to the front there might be a better path might be a more expensive but better path that you personally would choose they will need to know that before they turn up because they might need a lot more cable it might change the installation costs right okay i'm pretty much done thank you to smart home charge do visit their website whichever path you're going down because there's a ton of information on there not just for charges but also for charge points for cars for public charging costs and there is a referral thing now so i will put this in the description below along with any other relevant information but basically if you decide to get one from smart home charge use my referral link of which i have forgotten i'm i'm being charitable i am getting nothing from this you will get 20 pounds on your octopus juice rfid card which you can use on the charging network many charging networks out there it was going to be 10 each but quite frankly with a supercharger network i wouldn't use it if you don't have one they're free just go and get one and then you will get it so yeah save yourself 20 quid on the public charging network if you're buying a charge point by going to smart home charges website and putting in all the information that will be in the description below i'll probably do it as a pinned link as well so thanks to them for sponsoring and keeping the going that's what sponsors are for it's not just for money and greed of the youtuber it literally keeps us going uh and thank you to you for watching uh i know it's not the most interesting but we all have to start somewhere and these guys need to exist for well people who are new to evs so again thanks for watching see you soon you,1
Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK3qIOtZKVv68oiQbgtv6AVK,Jdmz8-ShuDc,hi guys i'm ivm and welcome back to the now it's back to basics on this partly due to an imploding memory card destroying my previous videos i can't now upload so i'm yeah i'll be honest i'm doing a bit of a rush job on this one but for some reason it is something that i have been inundated with over the last couple of months i don't know why all of a sudden it's ballooned in terms of how many people are asking me this specific question question but it has so i thought let's do a about it and then i can point people to that rather than answer each one individually it's effectively how does all this kilowatts kilowatt hours uh work in ev terms how do i figure out how much i'm going to be paying to fill up my electric car is it that times that uh what's the difference between kilowatts and kilowatt hours uh why is the battery kilowatt hours why all that sort of stuff basically so that's all i'm explaining this one it's quite a straightforward one but given the amount of people asking me this question it's clearly something people need or want to know to aid them buying an eevee at least that's the plan anyway so strap yourselves in in what will turn out to be i'm sure a thrilling an exciting and ultimately one that's borne out of the desperation because i need to get one uploaded by friday right let's start with the very basics 1000 watts so that's 1 000 watts is basically one kilowatt just 1000 grams is a kilogram that's really simple i think most people know that one but what about kilowatt hours if i wrote down one kilowatt oopsie one kilowatt hours what is that what's the difference between one kilowatts and one kilowatts well that is a measurement of power and that is a measurement of energy so in ev terms if you have a charger installed at home which is usually called the fast charger that often or more often than not will be a seven kilowatt charger because that is how much power that charger well technically not a charge but we're not being too in earlier that's how much that charger can put into the electric car so what if you have a car that has a battery size of well let's make it small 28 kilowatt hours so 28 oopsie kilowatt hours that's how much power the charger can supply that's how much power the battery can hold so if i plug that charger into that battery then seven times four equals seven fourteen twenty one twenty eight there we go so a seven kilowatt charger running for four hours would give me 28 kilowatt hours of energy would basically fill the battery up so it takes something running at a constant seven kilowatts which obviously is you know it's theoretical here on a charger four hours from zero to full now let's imagine you get on a rapid charger now i'm gonna pick a figure just make it easy in terms of mass but let's imagine you get a 60 kilowatt charger now um so 60 kilowatts that will give you capital w there that will give you basically one kilowatt hours of energy per minute so if you do plug into a 60 kilowatt charger and it will theoretically run at 60 the entire time which realistically doesn't happen but let's not get too annoyed i say then it will take 28 minutes to give you 28 kilowatt hours of energy because you will get one per minute and it's a 28 kilowatt battery let me rub that out and do it a little bit differently now with real world examples i have a tesla model 3 tesla i'm going to say m3 which will annoy the bmw people but you know it's just easier to write uh i also have a seven kilowatt charger in my garage so i plug a seven kilowatt charger into my tesla which has a 50 kilowatt hour battery okay let's imagine my tesla is half full 50 charge that means that i have roughly speaking anyway because it doesn't always work out this in ev turns but anyway let's imagine i've got 25 kilowatt hour batteries and battery um which is 50 and i plug it into my home charger which usually runs at a maximum of seven kilowatts i'm rounding figures up to make them easy now before anybody mentions it that means if i plugged my car in for an exactly one hour i would end up with 32 kilowatt hours in my car if i plugged it in for another hour i'd end up with 39 and so forth so that's basically what we mean when we go on about charges kilowatt hours kilowatts the faster the charger the higher the kilowatt rating will be the bigger the battery the higher the kilowatt hour rating will be there you go simple as that what about in terms of how much it's going to cost you on your tariff at home now again i'm going to use easy figures let's imagine you're on a 10 pence per kilowatt hour tariff so you basically pay 10p for every kilowatt hour you use on your home tariff so if you plugged your car in then a seven kilowatt charger over one hour would cost you 70p it's literally as straightforward as that if i somehow miraculously arrived home with a completely zero percent flat battery and then charged it up to 50 kilowatt hours assuming no losses so again i'm i'm really making this simple now then it would literally be a case of 10 pence times 50 kilowatt hours so 10 times 50 which is five pounds it would cost me a ten pence per kilowatt hour five pounds to fill up my model three it is literally straightforward as that so if you get on a tariff that has a rate of five pence at night and ten pence during the day then you could literally half the cost of filling your car it would only cost two pound fifty because you're only paying five p instead of 10. this is where a time of use tariff can be very important at making your av run very cheaply i've been on one for years and it saved me an absolute fortune let me now rub that out once more and we'll just very very briefly go over a specific example again just so you all know what's going on if i have a nissan leaf with a i know a 30. remember it's small k large w small h if you don't get that the right way around then anal people will really be annoyed which is why sometimes i deliberately write it wrong hi jason if you're watching so home charger runs at seven remember kilowatts small k big w if i plugged that charger into that car then again theoretically if there were no losses etc etc that would be seven times let's say four hours so seven times four is quite straightforward that's 28 so that would mean that in four hours i would get 28 kilowatt hours of energy into that car almost fill it up pretty much and that would cost me because i pay let's say 10 pence per kilowatt hour again 28 ten pence which of course is two pounds eighty so if you were on a rapid charger that runs a two i don't know let's take this out take that out and that out now on a rapid charger the maximum you'll get into a 30 kilowatt hour leaf anyway it's 50 kilowatts but you will almost never retain that but just for the sake of my argument let's imagine you go straight to 50 kilowatts and stays that the whole time then that would be 50 kilowatts obviously only a 30 kilowatt hour battery it's not going to take that long to fill it up which is why they're called rapid charges and not fast ones so we don't want to do that over four hours do it we just plug it in for well half an hour so that would be well 0.5 which equals 25 kilowatts of energy so we will end up with 25 kilowatt hours of energy in 30 minutes rather than four hours obviously you won't be charging that at home but if you did theoretically do it at 10 pence per kilowatt it would obviously be 25 times 10 and that equals 2 pounds 50. now most rapid charges charge 30 maybe 35 pence so obviously that wouldn't be 10 pence it would be 35 and that would not be 2 pound 50 of course it would be more expensive than that that would be eight pound 75 p so clearly a lot more expensive to use a rapid charger than your home charger if you're lucky enough to be able to charge at home anyway um so that's effectively how we do things in ev world it's very exciting isn't it um it's uh it's it is really a straightforward as that i hope that helps enough people to make this justified and i i'm pretty sure this will be one that doesn't get a lot of views if i'm honest but as i said due to a massive annoying balls up with the memory cards well not balls up they destroyed itself it just stopped working i've lost two complete videos i now have to refilm but considering today is thursday and tomorrow the goes up needs must so apologies that this is uh not our well i'm going to say my usual brilliant but they're all kind of this i guess yeah anyway well normal service will be resumed outside of my drive right now is a persian e208 that's just been dropped off so look out for that i'm probably thinking next friday um so that's at least something to look forward to there and hopefully assuming there's no pandemic changes or mr johnson doesn't change his mind again there will be a uh pull start on the way and maybe even a um a porsche as well so if you do have any questions in related to evs or electricity or tariffs or anything even if it's you know very basic even if you think i don't want to sound a little bit thicker but how does this work just ask them that's what i'm here for i might not be able to get back to you straight away i do have a life funnily enough outside of youtube and literally doing the end of this and the memory card was full i'll tell you there's going to be an earthquake or something it's the the world just does not want me to get a out this week and maybe i should just ignore it and leave it and forget youtube but then the youtube algorithm will punish me for not uploading a regular oh god it's been one of those weeks it really has so anyway thank you for watching if you still are um i won't blame you if you're not but um normal service will be resumed as i said next week with the e208 so fingers crossed all will go well and uh nothing happens to destroy the memory cards on that one but clearly a lesson there in backing things up for me so thank you for watching again see you soon,1
Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK3qIOtZKVv68oiQbgtv6AVK,cwAZK6j5v5A,hi guys i'm ivm and welcome back now the last time i did a about the uk charge network i think it was in 2018 uh and back then it was a much fragmented and complicated and all that different ways of accessing the networks there was a bit of a mess really and it needed a long just to explain to people what you needed to do to access them apps rf id cards things that but now we're in 2021 and the charger network is very different there are a lot more charge points which is good unfortunately it's still kind of fragmented it's a it's unnecessarily complicated but not as bad as it was things are changing and changing for the better contactless payments for example is a lot more common now at least on rapid charges and so this is effectively the updated version of that i'm going to give you a list of all the apps and any rf id cards that i would suggest anyone gets so for example if i was saying no my parents if they've just got a full ev and they said what app should we get what rfid card should we always have in the car in the gold box that's basically what i'm giving you here the list of things i think everyone should have i won't mention every single network i'm going to stick to the major nationwide ones there's no point in me telling you about every regional variation will be here all week so i will show you near the nearer the end of the what you have to do to find out here where the charge points are and what charge point uh network runs them how you access them basically it's very easy it's very straightforward you just need effectively an internet connection and a browser and so we'll do that near the end but for now i'll give you a list of apps and the rfid cards that all ev drivers should have yeah maybe i should just live with that for anyone that is subscribed to the if you're not do but if anyone that is there's going to be a lot of different videos compared to normal because the half a dozen press cars i had on route over the next several weeks of course aren't turning up now given the current situation so uh who knows what you're gonna get right let's start off with this now um i will mention contactless first because some networks just use contactless which is exactly what we want that's how it should be well no that's how it should have been from day one all these charge networks that are proudly going we are now installing uh contactless payments on all our charge points yeah you were told about this over a decade ago and you chose not to and now you're saying it's a positive that you're installing them no no you just didn't have the foresight to see what everyone else did anywho ramped over i'll try not to veer off to a rant through this but we are talking about charge networks here so i can't promise that i uh let's mention the the good ones first the ones i would always prioritize the best i would say and the reviews of charge networks across the country kind of bear this out as well is instavault and i would say osprey which used to be called ngini if you're unfamiliar with osprey don't why you they keep on rebranding themselves to charge networks but i don't know who knows yeah instable effectively very good network most reliable one for me and you just basically stick a contactless card on the side and plug in same with the ingenie slash osprey one uh shell as well shell recharge they contactless too although they do have a nap i just stick with contactless and that's effectively what i'm doing here stick with the easiest option if you want get the shell up as well as using contactless but for me well it's kind of unnecessary isn't it now a lot of bp pulse of their network is contactless as well in terms of their rapid charges but not all of them are so ultimately you're still going to need something else and uh i'll come back to bp pulse later on because they have a slightly more complicated setup than others um bear with me it's just one of those videos where it's gonna sound complicated but ultimately it isn't that bad okay right so one thing that you will some things that you'll need in your ev glove box as it were is of course a smartphone you're not going to get very far without one of these whether it's the browser the web browser or an actual app i'll you know tell you that in a second but you will need a smartphone clearly i would also recommend even though you can pay with contactless with these things to always have a debit card a contactless payment debit card with you because not all charge points work with apple or google pay so your phone effectively i think most people probably will but certainly given the current situation and how good these are now a lot of people are going out with just their phones you'll need the debit card potentially as well righty let's get on with the apps themselves so get your phone ready or a pen and paper or something that these are the ones that i would recommend sticking on your phone ignoring the regional variations i've already mentioned genie point get their wrap ecotricity is the electric highway you will need that as you can only access theirs via the app which is a ridiculous thing and they're all the only charge networks at the service areas which most people call the monopoly and they're the most unreliable network i'm going off on a run again aren't i calm down now yes electric highway app uh the pod point app i will put a link uh sorry a disc i will put something in the description below with this mentioned so you have to you know keep rewinding the um uh bp pulse app as well go for the bp pulse app although you may not need it because of what i'm going to mention later on and that's it that is all the apps i would go for genie point the electric highway or ecotricity's uh pod point and bp pulse the rest can either be accessed via a web browser on your phone you know you scan a qr code or something or it's contactless there are a couple of caveats to that in rfid card world but i'll get to them again in a second bear with me first i'll mention the bp pulse system because they have two ways of accessing their network a pay-as-you-go away which would be contactless or via their app because not all of their chargers use contactless uh and they also have a membership so you pay seven pounds 85 per month i believe it is and then you get an rfid card as part of that membership but you can also charge for cheaper so it makes charging cheaper so this is entirely up to you whether you think it's worth you getting be people's membership or not the rfid card makes things simpler it always does genie point have an rfid card option and it only costs you nine pounds i would probably go for that if you're going to use genie point even vaguely um regularly but in terms of bp pulse you have to pay effectively for the rfid card on a monthly basis because it's part of the membership you get cheaper charging so if you do a lot of charging on bp pulse it pays for itself it might even be financially beneficial to become a member if you're only going to use bp pulse less than two or three times a month it's probably worth sticking with just using the app so that's up to you whether or not you think it's worth it or not now on to the rfid cards which is a little bit um more complicated than it needs to be there's only really one that i would suggest you get beyond the bp plus one i've already mentioned and the optional genie point one uh there's two networks one is called charge your car and one is called chargebless scotland basically the same network if you have an rfid card for charge your car it works in scotland if you have a chargeble scotland card it works on the chargeycar network so don't get them both basically you only need one it's 20 pounds for a year for the rfid card and then that gives you access to it and you have to use their rfid card i would not recommend using the online web version for charts by scotland for example and i go to scotland reasonably often because it's just not reliable enough it's as reliable as a politician's guesstimate so i would definitely get the rfid card if you go anywhere near scotland um what i'd suggest is to just get it anyway spend 20 pounds even if you don't think you might use it a charge to your car or charge place scotland because at least for the first 12 months it's there you never know what's going to happen let's face it if you're spending 25 30 40 50 grand on a car 20 pounds not going to make a big deal is it so get the card stick it in your glove box and if after 12 months when it expires you didn't use it just don't renew it but that is the only real rfid card beyond the optional membership if you choose to go to it that i would probably recommend you go for as i said the genie point you can just use their app the rfid card is probably worth doing for nine pounds i think that's a one-off nine pounds as well so again an rfid would be always easier than an app or a web interface oh actually sorry i've missed another one northern ireland have a network called e carne or maybe ecat ni uh i've i've never used them i'll fully admit that and that is via rf id card so i guess if you're going to or you live in northern ireland you're going to need that one a lot of other ones that i haven't mentioned ionity for example all you need is a smartphone you can do it all on the phone using the web browser you scan a qr code sort of thing so you don't need an app you don't need anything anything specific other than a device that can use the internet so that's what a lot of them do as well personally contactless is always my preference i will choose that for ease of use over a cheaper network which is why i would always say that if you're going somewhere and there are two or three options you know you can say well i could use that network of that work network or another network or some you know they're all in close proximity i would go for uh insta vault first over any other and then maybe i'll spray basically if you use this contactless i would always go for that first because it just works then see also the only way we're going to get rid of the networks that refuse to use contactless payment on all their charges if nobody uses them and sometimes you don't have a choice clearly but if nobody uses their networks and uses the other ones that do take contactless then maybe they'll either be forced into it to survive or they'll just disappear so that's what i would suggest now the regional variations for example if you live in london you're gonna want source london which is i believe an rfid card so now we're going to show you how to effectively have a look at what's in your area or an area you're visiting and what you have to do to find out what network that's on and therefore from that you can find out how you access it oh if you're wondering who bp pulsar they used to be called charge master then bp charge master also known as pull or polar instant if i had their customer service record i'd probably rebrand myself every so often to doing it again aren't i now when it comes to finding out what charge points are in your area there are two websites that i would always recommend using uh one is called plug share so plugshare.com my personal preference however is zap map so that is zap hyphen map.com again i'll put all the links in the description below if you're you know so you can go straight to it okay so i'll assume you're not that awful with using the internet so basically go to google and search for zap map and it will come up straight away zap hyphen map.com on live map on the top left hand corner and you will see this now what you can see here is effectively all the charges and it's uh well there's an awful lot in it so what i want to do is effectively search for where i'm wanting to visit so let me pick the closest place to me skipton that's the nearest town and that will take me to here i'll just zoom out a bit so you can see what i'm saying so here we are in uh north yorkshire and if i zoom in all the purple ones are rapid charges so what i could do if i on this arrow on the left is basically filter it by connector type so i'm going to on rapid charges i just want to see rapid charges okay apply and then what that will do is only show me the rapid charges see they're all purple there you go so that one there that is in morrisons so just off it and then on the other one that is in the high street car pack and it tells you there see where it says osprey that is the the network effectively that uh that is using if you on that page or that part of the page it then gives you more information this tells me that uh the ccs 50 kilowatt uh 50 color and type 2 is available it will say it's available for all networks i should point that out it on zap map only has live data for certain networks but basically it tells me what type of connector they've got this one for example is telling me that someone right now is using the chademo connector which a nissan leaf uses for example what i would do then is on the i down below and that will tell me all i all the information i need tells me where it is for your sat nav if you want to find it what network it uses apple pay oops apple pay you can use the app or zap pay which is something that map have implemented now effectively accepts contactless and credit cards that's all i need to know that's how much they charge and it tells me when it's open what type of place it's in in this case a car park so that that basically gives you all the information you need if you on the morrisons one and that again it will tell me the speed of the charges type 2 chademo ccs if i on the i at the bottom again the address it's a genie point one i can use the app or the rfid card if i have it that tells me how much it costs me to use it and a few of the details and also pay attention to the parking because sometimes you do have to pay for packing whilst you're charging so it's worth reading that type of thing another thing which i'm not going to really go into too much detail on this particular but what you can do with that map if you on the panel on the left side again so let me just get rid of that filter for a second is on root planner uh let's imagine i'm going from skipton to i don't know manchester that'll do um and find root i'm not gonna go into as i said too much detail but effectively i pick which one i want of two options using google maps so i'll pick the one on the left that's orange select and what it will do is give me all of the charges within i think it's a mile or two of that route so if you think i need to charge on route somewhere this will give you all your options there are very you can change it a lot and again i'm not going to go into it on this but that's effectively how you can plan a journey as well or if you're wanting to charge on route so if i wanted to charge there i'd on that and it would tell me that this bp pulse one is out of service as of five minutes ago so it's definitely worth checking on stuff this and that's basically it really um so zap map or plug share and that will tell you what the charge point is what network it uses and then once you know what network the charger that you're wanting to use uses you can then find whether you need the app for it if you haven't already got it if it's contactless brilliant you don't need anything you've already got the debit card or the phone yeah that's it we're pretty much done really that's all i would recommend as i said there are regional variations so if you live in london source london makes sense get the rfid card for that and so forth and so forth okay well thank you for watching do because i'm going to be doing an ultimate guide to ev ownership and usage and charging you may already know that if you're watching this after that's gone out um so yeah do it does help channels mine if you've got any questions comments that's what the comment sections are more than happy to answer them it does get busy sometimes so give me a bit of time and if you've got any rants or statements about the state of the charging network feel free to litter the comments section with uh with well we all a good moon don't we especially me right thanks for watching guys i'll see you soon,1
Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK3qIOtZKVv68oiQbgtv6AVK,_8yf_F1u2g4,hi guys i'm avm and welcome back now one of the most system if not common questions i found on this over the years is what do i do with my fuller true vehicle that might be different to a petrol engine car if i'm not using it for any length of time so for example if i go and hold it for two weeks do i have to do anything specific to one of these now given the current state of affairs at the moment in the world this question has peaked in popularity somewhat so i thought i'd finally answer the question what do you have to do to a full electric vehicle if it's just such standing not being used for let's say a couple of weeks or more now as you can tell from this this is a petrol car and as you can see from what this idiots pointing up this is a 12 volt battery in a petrol cap most people are aware of what this does and the fact that ironically in quite amusing link to electric car owners if this battery is faulty or just not charged that carries useless the petrol engine car will not work if its battery is flat now this is a full electric car and under here is a 12-volt battery just you get in a petrol engine car and this is just as crucial to an electric car as it is to a petrol cap if that's flat faulty or unplugged this car will not work even if the main high voltage traction battery is full it doesn't matter that thing takes care of all the dollar entry systems the infotainment unit the headlights that wipers and without it you're not going anywhere now a petrol car charges of his 12 volt battery by using one of these an alternator and that is only going to charge the battery up when the engine is running so if you don't run a petrol engine car for several weeks there's a good chance you're going to come back and find that 12-volt battery it's flat because the engine doesn't run that but she doesn't get charged up electric vehicles this one do not have alternatives but if not how an electric car operates they rely on the main traction back through the big one that everybody is always concerned about that is what charges of the 12-volt battery now let's imagine that this is the small 12-volt ancillary battery and this is the main high-voltage big battery clearly not to scale but you get my point now in pretty much every electric vehicle on sale this the big battery will charge up the 12-volt battery when you're driving that car so if you getting in turn the ignition on i guess whether you're driving or not this will start to top-up the 12-volt battery now some cows will top up that 12-volt battery whether you're driving it or not for example my previous v's to this one the nissan leafs that will top-up the 12-volt battery even if it was just sat on the drive not doing anything if this got to law this would for that so you didn't really have to worry about the 12 volt battery at all in fact this can the tesla model 3 does the same thing it tops up the 12-volt battery whether i am in the car or not so logically you think what brilliant abdo after worried about it but it's not quite a straightforward does that sumi these out there and this is where i need your help in a second we'll only charge the 12-volt battery or if the ignition is on if you turn that car on so if it's something the guide where it won't do anything it will only work only do anything with the small battery if you turn the car on so as a broad sweeping stim the only thing i can say to everyone is to look after your 12-volt battery turn your electric vehicle on at least for 15 to 20 minutes a week to make sure that 12-volt stays charged up now i'm gonna have to ask everyone out there all the male of the species to do something which goes against my very nature as a man excuse me nearly threw up saying it but you're gonna have to check your manual you're gonna have to get the manual out of the car and read it that's the only way you can be certain you know how your specific eevee is charged how it looks after that 12-volt battery now to help each other out to make sure all the blocks don't have to read their manual if you have an electric vehicle whether it's an ips and i3 and ionic leaf tesla anything read the manual tell us what it says about the 12-volt and what you have to do to look after it and then put it in the comments below just say on page 56 it says this about the jag your eyepiece so other people don't have to suffer through reading that book so onto the main high voltage traction battery the reason that brought you to this what state of charge should you keep this at if you're not going to be using the car for any length of time now both manufacturers and battery experts all say the same bank for lucas sometimes it does differ but i would call it a assists on there is basically a safe zone of between 20 and 80 percent charge to keep your battery at optimum health that doesn't mean you can't go out of that range just that it's not recommended you go out to that range at the very long so for example if i was going long journey now i would happily charge to 100% because i know that i will not be out of that safe zone as it were for very long because i'll be driving the calf and on the flipside if i had 25% left on the charge and i needed 10% to get to my destination it wouldn't bother me by going out without sifts on as it were because i know i'll be charging when i get to my destination so between 20 and 80 percent for any battery really not just car batteries that's the the safe zone as i'll call it now i'm not going to suggest that you keep between 20 and 8 then what i'm going to recommend is that you keep you between 60 and 80 percent now this is because of something called vampire drain or care is still on even though it's not on you know it has an alarm for example so all cows will lose charge over time some are worse than others for example this guy is the worst i have ever heard of by a country mile in fact i have the manual here and i'm going to read what it actually tells me about this vampire drain and it also highlights why i think it should keep it between 60 and 80 percent charge even when the model 3 is not being driven his battery discharges very slowly to power the on-board electronics the battery could discharge at a rate of approximately 1% per day though the discharge rate may vary depending on various factors such as cold weather vehicle configuration and selected settings situations can rise in which you must leave the model 3 unplugged for an extended period of time for example at an airport traveling in these situations keep the 1 percent in mind to ensure that you'll leave the battery with a sufficient charge level for example over a two-week period 14 days the battery may discharge by approximately 14% tesla voluntary is the worst out of a lot of my nissan leaf as an example would probably only drop maybe 4 or 5 percent in a two-week period maybe not that and it's got a much smaller battery let's imagine i do go away for two weeks and i leave it with in the safe zone at 30 percent charge if i went with 14 days in this it would drop at least 14 15 percent therefore by the time i came back the car wouldn't be at 30 percent it would be around 4 dean percent this is why i would go for sixty to eighty percent it gives you a much bigger vampire drain buffer so if you do go away for a long time the longer the better and if a two-week holiday turns into a three-week holiday for whatever reason you've still got that extra buffer to use up under the vampire grin so if i had 80% charge and i went away for a month 30 days i would probably want up to 40% just in case so i would still be within that sifts on started at 80 got at least 40 by the time i get back a month later everything's fine so this is why i would go for that period it allows affordable for you don't need such a ridiculously large buffer in overcast for example the nissan leaf as i said before would probably in a month or any lose i don't know some that eight to ten percent maybe i'm never really trying it to be honest but you still need to build that into it so whatever charge you leave yeah it's kind of dictated by how long you think that car will be sat given the current situation we don't know when it's going to end so stick it at 7080 percent and that way it's got plenty of vampire drain buffer to go out until you get out about it's a safe zone of twenty to eight percent and you have to plug it back in again it doesn't really affect it as much as people think if you leave a battery 100% for a couple of weeks on holiday anything oh no i forgot it's not going to kill the battery it might slightly increase battery degradation but it will not kill the battery it is very much if you read the manual of a petrol engine car it will say do not use full throttle or drive aggressively until the engine is up to full temperature but people still do daughter they know that if they drive aggressively and the engines not flute to temperature yet it might degrade the engine you might you know it might reduce the lifespan of the hinging but he doesn't kill it does it he just slightly reduces it everybody knows that they should eat fruit or vegetables and eat healthily and that's fine and you are allowed even under a health diet to have the occasional take where that's bad for you as long as it's not very often often not a long time so don't get paranoid don't get worried if you leave the you know carry 100% or it drops below 20% it's not gonna kill the thing it's just if you can with healthy eating stay within that safe zone of between 20 and 80 percent and that's for any battery your laptop your ipad your 4 right so summarize i would recommend if it's sat for any length of time and leaving it between 60 and 80 percent just to give you that extra buffer just in case the vampire drain reduces it and reduces it to a point where it will get out of that safe zone of 20 to 80 percent you right that's it pretty much oh it's duster here we'd have to clean the kerrigan and i so yeah hopefully that was useful to someone and do to the the one thing that this lockdown is hang-gliding for a lot of vv channels my own is that you can't go and do the videos you want to do you know the test drives everything's under lockdown with cat got all of it and quite frankly the contents quality isn't as good as most people want how about some people unsubscribe because i'm no longer test driving cars i don't know what cave they are living but ultimately that's not by choice so subscriptions and revenue have substantially gone down since this lockdown started it's not just normal work even youtube's been affected that and the weather of course that affects how many people are watching the internet it seems so if you can't do it really does help small channels such as why you're on yep that's it pretty much thank you for watching stay safe as usual i'll see you soon,1
Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK3qIOtZKVv68oiQbgtv6AVK,upo7CkjuCZM,hi guys i'm avm and welcome back now if i said to you that i've just bought a new petrol car and you're just 30 miles per gallon i think everybody out there watching this will know that that's not a particularly efficient car 30 is not very efficient if i said it needs 70 then everyone would know that that's very efficient it's going to save me a lot of money on fuel but when it comes to electric vehicles it's a little more complicated than that not so much the figuring out how much it's going to cost you but partially because manufacturers in their infinite wisdom have picked one of two different methods on telling you how efficient their cars are some use miles per kilowatt hour which is very similar to miles per gallon i prefer that one if i'm honest and others used watt hours per mile now this is something i don't think anybody unless you own one anyway really knows what is good what is bad what is average in terms of fuel efficiency is three miles per kilowatt efficient is that average is it is it bad is it good it's 350 watt hours per mile good it's 250 watt hours per mile better than 350 how is it the other way around so it is quite confusing but once i think it's explained properly and uh i've shown you how to convert one to the other if you're bothered i'll do that at the end of the it is very straightforward um then i think it will be easier for you to understand what's going on in terms of fuel for an ev so let's get on with what will turn out to be i'm sure another enthralling for everybody involved oh sorry i'm just looking at the smart home charge brochure now channels mine survive due to occasional sponsorships i have no patreon campaign um so do listen because not only will this help the out it could actually genuinely save you money and i don't put stuff on my if i don't think it's genuinely useful i don't just take any sponsorship and believe me i get inundated with offers this effectively is a comparison tool so i have all the electric vehicle based tariffs so i'm talking about your home tariff now this will tell you which one is cheapest depending on which car you have so let's have a look at this now i currently run a standard tesla model 3 range plus that's the battery size that's the charge speed that's the range according to the manufacturer and let's say i do 200 miles per week so i adjust that there and then it tells me how much if you're on october score for example or edf go electric these are all ev tariffs from various uh suppliers out there which one is cheapest and how much roughly it will cost you per year per mile and for a single charge so ultimately this could genuinely save you money because you might be on the wrong tariff if you charge at home it's just as important as how much the petrol station costs down the road for example i've seen people drive another mile or two across town because it's one or two p cheaper per liter for petrol so five ten minutes of your time could end up saving you tens or even hundreds of pounds on your tariff because that's effectively what's fueling your vehicle if again you charge at home so do look at that i will put the link in the description below and as a pinned comment so you can go straight to it and the more people that on that the better it looks quite frankly and more likely future sponge soup deals for anyone ah so it's helping the out by checking this out but again i wouldn't put this up if i didn't think it was useful and at the end of the day it's free you're not losing anything you're not going to buy into this and of course they fit my home charger they're still i'll be very busy they're still fitting charges around the uk all have approved all the usual stuff so visit smarthomecharge.com or on the link below ideally now in terms of what's efficient and what isn't efficient in ev world i'm going to have to move over to that awesome whiteboard over there right here we are the whiteboard itself now i've put a table here with miles per gallon in according to a 2018 rsc study the average miles per gallon for a new car in 2018 was 50 i think it was 50.4 so i'm going to say that 50 miles per gallon is the average which i would say is about right from my own experience so 70 is definitely above average and 30 is below average now of course you can get less than 13 you can get above 70 if you try hard enough but ultimately these are about averages so what is the equivalent in terms of miles per kilowatt and watt hours per mile and then i'll show you the conversion of how to do the conversion later on in the so if we say that's the average because it's amber of course that's below average that's red boo and this is the efficient one green if we said that's green that's amber that's red what would be the equivalent in mass per kilowatt hour now this isn't scientific as in energy use it's not a direct equivalency of uh you know how much you've burnt or created or used or any of that this is in your head what is average oh that's below average ooh that's above average so in miles per kilowatt hour there's no real studies on this one so i've had to use effectively 500 years of my own experience and of course speaking to many other people i know with evs and so i've decided because it does change you know winter is less than summer how you drive obviously has the biggest effect um so what i've decided to go for is for average 3.75 miles per kilowatt hour i would say that is the average for the average electric vehicle some of course will be more than that some will be lower than that that is the whole point of an average and of course all year round if you drive economically all the time you will see higher than that if you've got any nero you'll probably again get better than that if you've got a an e-tron you'll get lower than that i suspect there's many variables so i've had to try and pick the middle ground here and now for below average i'm going to say 2.5 miles per kilowatt hour i'll explain kind of more what they mean later on but effectively if you get in that that's pretty bad it's uh maybe a spot version of an electric vehicle or you're just driving around a lunatic who knows uh now what is good it's effectively gonna be quite obvious is this i'm gonna put five miles per kilowatt hour for example when i got the skoda city go and i was hooning it around country roads during summer granted i got just over five miles per kilowatt hour when i drove it economically to working back in slow speed traffic i got over six miles per kilowatt hour but i've had cars that are more around this range as well so again this is about averages and this is what i've decided after lots of only ooming and airing have where to put it so the equivalent in ev terms of average for me is this in the uk of course and of course if you're across the pond this is uk gallons not american ones so yeah i'd say 3.75 is pretty fair all year round um but what is that in terms of watt hours per mile for this we're gonna have to do a conversion so it's exciting stuff because it involves maths well i'll show you how i do the conversion in a second but effectively 2.5 is 400 watt hours per mile so in this case the higher the number the worse it is 3.75 is 266 i have rounded these numbers up of course uh and five miles per kilowatt hour is 200 watt hours per mile so anyone with a tesla will be familiar with this and one with uh well most of the cars will be familiar with this but across all evs not just tesla's not just key narrows not just nissan leafs i would say this for me is the average in terms of energy efficiency now this again as i said before is the easiest to understand for me because it's the closest to miles per gallon miles per kilowatt hour we buy our energy in kilowatt hours therefore all you have to do is say well i get charged 10 pence per kilowatt hour so these are the figures i need to be able to figure out how much that is going to cost me uh what hours per mile i'm not sure why some manufacturers choose this or ultimately why don't why they don't give you an option tesla's for example use was per mile as i said why can't you just flick a switch to make it turn into this it's all software-based it seems easy to do but there we go as another example in the real world i drove just as a test down to my parents house in the tesla model 3 the standard range plus and i got 197 watt hours per mile going down there because i deliberately drove economically effectively parked behind a truck or a coach for 200 miles of the 250 i was doing on the way there and just left autopilot to do the rest on the way back i drove it to normal motorway speech we say and i got closer to 267 so clearly how you drive has a substantial effect on the efficiency just it does with mass per gallon now how do we change that to that well it is very straightforward and it effectively just involves the number 1000 let me wipe this off now so i can show you using a formula because that's even more exciting isn't it all that work gone gone gone thirsty work is all this teaching right let's imagine we have four miles per kilowatt hour and we want to convert that into watt hours per mile basically we take the big number one thousand and then divide that by the miles per kilowatt hour four which effectively gives us 250. so 1000 divided by the miles per kilowatt hour gives you the watt hours per mile but what if we want to do it the other way around that's pretty straightforward as well all we have to do is get a rubber wherever put it there we go take that out instead of that divided by that we do that divided by that so 1000 divided by 250 is four it's literally that straightforward so let's put that to the test what is 2.8 miles per kilowatt hour in watt hours per mile quite straightforward one thousand divided by two point eight equals 357.1429 four two nine there we go 357.1429 watt hours per mile so if we did 1000 divided by that it would equal that so all you have to remember is 1000 divided by that number gives you the other number literally as straightforward as that right we're pretty much done uh thanks for watching and do nearly 70 of the people watch my videos aren't subscribers let's see if we can change that and of course don't forget the comparison tool on smarthomecharge.cod uk's website i believe it will genuinely be helpful to some people out there uh that will be in the description below of course with the link and as a pin comment so thank you for watching thank you to mr whiteboard and of course to for the maths i'll see you soon,1
Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK3qIOtZKVv68oiQbgtv6AVK,HDMReL9H8Iw,hi guys i'm abm and welcome back now wouldn't think that cropped up on this all the time is of course range and i can guarantee that i will get a comment in pretty much every every i do certainly any that mentions range from an audi diesel driver that says that until they can get an electric vehicle that matches their range 600 miles to a tank they're not interested and i am not genuinely bashing how many drivers on this one it cotton it crops up all the time i have an audi diesel and it can do this much that's what i want in an electric vehicle that's the whole purpose of this and i really wine bar behind me to try and make people really wait what they actually need in terms of range because it's alright saying i have 600 miles but if you never ever use it and i'll explain what i mean in a minute what's the point in having it what's the point in electric car terms of paying for something that you're never going to use so that's what this is ultimately about how much range do you really need now i've looked at various studies to give us all the facts that hopefully i'll need to fill in this table and then well just watch the you'll understand what i mean the first one is an rsc sorry i've got it right here that they did and they asked what the longest drivers are prepared to go without taking a brick so are you prepared to drive two hours without a break for six a you get the point this i think is quite interesting because a lot of people out there i'll go back to the audi driver again the 600 miles to attack 600 miles will take you even without traffic well 10 11 maybe 12 hours in the uk to drive nobody drives that amount of time without stopping at least once it'd be dangerous beyond belief to themselves and to other world users due to driver fatigue let alone needing a pee or something to eat so how much do people actually drive according to this study and then i'll come to others in a minute now the first one the two hours about 99 percent of people say they're happy to drive at least two hours i think this pretty much is a given we all do that helped in bad traffic he probably takes me that long to get home from work some days so that's that's fairly ordinary but i will come back to that to our figure in a minute because there is something that is worth mentioning three hours or more we have 90 percent of drivers are willing to drive release three hours four hours is a big drop 58 percent of people say they're happy to drive beyond that so a lot of people to stop at the three four hour mark we have another significant drop of five hours at 28% so clearly it's going down down down and we're getting to the point where people are basically just boasting that they can drive this long without stopping but i'll fill it in anywhere there are seventeen percent of drivers are willing to take the risk of driving at least six hours without stopping then we get to 10 percent and finally eight hour 8% and remember this isn't a professional driver this isn't someone that's driving for a living this is people basically going on holiday doing a long journey and quite frankly if you're in this bottom kind of bracket seven or eight hours certainly maybe six that's idiotic beyond belief doing seven eight hours non-stop with one driver i think that is it's too dangerous seven eight hours is a full working day non-stop driving it's a big deal it's dangerous again for you and the people around you i know somebody having very close to someone who got tired on a long journey and they ended up basically falling asleep at the wheel flipping their car on a dual carriageway they survived thankfully but it just shows you how dangerous it can be people don't take it as seriously as something drink driving for example but it is a big thing now i mentioned the two-hour mark and that i would come back to it and that's because that is what the highway accord in the uk recommends that you should drive norm or ban before taking a brick rule 91 this is a uk highway code of course rule 91 of the courts there's their brick of at least 50 minutes should be taken every two hours with regular bricks essential in keeping a driver focused alert and above all safe on the road now i think that's pretty what you're given that most people out there will be going i don't do that i don't do that personally rarely anyway certainly on a journey that's three four five hours in total distance i don't think i will probably stop after two hours i mean with traffic that's that's that's barely a journey is it now obviously that's the highway code which most people probably do ignore but within the eu this is a direct quote from this study within the eu even people who drive for a living are not permitted to by law to drive for any more than four and a half hours before stopping which is roughly about there now for me that's about right i think far enough hours is enough to get a good part of the journey over with and a lot of journeys completed but not too long i guess it depends on if you've been working or they're not but ultimately if you're just basically i'm going on a journey you had a good sleep for enough hours is about right for me which i think this study can assures there's a significant significant drop between four and five hours now pretty sure that's just for professional drivers hgv cooke drivers not everyone in general but there is a reason why professional drivers hit givi drivers can only drive for four and a half hours maximum by law and that's because any longer would be dangerous so once we're getting into seven eight hours of driving that's immensely stupid probably it's but not probably it is it is immensely stupid because that's nearly double the the legal amount for a professional driver so i guess what you need to do now is look at this and say well where am i you know be honest with yourself how often have you driven more than four hours in the last 12 months is it once is it twice many times from that we can probably get roughly how far you can realistically drive given the limit you've just imposed on yourself if you say i never drive on four hours i get bladder anxiety well before we get to five six hours certainly then how far could you realistically travel in the uk because this is a nuclear how far could you realistically travel without stopping as in you're the reason to stop not the car for this i'm going to turn to a department for transport stood it basically the uk government and that gives us the average speeds on uk roads and according to them the average speed for the strategic road network of this country is fifty nine point two miles per hour apologies for my writing so fifty nine point two miles per hour a strategic road network is basically motorways major roads and dual carriageways for all the other arrows so this is i guess all of the roads other than residential streets things that the average speed is just a paltry twenty five point four miles per hour now these strategic road network carries about 1/3 of all traffic but only accounts for about two percent of all roads but that is what you will traditions ii if you're doing a long journey so that's what i'm gonna merely go off i'm not gonna have ridge these and then use that what i'm going to pick is 55 miles per hour in terms of the average speed that you can achieve in the uk on a very quiet day nighttime things that and from that we can figure out how far you can drive in two hours three hours four hours five hours now of course people have a mixture of this 25 miles per hour on average and that of 59 so this 55 is pretty much the best case scenario it's nighttime driving if you live near lee moore to in your destination is just off the motorway so there's not many people that without doing silly things breaking the speed limit which i know full well nobody watching this ever does my viewers do not break the speed limit do they 55 miles per hour as an average i think is about right and feel free to look on google maps at various journeys that you do and then figure out the average miles it's probably going to be that obviously if you are one of those drivers that weaves in and out under takes people and does 100 mile an hour on the motorway that's probably going to be higher than that but you did a bit of it i'm not going to say the word so to be introduced because some people will say i do long journeys all the time i can be 55 miles per hour i'm gonna do that times the hours out 20 so in this case we have 130 miles if you do know no more than two hours of continuous driving and then have a brick three hours of course would be 185 miles four hours using my mouse brain now would be 240 miles five hours 295 miles get more to write six hours if you really do want to drive six hours non-stop and i guess we've all done it then we're looking at 350 miles is that serviced you can travel 405 again with that added 20 remember an eight would bring us to 460 miles so this is where you need to look at this table and think where am i if you drive for hours for example and then have a break you never drive modern for hours as 58% of people admit to then the most you're ever likely to be able to drive is 240 miles even and a very very light traffic and you need more to is you're coming off more to it's things that fast roads so if you are mister aldi driver and be honest with yourself now and you think you need 600 miles of range you only do at most 240 miles before you stop anywhere you are the reason it stops not the car and that's why i'm trying to make people really it here most people on the motorway network right now in petrol and diesel cars are stopping because they need to not because the car needs to that's the whole point that you need to can reevaluate what you've had because it's not the same thing just again to put this into little bit of context london to wedding ruins mouth well just shy of 400 miles according to google sauce centre of london to centre of edinburgh and it reckons about seven and a quarter hours to do just under 400 miles so it is about the right sort of guesstimation in terms of what you can do on a quiet day i remember driving to my parents house once which is about 260 miles away and it was closer to the 25 miles per hour average than the 55 min they do to roadworks traffic and all the usual stuff we have to put up with we'd be interesting to know what people in other countries achieve i don't just mean what you do when you're trying to boast about what i mean what is the average in your country america for example which this isn't really about but i will mention in a second much bigger distances between towns places and you know villages that saw stuff so this is very uk eccentric but this still applies the driver even an american one will get tired at the same sort of timeframe as a uk one or a european one so the maximum amount of range that you would realistically need it should be logically the same unless you're willing to drive for longer but then you're risking getting tired and having a crash now said at the beginning the purpose of this is to make you reevaluate what you believe you need in terms of range but let me make this extremely clear this is the worst case scenario the amount of times let's say if you're this person here i do not more than four hours of driving so you think well i need a car that can do at least 240 miles in the real world on the motorway in winter what you want because the vast majority of people will only do that journey twice a year three times a year something that now with electric vehicles as it stands they are more expensive than petrol cars i say this time and time again according to the ceo of volkswagen itself we will achieve price priority by 2025 there will be the same price as the equivalent petrol car but for now they are more expensive and in terms of range you pay for that range you know the more batteries the more expensive the carries so what i'm going to try and get across is that yes you may be able to do that journey if you have a long range even right now without stopping at all but if it's something you only do two or three times a year what's the point i'd rather stop you know what would be what three times a year on the journey maybe what six there and back if it means i don't have to spend another few thousand pounds to get that range in the first place eventually there will be a problem in all levy's will probably be longridge there will probably do something this without breaking a sweat but for now let's take them at model three for example it's roughly is it's six or seven thousand pounds more than the standard range and you'll get about another 80 miles 90 miles of range what's the point in pain another six seven thousand pounds just so you can do that twice your journey without stopping you might as well save you money and think well i'm gonna have to stop which ultimately is what the highway code recommends anyway so that's up to you if you can afford the long range car then of course you're gonna go for it because you've got it there but the original premise of this are still stands the range that you probably think you need isn't probably true worst case scenario not average most people we'll be doing what 10 miles to go at shops and back 24 work something that if you look at the uk averages this will never be a thing people mention it all the time we only do i think 12 miles a day on average in the uk why would you need something then can do five 600 miles on a single charge if you're doing even 20 30 50 miles a day everyone is different and there are exceptions to every rule so you'd have to tell me if you were about exception but that's the whole point of this has it worked has it done its job have you really read what rindge if you don't have an eevee anywhere that you actually need if you do have an eevee have you really worried what you thought of you thought lastly i don't know why i thought i needed an out of range because i don't never go above 30 miles a day or 50 miles a day or whatever even building in battery degradation i believe that if you have a less set here in error which will do about 250 miles in the real world so that means you can drive four hours in a kia near or without stopping no problems at all but if that's again a 20-year journey worth the extra to get that range only you can answer that let me give you a scenario we have done the north course 500 many times in electric and petrol cars when we did it in the electric car a key in a row that was the last one we did in i think yes it was i think we stopped about halfway because it's a four hundred each mile journey for us we've stopped about halfway to charge get something to eat and then went on to inverness which is to start them off cost journey complete won't stop when we did it in the petrol car if i could have done it a few times in a petrol car we stopped at the same place to get something to eat because it's such a long journey we wanted to stop for our own benefit not for the cows so whether it was electric car or a petrol car the journey was the same don't think what you have is what you need because how often do you use that full tank of petrol most people i know usually just flew up to half anyway or never letting go but get below half but either way they're only using half a tank at any one time it's always nice i think from anyone's point of view to our backup tune all that you've got that range but if you've never used it and genuinely no look at yourself look at your kalki journeys how often do you use a full tank of fuel without stopping that's hopefully what you'll get from this immensely interesting as usual thank you for watching do it really does help me get more cool whiteboard stuff and so yeah thanks for watching guys and i'll see you soon,1
Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK3qIOtZKVv68oiQbgtv6AVK,ujEKO1l1e54,hi guys i'm abm and welcome back to a rainy north yorkshire doesn't this feel homely again normal all this sunshine for the past few weeks just wasn't right was it now in this i want to talk about range anxiety because if you're a daily mail journalist and i use that job description lightly it's all electric car drivers think about it occupies our every waking thought every time we get in the car i mean right now i'm sat on my drive thinking do i have enough range to get the car back in the garage it's it's playing on my mind typically this is something which people think about when they get to the stage of almost buying a tv so affordability is fine you've started out charging and then the common question again is it's this rings anxiety thing it's bugging me is it gonna ruin our experience is it gonna spoil getting an eevee so i thought i finally do a on it see something in the last four or five years i've never really mentioned that much haven't certainly done a about it does range anxiety actually exist in the real eevee world is it a problem well i might as well start with answering the question itself does reg anxiety exist and the answer is yes it does range anxiety exists but not probably in the way you think it does and it's not the problem most people believe it to be in their head let me explain what i mean if you've been driving more than just a few years in a typical you know a petrol cow for example then you will have experienced range anxiety we've all done it at some point in our driving lives you will get it to zero on your fuel gauge almost running now getting to the next petrol station because it's 1p litre cheaper something that we have all experienced that ooh i'm gonna minute i'm gonna run out crap about to get some petrol you get my point it's a rare event but it does exist you can experience anxiety in anything that is capable of running out of fuel the probabilities of course are lower that you will experience it in a petrol car to an eevee but ultimately you have experienced it but the only way you will is by putting yourself in that situation by ultimately letting the fuel run down to the point where it's to law or not stopping when you should have done ultimately you're insensible and it was your fault that you experienced that anxiety with an eevee it's very much the same thing the chances of course are higher because the ultimate max range is lower at present than any then a petrol car equivalent but you will only experience you were going to be a problem basically if you put yourself in that situation that's the point i'm trying to make here i'll give you a couple of scenarios which have happened to me in the past on camera in fact about two and a half years ago ish i was doing a long journey in my 30 kilo hourly fork out that was 1900 miles on average and i were doing over 600 miles in that single beam that single journey so it was a mammoth task and a silly telling i was doing the basically i was picking up a lot of garage flooring doors that watch the will probably remember it and basically i experienced that anxiety on my way back home i was i wasn't too far away i will one stop before then after that getting home and i basically got cocky in fact i'll put the clip up now and it explains what i mean not the microphone on so you have to excuse the bad audio but i have 11% on the battery i'm 11 miles from the charger and he's heavily snow hoping we're affects the rig more than i thought he would and i got cocky and thought no i'll go for the next charger so now i'm kind of wetting myself ten point six miles i think he said and i have 11% off ultimately i put myself in that situation i definitely wait no no i'm we're gonna get somewhere i had that range thing that people worry about but it was my fault i shouldn't have skipped that charger i should have stuck to my plan and i would have been fine it would have been all right no problems at all but no that was me that was my fault and that is the whole point however with an eevee sometimes it's not all your fault or at least that's how it used to be see before i give you that scenario let me explain about the rapid charging network and how it's changed in the last 12 months it is massively and i do mean massively better now than it was just a year ago or even certainly 18 months ago the nearest rapid charger to me about a year or so ago was 19 miles away so a 38 mile round-trip to get to a rapid charger and if you don't know a rapid charger is that is one of those mega expensive charges that you see your service areas which gives you 60 70 80 % charge in half an hour 45 minutes i think so yeah the ones you want to do to visit to do a long journey now however again just about a year later i have for within 9 miles of me and one of them just a few miles down the road and in the next several months lockdown aside there's going to be another couple turning up so it's getting exponentially better almost on a month-by-month basis and the example i'm about to tell you wouldn't happen if i was doing that journey to do it because of the numerous honest of the charges in that area on the network so ultimately it's something which shouldn't happen today or at least the chances of it happening now are far far less than what happened to me two years ago and that's this we were driving back from a camping holiday so again we were all in the car the car was full with all the camping gear and we got to the charger it was a pall of rapid i believe and i remember pulling up to it quite clearly it was off as in powered down slice wandered unplugged it but according to the app he said it was online so of course i remember ringing them up and saying oh yeah anything you can do about it it's not working and it says well our systems swords charging right now is that you yes of course it's me that's why i'm ringing you up saying i can't charge but anyway it was off there's nothing we could do with nothing they could do about it and we thought well let's go to the next one which was an electric highway charger should have seen this one coming but basically that didn't work either so we went to the next one basically this the plan see i suppose that was 13 miles away and the calf and i could figure they range out myself by that point i've driven it for a few years and i knew how much i could get out of each percent 13 miles away and we have 13 miles of range as in not on the guess our meter on in my head of actual range so oh that was definitely range anxiety time especially for my wife of course and at that stage even though we donned an eevee for two or three years he was my fault for buying it so yes it was brown trousers time quite frankly and we just had to go for it so anyway we ended up getting there with point eight percent zero point eight percent of charge that was definitely squeaky boom time now i've looked at that same route today and if we'd have had this exact issue as in we gone to match charger and it wasn't working we'd have had numerous more options today because of the amount of charges that are around different sites so we wouldn't have been in that position now that happened i think about two and a bit years ago when that one happened so it's it's a very rare thing today to experience range anxiety in an eevee that wasn't your fault i guess in parts of the uk it is still a possibility at the moment we can't remember we are in early adopter stage you know that that's what v's are as soon as you accept that fact we are still finding our fee in in in eevee world the infrastructure is still small i mean i think it's um 1% or something that of all uk cows on the road a full electric it's a very small amount still so if you always be sensible have a plan b and i'll explain what i mean in a second you shouldn't experience anxiety at all it will be on this thing you put yourself in it shouldn't be that you should be able to rely on charges but unfortunately that's the way it is in five years it probably won't be there are charging hoops sprouting out all over the place insta volt for example the putting one in i'm not sure where it is actually somewhere down south it's always down south and that's gonna have eight into the bulk charges all in one place a basically i a supercharger hub and once you get that sort of thing doctors around the country you can rely on it you can go to it and you will guarantee at least one of them or more will be working so this is something which i think is going to disappear in a very short space of time but i guess does exist you shouldn't but it does you just if you accept that you're fine i mean if you're doing a let's say 200 mile journey in a cow that does 150 miles in the real world or something that don't aim for the charger that's 140 miles away so obviously you're enough to charge once to get to your destination don't do it at the very limit of the cows range it doesn't give you any buffer any backup there if there is a problem for whatever reason for however rare it may be don't put yourself in that situation i would probably go for a charger around one hundred hundred and ten miles something that and then if there is a problem with that you go on the next one and it's a problem with that you've got the next one but the chances of that happening or what less now than they ever have been and again it will diminish over the coming months and years on day to day stuff when you commute in going to the shops and back of course it won't exist in any evie that you buy right now you will be fine doing anything other than a ridiculous commute on the daily basis so it's only really the long journeys where they say creeps in anyway if you're going ten miles to work and then back again any evie he's not gonna have a problem with that and shops and whatnot a petrol car the audio experience range it's usually if you put yourself in that position of nearly running out but certainly given the current porsches i think there's going to be a significant push in this next coming 12 months on top of what's already happening given the the green agenda that seems to be pushing out from this canal lock down experience i think there will be a significant leap forward for the uk but ultimately when we get to that stage for all challenge networks when there are eight points every site rather than just one or two it will be normal it will become just a petrol station i mean i have come to a petrol station before i'm about five or six years ago i had a car which had to have shell v-power you know one of those and ultimately i remember calling up the air one and getting to my usual stop off i was visiting my parents so it's not a journeyer dude that often and the petrol station was gone it had been flattened they were doing a full ground-up refurbishment so it meant i had to go to the next one which wasn't a shelwyn and of course me being me i a nana i'll go to the next the next petrol station up the air one will be shell and it wasn't anywhere i did finally find a shell petrol station was open but i add well it gone past zero i was a little bit nervous and again that's basically what i'm trying to get across here in this if you do that in evey world you're gonna experience it if you're a bit sensible you walk for me there are compromises in everything it's less convenient to have to stop on a long journey in and evey depending on what sky you're in now anyway but the significant significant cost savings more than offset the inconvenience for me personally especially when you do in nearly twenty thousand miles a year and then cost savings a huge so again we're at the early adopter ish stage we're still coming out of almost beer to testing expect there to be inconvenience is that you shouldn't have that will disappear eventually i think the trouble is people assume it's a direct replacement for what they've known for the past few decades as if it's going to be the exact same thing it isn't electric cars are a car and you drive them in the same way but there is a bit of a culture change there the best analogy i can think of and it's one of use before it's having an iphone you know how to use it you're very familiar and it makes phone calls and goes on the internet if someone then gives you an android phone which does the same thing much an eevee does the petrol car you will still have a few issues where you go well how do i do this in this form where's the settings okay am i dragging up or down it's the same thing but you have to learn the differences and there are differences and that's the same with these things there are a few differences when it comes to refueling if you and it's not just a direct swap and you just put in a different type of fuel it's not i gone from a petrol to a diesel car you have to learn a few new things to own one and have no issues and that's the whole thing put bit for bit of effort into something in life and you'll get the rewards back out of it it makes your life easier funnily enough so yeah that's pretty much it really if you do have any questions i said of four or five years i've driving around in an eevee and i've never run out i have the many silly challenges which means i've nearly run out and i've got cocky as you showed as i've shown you and i and i've put myself in situations where it's it's made me nervous and certainly my wife but but yeah any questions feel free to ask in the comments below do as i say in every because it makes a big difference press cars and press fleets start to reopen now under the lock down some on the way so watch this space but there is a significant backlog and the big boys and the big magazines are going to be first so yeah let me all we think in the comments below thank you for watching and i'll see you soon,1
Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK3qIOtZKVv68oiQbgtv6AVK,X_AO4jN-kNU,"hi guys i'm evm and welcome back now about a month or so ago i sold my nissan leaf it was a 30 kilowatt i were a center doing about 54,000 miles and it was three and a half ish years old now what this means is that i can tell you how much this car has cost me in terms of total cost of ownership we're talking tires maintenance services m or t's fuel which is easier to figure out than it is in the petrol car and of course the big one the one that people always mention that i don't think about enough when i go on about running costs depreciation i know how much i sold the car for i know how much i paid for the kind of first bliss which means i have all the data i need to know how much this car is cosmic throughout its entire time with me the whole three and a half years i'm also going to try and compare it against an equivalent petrol or diesel car and figure out how much it costs in terms of pence per mile so let's let's get on first thing to do is to bring up all of the different areas so here we go we have fuel tires mot and servicing depreciation of course and ve d slash cat tax whatever you want to call it i'll start off with putting all the figures up first and then i'll go through them one by one in terms of how i figured out each and how i've got to that figure i have deliberately left out insurance on this one because in my experience insurance is dictated harada the price of insurance is dictated by the person more than the car for example a lot of work got a quote for the nissan leaf and it was about four times more than we were paying even though it's the same car same age same everything so insurance i think is in is in part of the cows cost it's the part of the person's cost to drive however i will tell you how much this cost us just so you have those figures right here are all the prices will start with fuel one thousand and sixty five pounds 450 450 thor thor thor 1060 five pounds 450 thor 1060 five pounds for 54,000 miles let me just repeat that 54,000 miles and the fuel cost is just over a thousand pounds if you don't believe me on this one there are several videos in my where i've gone through the cost of fuel and electricity in this case of an eevee i will put the link to those videos in the description i'm not going to explain it and extend this up to do that but basically i challenged my car at night when it is very cheap i have a time of day tariffs and if you plug a car in pretty much any electric vehicle if you plug it in to at dinner time you can set a charge timer either on the car all the charges themselves now and it will charge when you want it to when it is cheapest so that is how i always hit the cheapest time in terms of charging the car external charging cops are included as well of course but that probably counts to five ish percent of my total journeys in terms of when i charge away from home you charging things that as i said the figures of how i've come to that are in several of the videos which i'll put in the description below but suffice to say i pay on average 13 pounds 50 per 1000 miles when i charge a home now tired i have gone through i think it was two sets on the rear and three sets on the front and the average at about sixty sixty-five pounds sometimes a little bit more per corner and a one time i got all four done there was an offer on at the time and they were quite cheap but basically i've overestimated in fact i'll say that now all the prices i've shown you here in and giving you these are over estimations i am biasing it away from an electric vehicle on this one i have spent less than seven hundred pounds on tires but i've just added a bit more just so people can't accuse me you have been biased against the the petrol engine to make the evey figures look better the leafies have lit a hot-hatch that requires some really expensive rubber but i have put some decent stuff on it typically mitsubishi across climate pluses next will be mot slosh servicing now the cars only three and a half years old so it's only had one mot and that sailed straight through so that was effectively a 5-pound cost the servicing all done by nissan main dealers and it's probably worth pointing out that if you went back three or four years or further the price of nissan's servicing your minor major minor major was a lot cheaper it was about i think was hundred pounds when i got my first leaf this is before this came along and now for that very same service just two or three years later in terms of when they changed the pricing it's now a hundred and fifty pounds for the same thing a 50% increase in service costs for the same service in about three years partly why i didn't want another nissan that is basically what it's cost me over the last three and a half years because there's almost nothing to service on an eevee it's evinced alongs original discs and pubs because the regent takes care of most of the breaking in an eevee who quite warm we're in this lovely hooded fleece i may have to get to drink from this water bottle if i'm not i won't have a drink from this water bottle i think i will have a drink from this flask i'll be honest i don't know why i bother doing that because it's not as if i can send anyone anything at the moment right vd or cat axes a lot of people know it as vehicle excise duty this is of course zero for a leaf up for any electric vehicle at the moment and what smothers it zero there's no cost there now on to the big one depreciation the thing that people always say i miss even though i don't when i'm estimating rooney costs of electric vehicles i know how much i paid for the car in fact i will show you because as always on youtube you have to prove everything that you say or do this is the the finance agreement that we took out on that leaf back in 2016 there's a registration number that everybody should be familiar with and the price also not percent financed so didn't need to pay any interest either which unfortunately some don't do anymore fifteen thousand seven hundred and twenty eight pounds now if you're wondering how i got hooked a good deal on what was a cab out of this price of close to thirty thousand pounds it's just because it was a slightly different time back then there were a lot heavier discounts then than there were now and the list price is something which i say time and time again just ignoring it doesn't come close to what people typically pay i mean who buys a ford focus or a fiesta and pays a list price it doesn't happen unless it's something special back in 2016 and further back from that there were heavy discounts for four v's because they were trying to attract early adopters the average price of a 3000 our center my car back in 2016 was probably about seventeen seventeen and a half for anybody that actually bothered to bring more than one dealership and i got mine fifteen seven and whatever it was by literally just doing that ringing around and finding finding should i say finding a dealership that was desperate enough to sell me one probably just wanted to hit their target i knew the car and you the spec and even the color i knew everything i didn't visit long them up said this is the car this is a price this is the spec can you do it and one of them did so that's how i got it that's such a good price and before anybody says i got a deal cuz i was on youtube in 2016 i think i got about i don't know two thousand subscribers or something i was i wasn't really on youtube at all right so we know the buy price the sale price was ten thousand five hundred pounds now this is something that i was slightly miffed at because just nine months ago maybe a year ago from now that cow was worth about twelve and a half thousand and i was thinking brilliant whenever i get to sell in that car and getting wherever i want next barely lost a penny and then in space of nine months maybe a year it dropped from thirteen twelve and a half it's a ten and a half but that's how it is isn't it with with cars but yeah so that was the total depreciation which was five thousand two hundred and twenty-eight pounds at this stage just to head off what inevitably is going to be tacked in the comments well you're not factoring a new battery of a few years it still happens i still get that stock coming the battery warranty on that cap is eight years or a hundred thousand miles and that guarantees a minimum state of health after that period not that you need a new battery after an eight years i've done this time and time again in fact i'll put another link to a in the description below about batteries so if you before you say that you have to factory battery replacement do watch that okay battery swept aside because it would not be a problem and it won't be a problem for the next person the boy off me either the total of all that is seven thousand four hundred and forty three pounds that is absolutely everything excluding insurance i have spent on that car if you're wondering insurance clusters between two hundred and eighty and three hundred and fifty pounds over the three and a half years we have back at when a good edge now where it doesn't seem to matter walk out we get it doesn't cost that much more if we put that into pence per mile just our curiosity the total running costs in pence per mile is thirteen point eight hence per mile and i said that's not fuel that's not running costs that's the whole car everything if we take out depreciation actually if we just look at running costs how much would that bit wow four point one pence per mile that's how much it cost me for fuel servicing tires mot all that and people wonder why i bought my second electric vehicle three and a half years ago that saved me an absolute fortune given the mileage i do so i think what we don't have to do now is try and compare that against the petrol or diesel cap so what i'm gonna do is ignore the price of what people paid for that petrol car take out depreciation and just see what the other figures were all right so the petrol cap you can tell i've been on google images let's have a look at tires mot servicing cat tax as well rved and then look at the fuel costs depending on what you would get in terms of maths per government so i'm gonna give us three figures here forty miles 50 miles and sixty miles per gallon to see what the fuel costs would be those different rates remember that fuel cost if the entire life of the cat the whole 54,000 miles not what you get on a long run not what you get if you drive it economically all of it everything and for the american people watching its uk gallons not american ones which there is a difference okay right so the tires i'm just going to assume it's the same seven hundred pounds so there's no difference between the leaf and focus on golf let's keep that the same the mot and the servicing again i'm gonna feather this on the side of the petrol engine or diesel engine 450 pounds now look at nissan's prices on their website if you don't believe me and all the manufactures as well the servicing costs for a petrol engine are more than an equivalent electric vehicle but again i'm going to keep it in the same so let's imagine the mot and servicing and the tires are identical for both the petrol and the electric cap now back in 2016 you could i believe get some petrol engine cars that was zero as well on tan in terms of car tax so again i'm gonna favor their petrol car by assuming that nobody back then for three and a half years has paid any vd or car tax depreciation i'm gonna ignore for now as i said so let's now skip to just the fuel now for this i've used a nice website fuel economy calculator basically this is the sort of thing that you get so you just put the miles in the miles per gallon and the fuel costs now again this is something else which i have to stick is very very much in favor of the petrol engine in terms of the figures i'm about to show you i'm using the fuel cost as i can get down the road today which is the cheapest it's been four years one pound and three pence if i looked at the average over the past well three and a half years it would probably be about one pound fifteen one pound 20 pence per liter this is immensely cheap and i'm gonna pricing it today as pricing not at what it actually would have cost me had i got a petrol engine sorry a petrol engine car three and a half years ago so this in reality would be a bigger sum in terms of how much you spent on fuel okay if your car got sixty miles to the gallon on average over the entire fifty five thousand miles which is very very good and then you would have spent four thousand two hundred and fourteen pounds on fuel fifty master gallon just over five grand and if your car average is 40 master gallon throughout its life then you would have spent six thousand three hundred and twenty one pound on petrol alone and remember that's it today's prices not of the prices you would have paid over the last three and a half years that all those figures should be substantially higher but again i'm gonna bias it towards the petrol engine so people do use me of favoring electric let's add them all together so basically ties the service in unpatrolled and the figures in red are the total running costs of these petrol engine cars these mythical ones over the last three and a half years fifty five thousand miles so seventy seven thousand not 77471 is the most expensive one if you got faulty mastered gallon and five thousand three hundred and sixty four if you had a nice efficient petrol engine that give you sixty miles per gallon let me add the leaf on to that now just so you can see the yet seven thousand four hundred and forty three pounds for the total cost for the leaf so you can see there that compared to a sixty months but gone car he'd just over 2,000 pounds worse off in my leaf but hang on a minute i have not even factored in the car yet the depreciation is zero on the petrol car which means that if your car average is 40 mounted gallon you're worth peered more or what basically the same then i have and that's assuming somebody give you that car for free let me just add depreciation onto those figures to say we'll come out with assume it's the same as the leaf so all petrol cars that i've got here and the leaf depreciated exactly the same in reality the electric vehicle depreciates less than the petrol one because supply and demand are nowhere near look at the difference if your carriage is forty massa gallon or it's the entire life then that means you're spending five thousand pounds over five thousand pounds more than i would have in the three now fee is fifty five fifty four thousand miles so a guesstimate somewhere estimates a lot of them are very accurate and overestimate in favor of the petrol engine as i said the fuel prices on the petrol cars should be a lot higher than that because the petrol prices were a lot higher over the last three years in the art today so this is best-case scenario for the petrol engine and yes still 3,000 pounds worse off on an efficient petrol car that's why i chose to leave all those years ago i do a lot of miles it saves me a lot of money and it means that the next car i buy the you know but the reason i got the tesla is because i've saved so much in that three and a half years as the phrase girls look after the pennies and the pounds will take care of themselves that's my philosophy anyway now let me be very clear here i am not saying that an electric vehicle even today's electric vehicles that do a bigger range a suitable for everybody i could not own an electric vehicle if i couldn't charge at all there is nowhere to charge anywhere near me i live in north yorkshire no way to charge i could not survive without home charging so i'm not telling everyone out there go and get an electric vehicle you'll save a fortune not everybody can charge at home not everybody could survive with the range but that i have if you have the option of one this just proves you that financially they make a lot more sense than people believe the total cost of ownership is ultimately all that matters yes you need a deposit that's the sticking point the reason why it took me four years to get that tesla model 3 sat in my garage today it's cuz i have to save up such a large deposit to make the month of repayments cheap enough for me to be able to afford it what i'm saying is don't just look at the price of the cat look at how much the car should be worth in three years time how much you'll save in fuel costs are lon again if you do a lot of miles there could be huge when i first got my nissan leaf i had a bmw 330i a total gas guzzler and that used to cost me well over it was two hundred and fifty pounds a month in fuel alone and it was a beautiful karen pietsch ever an engine but i bought the leaf it cost me i think of two hundred pounds a month did the very first leaf and i was saving i think was two hundred and ten pounds a month at that stage in fuel so i was saving more in fuel than the car cost me quite frankly not percent finance nor deposit you can see where the figures come from here so yeah okay they're not for everybody arriva is at the moment and they're not just for environmentalists i am not an environmentalist i never have been i've never mentioned the environment as a reason to buy an electric vehicle i've always gone down the financial route now i have that tesla it's a lot more expensive but as long as it doesn't depreciate too much in terms of value then i'm not going to lose out the best way of looking at it is if you buy a fifteen thousand pound car that's worth ten thousand pounds in three years it's cost you five grand in depreciation if you buy a car that costs thirty thousand pounds that's worth twenty five thousand after three years it's cost you five thousand pounds in depreciation the total cost of the car is the same even though one is a lot more expensive the only sticking point is that you need typically a bigger deposit and maybe even bigger monthly repayments but at the end of the day when you sell that car you get all that money back so there's still an affordability issue there absolutely no denying that one right that's pretty much it guys let me know what you think in the comments am i still relatable if you've got a petrol car do you think well i didn't think it'd be that good or are you one of those that for some reason absolutely hates the electric vehicle and it's an affront to everything you believe in and it doesn't matter what information or data is put in front of you you will never learn that's fine that's your choice and i am not saying you should go out and get one i'm just displaying figures and then saying right there you go i'll leave it to you so thank you for watching fingers crossed they slot down what go on forever although it looks it's going to be on for a while so i'm afraid i'm kind of stuck to the studio slash spared office in my house with the shelf behind me so thank you for watching and i'll see you soon",1
Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK3qIOtZKVv68oiQbgtv6AVK,-mhEtIm3GmU,hi guys i'm eevn welcome back to the and welcome to my new smart charger when i say new evaluate a few months but basically this is the or me intelligent wall charger i've had it for a few months now and i have to say i'm impressed enough to be able to do a about it saying that if you're looking for a new home charger this is the one i would go for clearly because it's the one i did go for but you get my point out of all the ones on the market out there this is one of chores and this is why so why our vault charges on the maquis did i pick the or me well ultimately it was first i'd say three main reasons the first being value this is i would say at the all say it's the cheapest but it's certainly one of the cheapest tethered charges on the market now that's not to say is cheap it does actually have a unique selling point which i'll get to in a second but ultimately it's a it's good value and you know what value means to myself everything almost but ultimately yes it's it's it's an entry-level price but it's not an entry-level featured charger i'll put all the basic features and the link to the website and that in the description below if you want to delve into it in more depth but yes the the second reason and this is something which pretty much every tesla owner always tells you especially if they've on the car for a few years how many times have you heard someone say that they're care that tesla just gets better and better with age it'll get a software or firmware upgrade and almost sudden it does something new it didn't when they first bought it you don't have to buy the latest model to get the latest features it just it just gets it with the software upgrade and that's how things should be these days it's basically a software controlled piece of hardware the army is very much the same sort of thing really it's a software based piece of hardware that gets upgraded all the time if there's a new feature that they think should be implemented or that someone's recommended that they implement then everyone will get it the that this does now that he didn't when i got this a few months ago it's getting better with age anything whether it's a tv a tablet a phone a laptop a camera that should all get these over-the-air upgrades it's one of the key things when i'm looking into an electric car does it get better with it does it get over-the-air upgrades the ford mackey that went to see that does the testers of course do and i'm sure all the manufactures will do the same thing because it makes sense it's that's two reasons it gets better and it's a good price point the third one this is a little more bit more complicated so bear with me but this is i would say the main reason that made me gravitate towards this charger or overall other ones and i think it's right to say it's a unique feature of this charger put simply the target will sync with the electricity tariff you're on and then make sure it always charges assuming you set it to anyway at the cheapest rate so for this i'm gonna have to explain what electricity tariffs i'm on for the fully to then make sense about why this is such a good thing right now i'm on an octopus tariff called agile i used to be on gore and now i'm an agile and i haven't compared the two so no bother asking me but basically this tariff is different from many others because traditionally a lot of people out there will be on a flat rate tariff you'll pay 15 or 16 pence per kilowatt hour day and night for your electricity just bang batmen some people will be on a flat rate during the day and a flat rate a cheaper rate at night but the agile tariff differs in the fact that the tariff changes every half hour this is based on the wholesale pricing of electricity and said it fluctuates every half hour this is an example you can see that it's a lot cheaper during the night and if we go to the peak time now for between 4 & 7 p.m. it's a lot more expensive because that's the peak time it encourages people to shift their usage as much as possible to off-peak rates it helps the grid it balances things and it ultimately saves you money typically what are no electricity company will do is they'll have a peak grid an offbeat career and then they'll average it out and that's how you'll pay if you're on a flat tariff whereas this one literally does that now it's only really the portal 7:00 p.m. that's very expensive but if you can move your electricity usage outside of that period then it's typically a fair bit cheaper to you especially if you can charge it at night now this is something that's very easy to do with the no electric car over half of my electricity usage is my electric car i do a fair few miles and uses slightly more than this house does now this makes sense very much on the army because the the charger knows the tariff the octopus is sending 24 hours before as you do as a customer as well so if i have that charger and i'm on agile that knows how much is going to be costing me today and tomorrow so let me give you a scenario why this makes sense imagine i come home at 6 p.m. after work and i plug the karen i have told the or me charger that i want 18 miles of range by tomorrow at 7 a.m. for when i wake up so it'll go right you need let's say 15 kilowatt hours of energy it's 6 p.m. now and i've got until 7 a.m. tomorrow to charge your car so i will pick the cheapest times the cheapest half hour periods to charge your car so not only will you wake up with your 80 miles of range but it will have picked the cheapest times the cheapest half hour periods so you peer as least as an amount as money as possible which is a good thing for the electricity you've used in your car it knows how much you're going to be charged in advance who knows how much energy you will need by tomorrow via your schedule or manual input and it will pick the cheapest time to do that this for me is i'm also a game changer but this is this is brilliant it's the internet of things it's things been connected it's it's synergy is how things should be as i said half of my electricity usage eats my car if i do this or rather i do this for all my car chargers at home so instead of paying 15 16 pit pence during the day whatever you might be on i'm paying on average i would say four to six pence during the night and sometimes money once twice three times a year the agile tariff actually dips into negative value so you actually get paid to use electricity it's very rare but it does happen so yeah this makes total sense he knows what you want when you want it buy and how much you're going to be charged between now and the time you want to set off in the morning he saves me money the charger is one of the cheapest to buying in price terms and it helps the grid you can also tell it to pick the greenest times of the grid so it also knows the average co2 i think it is all that basic agreen and greedy's are expected to be over the next day or so so if you want to you know ignore economics and go down the ecology route you can say always pick the you know the charging times of when the grid is at its greenest so you can you know lower your co2 impact if that if that's the thing that bothers you you can do that as well it's got all this data that's available to everyone it just it cobbles it together and make sense of it and saves your money might help save your cabin impact it you know it's it's so simple i don't know why no one's thought of it before basically it really is oh before i forget actually smart home charge that installed my charger they're basically going to linking with this undo a special offer on the army wall charger i'm getting nothing for this there's no referral bonuses or anything the discount is all yours so if you are thinking about getting an e v charger in the nearest future lick again that'll be in the description below to smack home charges website on that link and you'll get a genuinely special offer price on the or me so if you do want to go for it do have a look at that link there there is one thing actually i would to see and i believe they are working on this as well and that is an ifft integration if this then that anyone that knows their smart home devices will know exact amount about if you don't don't worry about it but it would be nice to have if integration so we can make our own recipes open and do what we want with it that would be quite nice i believe it will happen so yeah that's another book thing it will happen just gotta wait for it oh and although it's still in beta so i think you have to ask for access for all this but i don't think you belong without it out it will link in with them alexa sorry i'll just everybody is alexa off now have enough not you go away it will link in with your amazon echo so i can basically tell my mini a cause i've got died around to start my car charging or change the you know desk area you don't forget you fallen out your pocket so it's not a big deal but again it's nice integration it's the internet connected of things it makes sense synergy right let's have a look at the app now so you're in the settings and if you've got to change your lectricity tariff you can see there the companies that they currently support so if i on octopus energy i could put my postcard in it'll come up with every octopus tariff that there do that well that is ever-growing it used to be just octopus and now they're all included so that will get more and more when you get the app you basically put your car in so you on nissan you can link it with innocent account so it can automatically get the stay of charge which for the most part works but nissan nissan servers are dick you lessly crap it's not all cars of course have an app so it just then assumes that your carries empty this is something i would them to change these are the options you can fear the green energy so this basically makes it charge faster at times when there's a lot of wind and solar optimized for battery life so it will charge the battery that charge your car at a slower rate to help the battery life and of course the all-important save money button so prefers charging when electricity is cheaper this is what it looks when the car is not plugged in it tells you this this of the last charging session and your green score how much co2 you put out how much energy was used the last time you charged we've just done a preheat which is why it's very law right my wife is finally home from work so i can show you the app when it's plugged in and what is a great feat of continuity on my pad if i change target here i can the mac's switch to mac's charging button which basically just tells it to chad flat out from now on ignoring any cost you can see there he knows my caries currently on 21 miles in terms of range left and it's set to be at 100 percent by 7:00 a.m. tomorrow so if i can bring it a bit closer you can see there it's about quarter to 10:00 to 8:00 now it's good doing no charging and then it's gonna start about a half past eleven giving the care about almost half charge but then it's going to stop again you see that line there because that's more expensive than this period here and then once it gets that point it will carry on charging because those two periods are the cheapest time during the night on my tariff stay awake thank you so you can see it's doing its thing it's doing nothing then charging then do nothing then charging and that is exactly what i want it to do to charge at the cheapest time for scroll down it will give me the estimated cost for this charge a whole one pound seventy four about 70 percent charge on a 3000 our leaf cost per mile estimated total savings versus standard tariff so in one night i'm saving to pound 23 they even gives you how much co2 you're likely to use how much you've saved over a cabinet of 33 muscle gallon and how much energy will be used later on tonight so nineteen twenty one point five kilowatt hours will be going into my cat and ikes it's quite law if i want to change tomorrow's schedule which is for every morning for us then i'll just on that and adjust the slider there depended on the target range and if want there to change the time so let's say i want to get up an hour earlier by 6 a.m. i want a 70% charge save and you're done right well that's pretty much it i'm not going to bother setting up the camera just to say goodbye and thank you for watching but once again if you are thinking of getting an or me charger look in the description below for the special offer from smart home charge again i get nothing for that it's all your discounts or if you want one that's the best time place to go if you think about getting a normie or you've already got one put any questions in the comments below the occasion wahby and no doubt watching as well so they're probably well-placed to answer them i'll try and answer them myself if i can apparently it is putting up the christmas tree time for me so i guess i'll have to edit these and i can as usual i'm doing everything in a rush and last minute but if you've been watching thank you for doing so and because it really does help so yeah thanks for watching guys and i'll see you soon,1
Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK3qIOtZKVv68oiQbgtv6AVK,1DBR__nqy7g,hi guys i'm ivm and welcome back into what is turning into a bit of an annual event on the it's effectively a list of all electric vehicles full electric vehicles that are coming out this year 2021 in the uk i'm not going to give you every version of every car so i will say the tesla model 3 as opposed to the tesla model 3 standard range and the long range and the performance so this is every car rather than kind of different battery sizes or something that of course some of these will be guesstimates as th they're meant to be coming out this year so some of these are cars that are out now and that will be still out in 2021 some are cars that are slated to be out so uh yeah right now before we get any further the needs your help or rather i need your help because well i'm the now i've told her the idea of doing a patreon campaign in the future you know where you can donate to the to help it out etc etc and but i haven't i've relied on a little bit of google adwords and a lot of the occasional sponsorship which is effectively what this is so what i'm saying is if you were someone that would be willing to donate two or three pounds to the don't do that spend two or three pounds on a botb ticket and you might win yourself a car you'll help the out because even though i don't get anything for each person that clicks on that link in the description i do get them wanting to come back and sponsor a future so basically the more people that do it the more likely they are to come back only rather than giving me two or three pounds you might end up winning a car a porsche tycoon or something that anyway so yeah if you can do the link in the description below it has to be that link otherwise they won't know you've come from this now in what nobody is likely to skip the contractually obliged text that i now have to read out and do listen to it because it gives you all the details don't skip it i can see you doing it i can see you going to that marker massive thanks to botb the dream car competition company for sponsoring this butb have had two decades they've been around a long time and i've used them quite a bit in the past two decades of winners and they now give away two cars each week with tickets just starting at 40 pence their dream car competition has won over 180 cars that you can choose to play for and every single one now comes with 50 000 pounds of cash in the boot so you're getting 50 grand under car i mean come on it's better than donating to a isn't it this includes a large selection of electric vehicles the porsche tikan or the honda e little things that or to test the model 3 performance there's loads of them you only have to be over 17 to enter and the competition closes at midnight on sunday so get your tickets as soon as possible and don't forget you need to use the link in the description below i will also put it as a pinned comment as well if you don't do that they won't know you come from me and it won't make a difference to this anyway right let's get on with the itself the the topic a list of cars i've decided to do it in order of price so we'll go with the cheapest first down to the most expensive uh and it starts with the smart for two which is a car that's been around quite a long time to be honest it said refreshes don't get me wrong and it's just under 19 and a half thousand pounds i should point out that all the prices i'm mentioning are list prices okay the ranges i'm using are real world ranges or predicted real world ranges not the wltp range that manufacturers spout out you've only got a range of about 60 70 miles though so it's a bit of a tough sell if i'm honest uh it's clearly just going to be a second car or a city car next is a new car it's not quite here yet it is just a shared under 20 000 pounds at least in the smaller battery version it is the fiat 500 electric the new one uh i said just under 20 grand and just under 100 miles range in the smaller battery version i think as a second car or as a pure city car it'll be a very good one i can't tell you what it's about because even though i've emailed them once a month for the past four months they haven't even bothered to reply to tell me that i'm not suitable or i'm not big enough which i wouldn't mind at all i'm not everyone everybody's flavor i'm not big enough for every manufacturer even though i think they're the only ones that don't actually reply uh so yeah fiat don't bother replying to me the pr people anyway so uh i can't tell you what it's but don't tempt my students applying to an email does it it's rude just over 20 grand now we have the smart 44 basically very similar to the previous smart i mentioned just before seats same sort of range though so again it's the same kind of tough cell just over 60 70 miles of range now what i would probably go for in terms of small cars city cars or secondary cars if you want uh it's uh well the next two cars are actually basically the same it's a clone of each other the sayat me electric and the volkswagen eup just under 23 grand and just over 23 and a half for the volkswagen i tested this code of citigo which is no longer sold in the uk for some reason they've pulled the car fantastic i loved it i thought it was brilliant they really are fantastic cars and then practically identical to one another so whether it's the volkswagen europe or the sea at me electric they're just very very good and i think as a second or as the city car perfect quite different next just under 24 and a half thousand pounds but it's a large car it's an estate and it'll do roughly 160 70 miles in the real world year-round average the mg-5 now this is a car which i should have already had and it would have been on the by now but unfortunately the pandemic has meant that it got cancelled so it'll be in the near future hopefully but yeah the mg5 just the zs which will be coming up very soon in fact you can't really argue with the value next we have the mini electric for just over 25 grand which is basically the same price as the petrol version you're getting a full electric mini it's only going to have about 115 miles of real world range but you know again there's a second car more more than enough now we're moving on to a practical family sized suv the mg zs ev of course 25.5 grand although discounts are available if you look uh well not too hard really roughly 140 miles of real world range can't rate this highly enough it's not the best car in the world but there is nothing close to that in terms of price and size and practicality in the electric car world now a car i have just received an invite to the launch for in march anyway 25.5 grand ish only a roughly 110 miles of real world range it is the mazda mx 30. again they've kind of done what many have done let's try and get one at a good price and see what how many batteries we could put in there rather than giving it a range and going wow we're selling a 30 000 pound small car that's normally 15 in in petrol car world so i got my manufacturers doing this i will put uh the links to any videos by the way if you they'll appear in i think that corner um if i've reviewed the car already so if you want to watch uh the review for that and i will also put in the description below actually a link to a playlist of all my ev review videos the e208 is one that i thought i think is a very good looking car probably the best looking small hatch for me uh 26 nearly 27 000 pounds but there are good discounts available on this i've seen them for about 24 and a half roughly 178 miles of range real world and it's part of the psa clone so there'll be a few more coming up very soon now we have the nissan leaf the 40 kilowatt hour leaf just under 27 grand list price 130 odd miles of real world range this is one that even though i've had two leafs and i thought they were fantastic this is one that i probably wouldn't recommend going for and i've seen a few high milers and the batteries ain't in great shape so if you want one then it's good discount and you're not going to have it out of warranty fine i just i just worry that the fact that the lack of thermal battery management it's not the rapid charging thing it's the longevity of the batteries that i worry about with those now another psa clone similar to the peugeot 208 the corsa e i will be getting this in the next few weeks again lock down the side um just under 27 grand same range as the peugeot pretty much but it's the corsa version of it i saw two of these for sale brand new unregistered for 22 000 pounds this was back in august now we have the best car in terms of pound per mile of range that you can get it is the renault zoe the 50 kilowatt hour one starts at just under 27 grand but again a car that comes with a lot of discounts if you uh look around enough you will get 200 miles out of these which for a car which i've seen for just over 25 grand by uh just a little bit of googling again you can't really fault it in terms of range and per mile of range pound per mile of range anyway the honda e now a car i thought very very highly of it is one of the premium uh kind of prices over 27 grand for what is a very small car tiny boot but it i just loved it it's a ground pv it's it's fantastic a car now which i thought would slip under the radar it's effectively similar to the peugeot e2008 and the ds3 crossback e10s but uh the citroen ec4 for me its unique selling point and again you can watch more on the review in the it was just super comfortable and quiet so i definitely think it's one that's uh worth a look at just over 29 grand list price but again you'll get discounts on that roughly 170 yard miles of real-world range now a car that is not out yet but is due this year and i'm pretty sure will turn up this year it is the skoda enyak iv or four meant to be about 30 000 pounds roughly 200 miles of range so as far as though it's effectively an id for clone it might be really good skoda usually do do better value cars effectively a better value of volkswagen a car that is due a refresh this year very soon the hyundai corner starts at just over 30 grand for the smaller battery version anyway very efficient just the kia which is effectively again a clone of the same sort of car uh i i personally prefer the ian the kia e nero over the corner it's a bit bigger and more practical but you can get this in the smaller battery version as i said just over 30 grand 180 maybe 90 miles of real world range and now we have effectively a competitor to that the peugeot e 2008 starts at 30 and a half ish slightly less range than the smaller battery corner but you will get uh discounts on that as well as obviously will for most as i say so yeah i that i thought it was a better looking car the e-2008 is the best looking kind of compact suv i reckon on the market now we have yet another clone of the psa group the vauxhall mocha e it's the 2008 basically worst name in the world for me i don't that name i don't know why um sounds a coffee but just under 31 grand same range as the e2080 2008 ds3 effectively the same battery size and motor so i guess just which one you prefer if you are looking at the psa group as as an option for you now we have the nissan leaf again but the e plus version so this is one that uh comes with the biggest bigger 62 i think it is kilowatt battery again i think it's way too expensive for what you get the shoe on the massive battery in a space that still has no thermal battery management i would worry about its longevity 32 and a half over 32 and a half thousand pounds it'll do over two hundred miles just in the real world but something else which has pretty much the same battery size the e nero for example will do 50 miles more than that now we have the well i'll put these together the volkswagen id3 again a car i should be getting very soon lockdown pending and the cooper elbow which is effectively sayat's version or cupra which is a sub brand of say at now uh it's it's an id3 it just looks different i think the l bond looks nicer than the id3 personally and saya will or cooper should say will probably end up doing it slightly cheaper than the equivalent battery sized volkswagen id3 either way you're looking at 33 34 000 pounds for now they are coming out in cheaper versions um for the id3 and the l born next another psa group clone in the compact suv sense the 2008 and the mocker the ds3 crossback e10s now this is effectively pitched in its 34 grand starting price it's effectively the premium version of the psa group it's the lexus to the toyota effectively we're into just under 35 000 pounds now the kia inero a car i nearly bought and i have to say is one of my favorite evs on the road well over 250 miles of real world ev range you know i don't normally go for suvs but i really did this and as i said the efficiency for the kia's and hyundai's which effectively share the same platform it's off the charts another key is next although it's more expensive 37 and a half the key is so levy now this is a car i didn't i didn't get on with as well as the nero compared to other people on youtube because i just didn't see where it fit it's an inero but with the boot chopped off a lot of people look at it as well i don't need something as big as the e-nero it's the same width it's taller than the knee nero it's just not as long but you lose that in the boot so you've got a relatively impractical boot but the front end is an inero in terms of its size it looks very different it's it's got a brilliant audio system i should say it's got a unique look to it don't get me wrong there is reasons to get it i just think if i'm going to spend that amount of money on that car i would prefer the inero every day it gives me the practicality as well as the range next the car which has been out a long time yet he's still asking premium money for it for me and i think it's well overpriced but there are discounts available just under 40 grand for a bmw i3 it's yeah it's got the carbon fiber chassis which i3 owners constantly bang on about have been a major bonus it's no longer a bonus otherwise bmw would still be doing it even bmw say you don't need to do this any longer for weight saving it's unique it still looks cool and just under 40 grand is anybody seriously suggesting that's 500 pounds off for tesla model 3 but cracking used buys i think in the used market the i3 is the one to look at almost first now we have a car again that is slated quite this year it is the ioniq five it's effectively uh a sub brand of hyundai i believe that they're starting around 40 grand 260 maybe more miles of range uh again it should be very efficient if it's anything the hyundai's and keyes and this is it really that's not much more i could tell you about it's uh meant to be coming out this year fingers crossed it does we have the mercedes eqa now about 40 grand roughly 240 50 miles a range who knows it's meant to be effectively a compact suv mercedes well they're putting more effort into evs so i'm looking forward to this sort of stuff and again at the same sort of price bracket 40 grand this we've got the nissan area 260 miles of range way better technology than the leaf e plus look at the difference in what you get it's streets ahead it's light years ahead of what the leaf is which is why for me the leafs they should just get rid of it now in what is almost identical in terms of pricing just over 40 grand to the tesla model 3 it's the ford mustang mac e a car i saw just over a year ago in la and i've talked to the engineers i've played around with it it was a prototype but i really really liked it i mean if it was out a year or so earlier than it actually is i have a standard range tesla model 3. i would have seriously looked at the most the mustang mackey which is basically the same price as the standard range model 3. if it was out when we bought that car and now of course it's the tesla model 3 standard rage plus arguably the best electric vehicle you can buy in the uk today not the cheapest granted 40 grand is a lot of money but tesla's have not only a bit of a cool factor for the younger generation anyway but they have a key advantage over every ev from every other manufacturer and that is of course the supercharger network don't get me wrong as an owner its build quality needs to change it really does now we have again a guesstimation but about 43 ish grand 260 apparently a real world range miles uh the volkswagen id4 effectively you know look we're into eurobox suv territory they're all going for suvs i'm not a fan of suvs i prefer a car an estate over an suv if you want something practical but that's what everybody wants stop buying suvs people now uh a lexus a full electric ux 300 e a car with the worst naming convention in the world but it's going to be impeccably built i'm sure it's a lexus after all probably uber reliable but for nearly 44 grand only 160 odd miles of range in the real world it's a bit bit much bit much so i'm not sure about that one i think if you lexus you know a lot of people are brand loyal at this so they might it but i just think the range given what is in that 40-yard grand price bracket is a little off yet another suv now the audi e-tron q4 45 is grand 230 odd miles of range yeah it's it's another photocopied audi suv it will be brilliant don't get me wrong audis are fantastic cars to just blow me to death unless they have an rs in front of it another mercedes now we have the mercedes eqb we've had the eqa this is the eqb and soon i'll be telling you about the eqc and of course the eqs 45 is grand 230 odd miles it's effectively a q4 equivalent but from mercedes again it'll be impeccably built very comfortable and luxurious and all that sort of stuff a car which we recently put on the just over christmas it's a pole star 2 not the pole star i was thinking of when i first heard about it but even then it is a very good car um it had its flaws again look at the in my if you want to know what i meant a bit more expensive at the moment for now anyway they are bringing out cheaper versions but 47 grand i wouldn't say you get more than 210 20 miles of range out of it a bit of a price jump now 59 grand nearly 200 miles of range 220 say in real world range it's the bmw ix3 it's a a very expensive bmw x3 i don't know why they've done it on that probably because everyone wants suvs yeah it's it's in their 60 grand bama wx3 i'm not sure if i'm going to be a fan of that just under 60 000 pounds now a car which was the last that went on the actually in plug-in hybrid form anyway the volvo xc40 electric i thought the fev the xc40 as a car anyway was fantastic as a family car i i thought it's brilliant i've still got it now because the cat pick it will put the lock down i've had it for nearly a month now and i don't know how long i'll have it for but i really can't fault it as a family car however in full electric version 170 ish miles of real world range just under 60 grand that's the stretch there it could be just out pricing itself now we move on to one of the most boring cars in its price bracket for me i'm sorry guys it's the audi e-tron i just think it's it starts at 61 and a bit grand it's a plain suv with electric impeccably built again really luxurious and comfortable i just i just there's nothing special about it and if i'm spending 60 grand i want something something unique it's another audi suv that's all i can think of now a car that's slated to coming out again this year 65-ish grand 250-ish miles will arrange the jaguar xj i hope this is as good as it should be and it does definitely come out i i jaguar i want them to do well and that moves us to the next car which is again a jaguar it's the eyepiece most people are very familiar with this by now starts at just over 65 000 pounds 223 miles of range it's had a few improvements recently uh i thought it was really good it felt a bit special the interior was nice although not the best in its class not the most practical quick very quick it just felt a bit i don't know it just had something felt a bit special felt a bit unique you felt that you were getting 65 grams worth of car if not maybe 65 grams worth of engineering now another car we're familiar with the mercedes eqc it's effectively just a petrol engine with batteries shoved in it and the petrol engine removed so i'm not a big fan of this if i'm being perfectly honest for 65 and a bit grand and all the way up 2210 miles of range i was at 210 miles of rear wheel range very luxurious really well built fantastic dash display it just had too many compromises for me mercedes could do better than that again watch the review in the if you want to know more now we have a car which i think is the best electric vehicle in terms of feel and just fun and handling and sportiness which i am usually a fan of over other genres the porsche thai can seventy thousand six hundred and ninety pounds it will start from they're bringing a cheaper rear wheel drive only version out uh i would say 200 ish miles of range-ish it's not the most efficient eva out there it just felt you were in something special and now it's a bit cheaper 70 grand we'll put this way would you want an eqc for 65 grand or a porsche tycoon for 70. although it should be said you're going to be spending at least 80 on a titan are you because everything's optional now we're shooting up to nearly 80 000 pounds it's the audi e-tron sportback it's effectively the same as the e-tron i mean from the middle forwards it's an e-tron i think it's literally identical although there are a few engineering changes with the sportback which make it more efficient from the back it's effectively a sportier suv so they've kind of taken an suv which is a practical car and made it less practical but it starts at 80 grand 230 miles of real world range apparently we'll see but i i just don't see it i just don't see the difference on what is basically the same as an e-tron i don't know it's a bit of a weird one it's another audi photocopier you know 50 shades of audi now we get onto a car which is well overdue a refresh and it's been out a long time it's the tesla model s shared under 80 000 pounds but you'll get well over 300 miles of real world range in that so you can't really beat it in terms of range of course you get the supercharger network as well and i should point out that as i am filming this right now there's a lot of noise on the uh the internet about the probable refresh coming out so that might be out by the time you see this the price might be different so it could be all changed now you never know what's going on with tesla another car that's on its way probably in this year is the bmw ix around 80 grand 300 miles of real world range apparently the ugliest front end of any car i've ever seen although i've not seen it in the flesh i just think it's a weird looking car and for 80 000 pounds you want some good looking really don't you the bmw ix is going to be an immensely engineered car i'm sure of that it's probably going to be brilliant as a car i just think it's locks are a bit well you're never going to put it on your wall are you nearing the end now still 80 grand 300 miles of real world range the mercedes eqs apparently maybe 350 miles of real world range although i'm a bit dubious on that one i'm not sure about this i think it will be again probably the bmw brilliantly engineered i just can't see the specialness there it's a car that you probably want to be driven in rather than a car to drive one criticism that people have of the next car the porsche tycoon is the practicality of it although it was pretty decent boot if i'm honest this is the porsche tycoon cross turismo which is effectively i think it was the estate version of the thai can starting at 85 grand 200 maybe 10 each miles of real world range i reckon so effectively it's a tie cam with a bigger boot now the car which if you want in more than five seats you're probably going to go for an ev world uh it's the tesla model x again it's got all the tesla benefits the supercharger network or pilot if again if you want that although it does have its faults believe me uh 88 grand just under 280 miles of real-world range only two cars left now so when you are starting at a hundred thousand pounds for this one it's an audi and it's the e-tron gt they are also doing an rs each on gt but this is the the cheaper version clearly uh effectively it's audi's take on the tai can it shares it's a lot of its chassis and components i believe i'm not really looked into it much but effectively they've taken the thai can and audi eyes it now the last car which i am dubious as to whether or not it actually will come out for delivery to anybody in 2021 but i thought i'd mention it anyway because it does look cool and if you looked at it in terms of how much you're paying in pound per mile of range you're paying 10 526 pounds per mile of range for this car it costs 2 million pounds and it's the lotus avaya hopefully it's as good as it looks it's a lotus i think they're gonna basically be putting all their eggs in one basket with this one so it could be fantastic it will handle brilliantly i'm sure of that i just hope it's built properly and i want lotus to succeed i want them to do well less than 200 miles of range for 2 million pounds but let's face it you're not buying it for range are you you're buying it for fun and immense speed we're pretty much done now i have done a lot of research on this one it's taken me bloody ages but hopefully i've got every car listed here if i've missed one put it in the comments and i will add it to the list in the description below so at least if you are looking at an ev in 2021 you've just got a massive list expand the description and they look they're all there and you can look at them and whatever's in your price bracket basically as i said earlier if you can the link in the description below or the pinned comment buy a ticket from botb they're more likely to come back and sponsor the so basically helping me out by trying to win a cat if you don't want to that's fine as well but that's that's the way i've gone down to fund this rather than ask for donations although i'm not saying i won't do that in the future um i will uh try and give you something for it in this case fifty thousand pounds in a car i mean you know can't say fairer than that can you right okay i think we're pretty much done here it's just a lots of talking and lots of lists and lots of pictures of cars but it always seems to be quite popular so fingers crossed this will be one will be as well do it really does help and then maybe fear will respond to me who not okay thanks for watching you,0
Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK3qIOtZKVv68oiQbgtv6AVK,sWWomUjWiKI,hello welcome back to the i'm evm and this is all about the used market for electric vehicles let's face it at the moment evs when the new are more expensive than their combustion engine counterparts not always is that true the new mini for example is a fraction cheaper than the petrol version it's based on so it is changing and the majority of manufacturers volkswagen included uh state that price parity will be achieved in roughly four or five years from now so it's not going to be forever but for now yes they are more expensive so the entry level ev is a used one and that's what i'm going to look at today i'm just going to look uh at well what we now nearly middle of march see what's on the used ev market and just see what you can get for between five and twenty thousand pounds at various increments now the ones i pick aren't necessarily going to be the ones i would definitely recommend you get at this price bracket you know for 10 grand go for this one i'm just picking interesting cars ones that i think are a decent price obviously everybody's different some need a family-sized car some just want a small commuter i'm just going to have a drink before i uh start this because it dries the throat out right let's start at the bottom end which is just over 5000 pounds for this particular one the reason i'm staying at five grand is because that's basically what used ev start at they've never been out long enough to have a really really bagging basement price bracket yet i mean we're looking at 2012 to 2014 when ev's first trickled in and even then you have the choice of a couple of ev so it's not mature yet right let's get on with this uh so for 5 200 pounds i found this renault zoe a 2015 one uh it's the 22 kilowatt hour battery and it has done just under 50 000 miles now this is a battery leased car which for those that don't know is effectively means that you get in the car for a few thousand pounds cheaper but you have to pay a rental effectively for the battery which is usually about well let's just say about 600 pounds a year okay so you're paying 600 quid a year for a batch release which means the battery is always under warranty which is usually what people worry about even though i wouldn't be um so it gives you that peace of mind you also get uh recovery as part of that so i guess you're saving a little bit there out of that 600 pounds depends on how long you're going to keep it if you're only going to keep it a year or two it makes sense to get a lease because you're saving two or three grand but you're spending 600. whether you'll get that at the end when you come sell it or not it probably ultimately evens out but it does people give people that peace of mind for the battery not that i think you need it however i think for that for just over five grand a car that still looks pretty much it does today that's all right i don't mind that at all it's what six years old now probably get about 70ish miles in the real world in that right now as it stands it's have to say obviously because there are many variables another one just to change it a little bit uh for a non-leased example for 5 258. this is a nissan leaf 63 register 2013 techno techno is the top spec so this is a family-sized car we had two of them over five years uh it really is a good family car we had absolutely no issues with it at all uh and for just over five grand you get in this one it's done eighty two thousand miles uh full mot full twelve bars on the battery healthometer which means that you've probably got about [music] 70ish again 70s miles of range on that one give or take five either side obviously it'll be more in summer less in winter um so i think they're not bad examples for just over five grand right let's move on uh jumping to eight grand now uh mainly because there's no point going six seven seven and a half whatever because ultimately i'll be just showing you newer versions of the cars i've just shown you there mainly because that's all that was available at the time that and uh teslas of course right this one is a 2017 so a four-year-old 41 kilowatt-hour renault zoe for eight grand i think that is a billy bargain it's done just under well just over 70 000 miles uh so it's done a lot of miles it's been used a fair bit it's four years old as i say and uh it's uh i would say 140 to 50 mile eevee in the real world it's a good range ev it has of course got a batch release which is why it's 8 000 pounds or not 12 or something that same thing applies basically uh yeah you'd be looking at 11 12 grand if you didn't have the battery lease the battery release for me is almost a pcp finance agreement you know you get in the car cheaper but you've got a monthly payment to go on top of it people often look at it and go well it's wiping out your fuel savings well it's not it's wiping out three or four thousand pounds on the list price in the first place so whichever way you balance it you're getting a four-year-old ev that does 140 50 miles i mean that will do 200 miles in summer my brother used to have one i know lots of people with them it's a 200 mile ev if you just even vaguely drive it economically when the weather's quite pleasant jumping up to just over 10 grand now for 10 and a half there's two examples on this one and again i'm picking different evs just to show you the range that is out there i'm not saying this is the one i would go for for 10 and a bit thousand pounds i just want to show you something that's not a zoe or relief still this is a 64 edge or 2014 bmw i3 just under 10 and a half as i said it's done just over 50 000 miles so yeah you're probably looking at again 78 miles it's hard to say it doesn't have the range extender on it probably why it's ten and a half thousand pounds and not several thousand thousand more and so this and the other evs i've shown you with the exception of the 40 kilowatt hour as always won't really work as an only car these are going to be partner cars out there where you've got more than one carrying your household it will end up doing most of the miles because it's so cheap to run and for commuting short journeys it's perfect the i3 has a carbon fiber chassis it's got unique looks it's got unique doors it's got unique interior and some it some don't it's not a big car but it's quick 170 horsepower and instant torque means that the knot to 30 time granted that's not brilliant but in in town is the not to 30 time of that is quicker than any other bmw including the m3 it really just flies the line it's a quick machine is that not top end or anything that but you know it's it's unique and let's face it if you stick a private reg on that no one will know how old it is and well your neighbors might think you just bought a new one or a nearly new one you know if you that sort of thing now moving on to something which again is quite unique and pretty rare uh in terms of you don't really see them on the road it's a 2016 66 wedge kia soul ev this one is loved by the people that own them it really is a quirky machine somewhat it ara can you look in our what would it be 90 miles real world range jumping up to 15 000 pounds now um otherwise again i'll be just showing you newer versions of what i've already shown you you know newer leafs newer zoes newer souls i3s and whatnot um this however i think is particularly good value because it's two and a half years old it will do about 135-ish miles in the real world it has done seventy thousand miles so it's had a lot of miles piled on it and it is a nissan leaf a 40 kilowatt-hour current shape techne technology is again the top specs you got all the toys on this one um and i think for something that is well in warranty in terms of the car warranty um and you've got another 30 000 miles left on the battery warranty and here comes the hill once more can never get away from the weather up here even when i'm inside a little bit more now 16 000 pounds just under another 2018 car so it's about three years old this is the hyundai ioniq or hyundai ioniq this again um the kia soil is a very efficient machine it's got roughly the same battery size again as the 30 kilowatt hour leaf but we'll do probably 10 15 20 miles more and it can charge up to 70 i think it is kilowatt uh yeah 70 kilowatts uh which means on a 50 you'll get a higher state of charge because most charges are still 50 kilowatt charges oh for god's sake real shut up it's got just under 50 000 miles and it's it's a big size car i think it makes a great taxi but in general it's just an efficient ev it's got a load of warranty on it i think they come with a seven year warranty to hyundai's as standard uh no eight years 125 000 mile warranty on the battery so there's a ton of warranty left on that which again i wouldn't worry but a lot of people worry about and should i should point out that when the warranty expires that doesn't mean that's when you place the batteries we just forget this new battery thing it doesn't exist people don't replace things when the warranty expires if you have a golf and the warranty expires after three years you don't buy new engine do you you just end up having to pay for any repairs which you won't need to on this because it has a huge warranty on it eight years hundred and twenty five thousand miles now nineteen thousand one hundred pounds i'm gonna call it 19 grand because you'll probably get that hundred quid off um it's pre-registered it's a 70 reg so effectively it's less than six months old it's an mg zs ev for 19 000 pounds it's only done 20 miles and it's the excite room which is the lower trim but effectively all the cars are the same in terms of battery size and performance and whatnot you'll get 130 540 miles out of this in the real world uh my brother has one he loves it uh i think they're very very good value the only thing i think i should mention with this is that i've seen these go for about a thousand pounds more brand new so i'm not sure if it's worth saving 900 quid for the sake of it being nearly six months old i'll probably pay that extra and just get a brand new one yeah i'm stuck with eve used tvs i can't show you the new ones because that wouldn't be a used ev market but i thought for 19 grand is practically well nearly new car isn't it and yeah very very well liked by the owners uh next let's look at a 20 and a half thousand pound car this is up to a year old i think it's about 10 months old and it's a renault zoe 50 which basically means it's the current model and you will get 230 miles out of that in summer probably more if you tried hard enough i would say 170 80 miles in the real world all you know year round if you just drive it normally and turn things on and whatnot again you the majority of the year that's a 200 mile ev 100 it's a very efficient ev you've got good range there's no battery release i should point that out so if twenty and a half thousand pounds uh it comes with the rapid charge option as well for the ccs i think that's a billy bargain so yeah that's all of the ones that i wanted to show you um that's on auto trader now but i did find one a few weeks ago i did put on my twitter feed which is at ev man uk it's probably worth following me on that if you want to know what's going on in the because i always post press cards i've got when they arrive on there but um this i thought was the bagging of the year bagging of the last few years to be perfectly honest with you let me just dig out the picture here we go found it right for 25 and a half grand give a take let's call it 26 just to round it up uh it comes with a 75 kilowatt battery four-wheel drive um lots of options i won't bother going through the wall but effectively it's a tesla model s for 26 000 pounds and it's a 2017 facelift model this i think is a billy baggy now you're thinking what's wrong with it it shouldn't be that cheap it's done i think it was around 175 000 miles which is a lot an awful lot but with those tesla model s i think it's up to 2020 you have an unlimited warranty on the battery and drive train in terms of mileage uh i think it's eight years so effectively that car has still got four years warranty left on the battery and drive train so it doesn't matter how many miles it's done even if you set aside 2 000 pounds for other repairs or you know things that you know door handles that goes wrong things that go wrong with tesla's 2 grand so it's 28 grand for a 2017 model s that's a bargain i mean i i would have seriously looked at that if i was in the market for a car mileage is irrelevant up to i think again i think it was 2020 when they stopped making it unlimited mileage um so yeah it doesn't really matter does it go for a four-year-old or a five-year-old six-year-old still under warranty and then i checked it out full mot from a trustworthy um trader that's been around for a lot of a long time and everything worked on it handles the you know the interfaces everything there was nothing faulty on it it was just the mindless that made it that price you just you can't argue with that value can you so sometimes these do creep up whilst we're on the subject of use dvds i wonder what my model 3 would be going for right now let's see how much they've depreciated i'm not sure i want to look at this so what is the cheapest tesla model 3 on the 20 player to standard range plus because i paid i think it was just over 40 000 pounds in terms of list price [music] there we go the very very cheapest one i could find on auto trader is 50 quid under 37 000 pounds that's done 22 000 miles which is slightly more than me so 37 grand roughly speaking so that means in one year my brand new car that everyone says you lose a third of its value as soon as you drive it away on as lost let's say 36 grand rather than 37 to play it safe four thousand pounds in a year i mean that don't get me wrong it's a lot of money but for a car that cost 40 000 pounds to be still worth 36 possibly more after a whole year and 20 000 miles i'm happy with that i mean let's face it how many people buy a car for a golf for 19 000 pounds that's worth 15 grand a year or so later strictly speaking that's cost you the same as a brand new tesla if i use my advanced man maths right hopefully that was useful to somebody it gives you just a brief overview and a little bit of a mixture of evs that are on the market for between five and twenty or thousand pounds um no real bargains anymore i think people cottoned on you get the odd one popping up the tesla but that was up for about a day and then it went um so i think if you if you're just patient enough keep an eye on the market and if someone calls comes up that you think oh that fits me go for it just go for it don't think well i'll look at it in a week or i'll wait until you know the weekend no no ring up go down now you've got to take your chance when it's there because otherwise someone else will snap it up okay i think i'm done thanks for watching any questions any ideas let me know in the comments uh have you got any bargains does anybody out there in the comment section bought a used electric vehicle and you're thinking i got a i got a good deal on that one has anybody anyone bought a used tesla model s and take advantage of that unlimited mileage warranty that you get with them and you've had you know what issues have you had have you had any because i think they're one of the uh sleepers almost on the used ev market people are going to look at the age the mileage especially the real high mileage and just ignore them because they're unaware of that warranty anyway i'm done thanks for watching see you soon,-1
Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK3qIOtZKVv68oiQbgtv6AVK,nE7yaiizxxA,hi guys now as we all know winter is coming winter is coming and winter is coming winter is coming winter is coming that's right winter is on its way and in this i'm going to show you what you need to do to your electric vehicle to prepare it for the winter months i'm also going to show you a few tips on how to negate some of the range losses that you inevitably get with colder weather so let's begin now the first place on star is under the bonnet this is a 12-volt battery very much you get in a normal cap it is responsible for all the electronics that this car has the lights the dashboard the alarm that does all of that if that isn't working the car will not start it will not work even if the traction battery is full it makes no difference that thing is key to everything so you need to make sure it's healthy if it's getting on a bit i bet it checked basically because without that yes stuck just so you know in v's the 12-volt battery is topped up by the main attraction battery when it gets to law the reason no alternator in an evie so as i said check itself and if you're unsure get someone else to do it for you it's also worth getting one of these boosters just in case you get caught shot because then you'd have to wait an hour or two or three or four for recovery to come again yeah if there is a problem with the 12-volt which if there is going to ever be one it will happen in winter the next thing i want to mention under here is the screen wash now this is slightly different from a normal petrol or diesel car because if the washer jets freeze up in a normal car the engine he eventually will defrost them basically typically when you get to your destination but ultimately there's a lot of heat waste heat coming from the engine and that will defrost the washer jets or whatever it is that is frozen in an evie of course you don't have that so it's very important to make sure the dilution ratio in your screen wash is it's very much set for lower temperatures than you would typically get in the uk i usually aim for - 15 - 20 just to be on the safe side because if it freezes up in an evie it's pretty much gonna stay frozen until the ambient temperature outside and guess above freezing and even then it can take hours so it's definitely worth making sure by it's top top just in case you're wondering i recommend this stuff pre stone screen wash it's also the auto express best by 2017 and i think 2018 it goes down to minus 25 and he cleans very well the last thing i'll mention while tsundere is oil or you'll get sticker as the temperature drops and in evey it doesn't matter because there isn't any to worry about now let's get this down and move on to the tires as we all know from school air expands when it gets warm and it contracts when it gets cold which means in winter the pressure will typically be lower than you set it to especially if you say in summer so that will run less efficiently check your tire pressures because even a 2 or 3 percent efficiency change can mean all the difference in al or ngv two or three miles for example in this leaf it could be all the difference between getting home and not and of course it's the safety aspect of it so check your tire pressures now in fact you should check it on a regular basis but let's face it most of us don't so it's worth doing before you get to winter muster on the subject of tires want to talk about the type of tire no of course winter and summer tires will be far better than an all season tire that pretty much is is quite obvious but believe me it makes a massive difference harry who's been in several of my videos had proper winter tires on his rear-wheel drive bmw and the un appeals that most four by fathers wouldn't even attempt it makes a massive difference and not just in the snore you should put winter tires on when it drops below seven degrees so if you've got somewhere to store your other tires and you can afford them it's definitely worth going for if you want to go for all season tires then i can highly recommend the michelin cross climate plus ones very highly rated have a look online in their reviews and they're also quite efficient very good in winter do wipers well the obvious if they're getting one replace them before we get to winter if they're alright give them a clean anywhere so at least you can see things through the next three months worth of rain which we inevitably will be getting now earlier i mentioned a couple of tips that can help you negate some of the losses that winter brings in terms of range in an e v because a normal car and evi is less efficient when it's cold it's not just the fact that you're using the heater a lot which affects range it's mainly due to the fact that the batteries themselves are so much colder and therefore less efficient so that is something we can do a little bit about in one of these tips but the first tip is something a lot of you're probably already used and that is the preheating basically you can use the app on your phone for most cars and start the heater going before you set off in the morning and if the carrier never typically plugged in which it usually is before you set off most of that energy from the preheat comes from the house rather than the car's battery so you save typically two to three miles on something a leaf by preheating in the morning whilst it's plugged in another massive bonus of the preheat is the fact that you don't have to scrape the car down as all your neighbors are going get in the ice off the windscreen all you have to do is basically pick up your phone as you're having breakfast press a button the carries warm it's the iced it's brilliant it's one of the biggest benefits of owning an electric car now not everyone has enough of the bobbin hyoeun by corner for example still doesn't have an app in the uk but the pretty much all do have a timer built into the cat so if you know it's time you setting off in the morning set the timer in the car so the heater comes on 15 20 minutes before you set off and then it'll be all nice and toasty for you now the second tip is a little bit fiddly but it can make a difference and that is basically when you charge the car so we all know that when you charge a car especially on a rapid charger it generates a lot of heat just ask anybody who owns a particular hour leaf now what i'm suggesting you do is basically use that heat in a more efficient better way when it's on or minus ten outside and the cars parked outside the battery it will be very cold so use the timer that is built into pretty much every electric car out there so it starts the charging of the car in the middle of the night you want to try name it so the cars on about 90 odd percent by the time you're setting off for work or wherever it is you're going in the morning that way all the heat that's generated by charging the car actually benefits the battery because this is bringing it up to a better temperature rather than it being minus five ten or whatever maybe outside so you can see where i'm goin in basically the habit is to try and figure out when the timer should start on the cat so he's a little bit fiddly and you may have to change it on an even daily basis but for the sake of the week or two weeks of the year where it's proper below freezing it is worth doing he does have a noticeable effect so for example if i add 20% on this car and i was setting off at 7:00 a.m. i would probably start charging about half past four and then by the time i self at 7 o'clock it should be in the early to mid 90s which should be modern enough for that day as driving and he will be still in the battery because the charger will be running at its fastest right up to the point before a set off so it's a little bit fiddly as i say but it can really help on the very very very cold mornings no doubt at this point someone will be so yeah y'all just get in my diesel car wear it after faff around with this range thing and you're right at the moment the lower range v's do have the range issue i'm not trying to mask that i'm trying to eke out the most out of the range we have so it doesn't become an issue so to recap tire pressures preheat the car charge it during the night i mean add all that together and you're probably looking at an extra 10 miles of range on something a 30 kilo our leaf that doesn't sound a lot but nearly everyone i spoke to a run out of electricity in an e v has done so within a mile of sort of their house or wherever it is the going you always run out just before you get to your destination because you think i think i can make it and then you don't so by doing these you probably will make it okay so we're done i would obviously recommend sticking the blanket in the cat and a snow shovel just in case and hopefully that has been useful to at least two or even three people a lot of what i've said you will probably go well dirt because it is quite obvious stuff well not everybody is aware of that so i thought it was worth doing a just for that reason now if you've got any ideas or things that you do which help feel free to share them in the comments below because then we can all benefit from them as always thank you for watching i've got videos about v's in my if you've not seen anything so the button have a look of what i've got in there and as always thank you for watching i will see you soon,1
Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK3qIOtZKVv68oiQbgtv6AVK,UPX0R5O3h3E,"hi guys now tomorrow i'll be doing a long journey in a short range electric vehicle i'll be doing it in my 30 kow nissan leaf which is about what 90 to 100 mile range which by today's standards is now a short range car and the journey itself will be about 600 mil i'll just plunk the camera down right i'll be starting off around here in north yorkshire going all the way down here past mid ke and then all the way across there past ip switch this is to pick things up and then all all the way back up to north yorkshire to drop some things off and then finally i get home so is it possible to do a 600 mile journey in a 900 m range ev in subzero temperatures within amber snow warning i guess there's one way to find out right let's get off it's early o00 it's aboutus 5 what am i doing really okay stopped snowing so that's a good thing uh but i want to make very clear at the beginning of this i am not doing this in some attempt to try and persuade people that a short range ev this is suitable for replacing your ice on long journeys and things that it clearly isn't anywhere near as good on a long journey or as convenient than uh than a petrol or a diesel car that's not the purpose of this the purpose of this is well i'm doing the journey anyway so i thought i might as well film it but some people do just have a leaf or a lot of people who have uh well a short range ev not necessarily a leaf have another car in the household myself lucky enough to have two cars oh shut up satn so if you're one of those that you know has a short range ev and usually take the other car out you do have the option if you want of taking this now i wouldn't be doing this journey if i wasn't in an ev right now now whilst we're on the subject of a normal carat i could of course have taken the mini it' have been a lot more convenient certainly but it have meant if i had taken the mini this journey would have been kind of pointless i'm only doing it because i have this electric car that is the only reason i'm doing this journey let me clarify what i mean by that i am basically going down to mil and ke to pick up ironically uh a john cooper works mini exhaust because it'll pop and bang more and i'm a child from there i'm going down to ip switch or past ip switch to a company to pick up a load of garage flooring that is £ 1220 cheaper for me to pick up than it is get it delivered to my house so i thought well if i drive down in the mini the cost of petrol would be at least £70 and it means it's kind of pointless in doing the journey it wouldn't make any sense in this however at most it should cost me20 so i'm £100 better off by taking this over the mini that's the whole reason of doing this journey to save myself money on the flooring to pick up the exhaust which is collection only um so i'd have had to do a journey anyway and i can also see my mom and dad who live nearish itp switch as well so cobble that all together and that's why i'm doing the journey but basically if i'd have taken the mini financially at least it' have been kind of pointless so it does give you other options does an e yes of course that i would have loved to have been in a much longer range electric car i mean 600 miles if i'd have been in a tesla model 3 or a hyundai corner or a kia nero i could have done this journey with stopping if i were careful enough just once but realistically twice and that kind of leads me to another point that people always mention that they don't want an ev unless you can do 600 miles in one charge that is ridiculously long it's unnecessary in the uk at least because today's journey 600 m according to google maps in a normal car is going to take me 10 hours i'm sorry but if you're going to do a 10-hour journey without stopping you're an idiot and borderline dangerous there's a very good reason why truck drivers every several hours have to by law have a break because it would be stupid to drive that long continuously especially on mot and things that you just you wouldn't do it so if you had a 350 mile let's say proper real world motorway range ev you could do a 600 mile journey and you wouldn't stop anymore than you would do in a normal car so you see where i'm going here it's the person that's the limitation on a long journey realistically than the car that's why i think i'll say 400 mil is a sweet spot of an ev in the uk at least anyway right well i'm going to settle in and report back when i've got something to report back about the snow is on the ground but i think we're doing okay for now so i'll see you a bit uh i'm going to stop at wood all services i think because i've just realized the kind of little plan i made yesterday on using zap map and all that so you know i'll stop here i'll stop here i'll stop here i've left that at home so i'm going to have to wing it and here we are at our first stop wood all services nearly 70 mil uh got 33% left so i'm going to top up to 80% because once you get a fair bit past 80% you end up the well the charge speed tapers off so there's no point charging beyond 80% on multiple stop journeys anyway because the charge rate slows down and therefore you're just wasting time it'd be better for me to stop charging 80% move on and then start charging again up to 80% and so forth so you're getting the most efficient speed of charge if you uh out of it all now where are the charges i need a pee i need a pee i should have gotten at the last up i don't know if it's the cold weather or what i'm 6 and a half mil away from the next stop at least the snow stopped at least in this part of the country anyway uh and it is getting warmer still we're at minus 3 now so so yeah it's uh it's practically tropical okay i'm here at my first polar ultra charger of the journey and to be honest most of the charges that i think i'll end up doing will be on the polar network not the electric highway not at the services electricity stuff so i i find it a lot better to be honest uh you got a hotel which is typically nicer than some services and uh the ultra chargers are a lot easy to use you have to tit about with an app so uh right let's get going right well i've uh planned for this journey y y i really planned for it i uh sto in off a holiday in another ultra charger and there a really nice cafe lots of uh you know tea coffee if you that sort of thing and cakes and donuts and stuff that i had to stop myself from uh from from just pigging out on these sort of things oh yeah good scotch egg next up is to pick up the exhaust and uh then on to whip switch well as you can see i've got the exhaust now uh and i've uh pway towards the the ip switch leg to pick up loads of garage flooring which should be interesting in fitting it in i have six bars on the battery temperature i've done about 260 miles so far so to be honest it's been faultless i've been stopping and i've i've even been writing it down in in my daughter's little notebook here uh so i've done a 25 minute charge 20 minutes 20 minutes it's 15 minutes this is probably going to be another 15 minutes so yeah i i actually quite driving about an hour an hour and a half and then having to stop it's very relaxing you get to stretch your legs uh you get to go and have a pee um and uh yeah so far so good hopefully it'll carry on this and uh i'll get home on in in good time right i think it's pee time again well bit of a time jump uh it's uh nearly tea time and i've collected all the garage flooring as you can see the exhaust is in there too so there's a there's a lot of weight in the back now which is going to be really fun for the uh journey home i'm probably about 20 20 m away oh probably worth mentioning uh something called glimpse it's an app that you can put on your phone and it basically allows people to see exactly where you are and track your journey um so anyone that follows me on twitter will potentially be following this journey live as it happens now uh my twitter feed is @ evman uk so if you want to follow me on that then by all means because sometimes i do this sort of thing uh and half of it doesn't end up on the so uh give that a shot the uh batteries are still on six it went to seven but it's dropped back down again so i really don't think temperature will be a problem at all probably in part due to the uh ambient temperature outside right now it's 2° but as it's getting dark as you can tell it's probably going to get colder as the night progresses uh so i don't think this will be a problem at all in summer it probably would be but i guess that's for another oh i've been sat down for far too long oh yes and my scotch eggs i dropped a bit of the egg down there and i can't get to it especially with all that behind me so now the car smells i farted 5,000 times uh so yeah that's pleasant haven't got the uh microphone on so you have to excuse the bad audio but i have 11% on the battery i'm 11 m from the charger and it's heavily snowing where it affects the range more than i thought it would and i got cocky and thought no i'll go for the next charger so now i'm kind of wetting myself 10.6 miles i think it said and i have 11% off well i'm stuck here for about half an hour cuz i'm so low on battery i managed to get it thank christ that was that was close um look at this some pratt let's the emergency stop right uh work work work work work start charging free vend i don't know if that's a good or a bad thing that's the uh car park there's hardly hardly anyone here because i'm not stupid enough to be driving in this come on now relying on you okay we're charging i'm going to go get a drink because uh i've ran out a while back as well snowing quite heavily now in fact i'm going to have a look on my cctv to see what it's doing at home because if it's doing this all the way back and i'm still probably 100 miles away it snowed at home as well okay hopefully well i've managed to get to donc cter i'm at the holiday in uh and the snow's coming down a lot now but i'm here to charge not to stay hopefully i'm not uh tempting fake when i say that this is the last charge go on not e doing that with one hand this is the last charge uh uh of the entire trip so fingers crossed the snow will ease up it keeps stopping and starting uh but i tell you this charger is right around the back of the bloody hotel why can i put signs on i mean what been driving around for 2 minutes right well i put my foot down for the last uh leg to to this bit because i know temperature won't be a problem so uh i'll be doing the same on the way home and how far am i from home that's a good point actually 58 mil so i'll probably go to 80% maybe 85 so i can just put my foot down a bit more it's half n now i've been ono as it work haven't been driving the whole time obviously for 15 and 1 half hours i still feel really alert and i don't know why maybe it's because i'm stopping every 1 to two hours maybe it just keeps you fresher maybe i'm just going to crash as soon as i get home there's someone in this hotel right now maybe on cctv watching me thinking who the hell is he talking to that smell that egg's getting smellier yeah i i think again i think it's safe to say that it's been a successful trip i've done the calculations if i take out the the amount of time i was you know talking to the guy with the exhaust and loading this up and talking to him that sort of stuff arakan given the level of traffic which dictated the the speed i had to go to for a massive portion of that and then the weather i think it's probably about three and a half hours longer than if i'd have taken a normal car so 3 and a half hours extra in a short range ev if i were in a modern e uh you know the kia kia ino what they call then the hyi corner or even a tesla of course then you're probably looking at maybe half an hour more than a normal car up to an hour so we're not far off really in terms of long journeys being as quick as a petrol car yeah i don't want to stop as much as i've had to do in this of course but especially if you got kids anyone with kids will know exactly what i'm about you're not going to be doing a 10hour plus journey without stopping even if i i think 3 or 4 hours is the most you usually need a pee by then or or something else you need something to eat perhaps straight your legs my back is killing me um or rather it will do when i stand up uh and you with kids you're going to have to get out so i think that's why that's sweet spot as i said earlier it's about 350 to 400 miles 350 real world motorway miles should be more than enough for anyone right done it home yes grab the things once again i pushed it a little bit i kind of got a little bit cocky once more and this is what i've ended up arriving home on so this is what i've arrived home because oh i've got plenty i'll put my foot down dash dash dash with dash dash so i've got home with three maybe 4% i'm glad i could uh i could help anybody who's thinking about getting an ev by wasting their time completely with this if you want to waste any more of your time then the button and uh look at all the other videos in the uh i think i've gone little bit strange we've been in this car since 6:00 a.m. and is now half past 11 anyway as i said thank you for watching uh i apologize for everything you've just seen uh my normal standard of is this basically so yeah the button if you want to see more awesome videos seriously guys thank you for watching and i'll see you soon bye",4
Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK3qIOtZKVv68oiQbgtv6AVK,uju2-IYYBwU,"hi guys i'm evm and welcome back now over the last three or four years we've own two evs and i think it's been uh a very positive experience for me it set out to to do what i wanted it to do save money uh and i would view the inconvenience of an e into a challenge but what does somebody who doesn't really care about cars let loan electric ones think about an ev what would someone who's owned one for the last three or four years actually tell someone else about what it's been to own about because obviously i'm kind of biased and people do accuse me of that but hopefully you're not so i thought the best thing to do is to ask the most beautiful woman in the world what it's been to own an ev for the last few years unfortunately she's av she's not available no nerd damn you you knew what i was going to say before i said it didn't you yeah setting that up for weeks so basically what would somebody who's owned one for three or four years who doesn't cars in general tell you about in them is it been a good positive or a negative experience or somewhere in between let's find out nearly four years ago i came to you cuz we were getting a new car and said right what about this one and i remember you saying well it looks all right but i'd to see it in in the flesh and then i told you it was an electric car yeah no fuel no petrol no we have to charge it at home so what what did you think when i said cuz four years ago remember very different sort of situation did you even have you even heard of one before nope no i can safely say i had never heard of an eevee electric vehicle anything that and my first reaction was okay that sounds a bit strange not sure what i think of that nissan did a 4- day trial for the car you know no cost trial uh which they don't do anymore which is a bit of the pain i think was that key do you think to to proving that we could manage with an ev because you took it to work i took it to work and it kind of it giv us the proof that we could actually manage we have two cars obviously so we had a we had the plan b yeah um but did that 4 day thing make i think i think it definitely made a difference i mean i wouldn't have gone for the ev if we didn't have a petrol car as well because i always wanted the petrol one as the as the the standby car the one that i was used to so to speak but yes getting the chance to drive it to work and thinking actually this is okay knowing i didn't have to worry about charging or anything that at that point i basically just took it to work brought it back from work it was a nice car to drive bear in mind that that was the previous lea so that had probably 70 80 miles range oh yeah it's made a huge difference now we've got more yeah and we we're slightly different to most people because i come home from work certainly back then you go to work so we work at different times so the car is used for both both of us comm wise so when i come home it's on anywhere from 70% to 40% and i'm quite strict in the sense now i say it's got to be on at least 54% 55% because i don't doing the journey to work where i'm constantly looking at it all the time the percentage and i went to watch it although i have to say done a couple of journeys where i've managed to get there in 14% and i've felt quite proud of myself that i've got there in so that's i mean you you wanton it's about 45% minimum bare minimum don't you 50 four really all right 50 oddd bare minimum yeah even though you know you can do it on probably 30 if you need it to so what what this is what i find lot people don't getting into the red as it were in a in a pet it's a petrol i don't when it drops to quarter i start getting a bit ansy don't i i want to make sure only got 200 mile range i better put some yeah i i want to make sure that you know i'm going to a petrol station in the next at least journey or so because i don't seeing it so that would you mention that to somebody else was thinking about getting one you say you're going to have to get used to arriving home on 10% or yeah and i think i have done now yes i know that it's all right to get home when it's on sort of eight or nine% if it starts getting lower than that then i'm i'm not very happy so you've had to get used to getting back on low percentage but does it get easier i mean you know if you've got 10% and you're two miles away from home there's not a chance you're going to run out but do you still get a bit of range anxxiety do i do i say yeah yeah i'd say that it's probably not as bad as it used to be but no there there's still that feeling thinking right am i okay going along the bypass or should i go along the local road which isn't going to use as much percentage and then i think no actually i'm probably am all right going along the bypass but i do find that if i set off to work and it's anything lower than 60 then i am watching the percentage even though you know even though i know it's you could put your foot down the whole way there the way back okay i'm still i'm still watching the percentage so you can't quite get around that no i to know that when i'm setting off from work when i finish my shift it's at least 35 sometimes i have the second half of the battery cuz you were occasionally work nights so i it's you that ar home and i have to set from 56% i've gone out with less than i would realistically want and i would view that as a a challenge all i wonder if i'm going to do this no problem i know there's charges to hop onto if it comes to it but you wouldn't do that and of course because you're always working in the evening or at night you're not going to use the public charging infrastructure what little we have to use because well who wants to go in the center of bradford at midnight to charge the car it's not going to happen so i guess range is still is that the only difference between this car and a petrol car range is that is literally the only difference in terms of what you're worry about it's the the range and then that comes into the charging as well if i'm by myself and i have to charge because i don't think charging is very easy i mean i know there's a few more charge points that are appearing now in supermarkets and things that and various establishments aur and what have you you don't you don't charge do you no that's what i was going to say i i don't charge and the thing is i know that in the boot of the car we've got the the little all the the um the three pin plug adapter and the normal thing as well yeah we've got everything in it we've got can't get the right word but we've got we've got the plugy thing plug-in thing yeah we've got we've got those that are in the the boot of the car and i should easily be able to put them them into where they they need to go but you need to get you need to get it into its hole yeah get it into the right slot i'm not going down that rit at all is it doesn't sometimes it seems a bit daunting which might sound silly to you we've on nearly four years yes but i've never actually used any of those ones that are in the boot of the car they're always wrapped up in there so case in point then uh in what in two days you're going to your mom and dad's which is about 64 miles each way so you can't realistically do it on a full charge unless you really really try so basically you have to charge at least once not for long and on a rapid charger 15 minutes would be enough but as usual you won't take the leaf which has got about 110 mile range you won't take the leaf even though there is a rapid charger almost at the end of the road of your m and dad so it's very easy you literally pass it well it's 5 to 10 minutes away yeah but you pass it don't you're on the way yes so there's no detour needed other than pulling in and plugging in that's it for maybe 50 minutes you will still be taking in two days the other car rather than the lea yeah it it's partly because it's not very easy when i get to mom and dad's for doing the the charging they're always worried about leaving windows open and things that and they don't have a charge point home across yeah exactly there is obviously the other one but generally i'm trying to get there if for a particular time and i don't want to think about having to add that onto my journey i just want to know that i can get to mom and dad's that the car is there it's parked for the whole time that i'm at mom and dad's and then all i need to worry about is getting back in the car to go home and i know that as long as i filled up with petrol and i always make sure i've got three qus time a full tank when i go that that so even though it's only a 15minute detour 20 minutes i mean i did do it that time but the thing is it's not very easy to do it because you know you have to have your phone you've got to go into the right it's the electric highway charges by the way so the electricity they're not they are are not usable friendly at all and you've agreed with me on this one always having to go into that app or you ring this person up and if there's no answer on the phone and you stuck by yourself and i just so even if i mean there's three rapid charges there we've never had an issue it's you know three that we can use lots of fear loses if you want even if you could guarantee them working you still wouldn't take it would it you wouldn't probably not even though it's about 20 we've had this so if i have to openly admit that yeah i would still choose the mini so even though 20 20 25 cheaper to take the leaf other than me you would still take that and is it just because you have to pull off or because yeah it is the extra hassle if if we had a car that had that higher mileage i'd be taking it so if the leaf had a 200 mile range you would have no issues i i don't think so i don't think so i mean i enjoy driving the mini i do i do driving the mini as well but the leaf i have no issue with taking to work and i the fact that i can just get in the car and we don't have to worry about petrol and you know just drive it and then get it back plug it in i have no issue with plugging it in when we're at home here it's just that when it comes to having to take a cord out of the car it's that extra bit of effort and thinking we would have to do that near your dad's well no i wouldn't have to do that cuz that's all there for you although i put it in the wrong hole first time i went there didn't i but ccs doesn't fit in a n on leaf unfortunately right i've just noticed something hang on a minute excuse me how muches got to be pretty for youtube right we okay to carry on now no idea thank you no idea what that was about talk about being natural we got to be beautified for youtube so basically the car isn't the problem the charging sorry the public charging and how it's done is the m is the only reason you don't take it if you could go there and charge at your mom and dad's using a proper charge we have in ours yeah if they had an electric car you could just borrow theirs yes you'd have no issues it's so it's literally the public charging infrastructure which is causing you to take the other car yes i suppose it is becauseit laziness well yeah so the inconvenience fact even though it's not that bad it's so no more inconvenient going to petrol station it's it's that worry that in this case the thing is the thing is i say with that when i take the mini i will always make sure that there's at least three quarters of a tank if not a full tank of petrol because i don't particularly want to call in it a petrol station i want to know that i can do my journey there and i can do my journey back but you will go to a petrol station specifically tomorrow to fill up fill only to then come home and set off the next day so that's not inconvenient but the charging is no which is on route no i know but then i'm on my journey if it's pre-journey to me that's just getting ready for the journey it's once i'm on the journey that i want to know it's simple would you say the driving driving the actual car is easier lovely easier or the same or no difference it's great and i the fact that you know all i do is i stick it in part mode or i stick it in drive mode or reverse mode i love that when i i get to a traffic light i can go into the ne you know say that there's three lanes i go into the second lane there's someone next to me and i know for a fact i'm going to be off before them are you traffic ron pr in bradford how dangerous that is right so so ultimately it's all down to the range yes is that is that basically that that is primarily the the thing and and i wait for the point when the the mileage increases and we can go off on i mean if we could go down to to clon to to to m and dad for example and we could do that in one drive that would be incredible that's 260 m journey we have a tesla model 3 on res reservation just over three years now we're probably up to a year away from getting it maybe soon who knows that should do the one we're looking at anyway at least 220 miles in the real world which means we'd have to stop once going down m and dad's you wouldn't have to stop at all going to your mom and dads yeah um but on a five to six hour journey we would be stopping anyway w we oh yeah well you would you drive down to my mo dad's in the tesla be in mind you're going to have to stop anywhere and with a tesla you just plug in there's no app nothing you just literally get the cable plug it in and walk away would that you know if you were for whatever reason going that my mom dad's by yourself possibly setting aside my issue with roundabouts and things that then yes that'ss in any c i know but i'm just saying i wouldn't want to do the journey down to as it is roundabouts you don't well all right if you can find a route that doesn't evolve roundabouts btet to get to m and dads you have to go you take you got back car or you know which car would you take if we had the tesla or the mini you're going to stop with alice in the car anyway yeah it's about the same size it's just thinking when it comes to parking spaces i'm quite happy reversing into a space when it comes to you know asda super market and any other place that i go to in a you're not helping the cliche of women here really i don't roundabouts and i don't parking listen i just said i reverse parking into a space how many women will just drive forward in and then spend a trying to f about rever all you have to do is reverse pking to a tesla basically it's plug and play yeah you're sto in anywhere so you have to park at the services would the extra p bit of plugging in get rid of that range anxiety or the fact that you have to plug because it's is so easy it's literally plug and play no app no cards yeah i would want you to be with me when i did it the first couple of times but ultimately yes ultimately it would be much much easier rather than having to about and find an app and also there's loads of charge points there ar there for tesla oh yeah yeah you'd have to so you know it's going to work yes you almost know that it's pretty much always going to be available there's got lots of to choose from and it's simple to use so again we're down to the charging infrastructure the electric highway i've said this rages the app that they force people to use to charge the car ultimately puts people are getting in electric car and you're kind of saying that aren you you don't use their network by itself because it's such a faf it is and i i wish they'd just listen to the feedback and do something about it so would you view the last three four years in the leaf in the electric car as a positive a negative or somewhere in between you if you if class this as an experiment would you say it's a successful one or there still some things that you you know i think overall yes a positive experiment because it's obviously going to be better for the environment isn't it you're not having to go and pay money for petrol all the time it does save us a ton of money doesn't yeah i'm sure it does and just being able to go to work and back and just switch the just switch the drivers effectively is is economical but there are those couple of points that just make me hesitate in picking up those keys every time rather than the mini keys i guess no it's uh it's a perception in it and that's kind of what this is trying to say out there because most of the people i speak to are blow let's face it and they go i want an eevee i think i'm sure it will work for us but now i'm trying to persuade my other half whether it's female or male that it's a good idea and you try to persuade someone who doesn't care about cars let alone electric ones that it's a good idea to make it different for what they've been used to for for many many years yeah so you're basically saying that it's a car charging i mean this is something i guess we've got used to but you just plug in home charging at home i say is no but we've had to not go to the petrol station many many times so surely not visiting the petrol station a lot made a big difference we've not really noticed that have we but that has got to be a good on the convenience side so i guess it's a it's a compromise at the moment but hopefully when mr tesla eventually turns up it'll be far less it will wipe out almost all of your issues yeah [music] i'll be back in a second someone's at the door well i don't know if you were but we've actually done about 65,000 miles in an electric car well we're on 44 yeah yeah so if you if you had the previous one to this one about 60 odd, miles we've done in an ev and i've probably done about 20 of them there yeah maybe the leaf has just needed four new tires uh and because of that i took the mini for the for three days straight to work which has been great fun i love driving the thing but i had to put petrol in twice 20 quid each time cu oh 20 quid will do i'm so i've got so not used to putting petrol in and and judging how much i need it's always i got spent 440 on petrol and normally it's it's literally that would be two or three yeah um off the electric bill so it's uh yeah i think going back to a petrol only would be very odd i mean if for whatever reason i said you know what let's get rid of the leaf and get a normal car again what would you say that would be surprised yeah i would i would probably be questioning why you were why you were going to do that and saying actually i've got used to having an electric car i quite it children and the next generation so to speak in alice's case she probably can't really remember not having an electric car because she was only about three three or four we got it yeah people just need to sometimes take the the leap but i i suppose it goes back to that n and lef thing the four- day test drive that again they don't offer anymore was key to us doing that we might not have got one had it not being for that so stopping that when people are so unsure about what it's to live with i think is a big mistake for every manufacturer so someone sat there right now mhm as we are a couple say one is for an ev one just don't care about cars mh would you tell that person now to try it or go for it or not yet i know every every situation is different so it's impossible to be specific but you don't regret it do you i guess yeah but we've had that plan b a backup c i tell yeah i tell them to give it a go but i would say not to give up your petrol car straight away if it's an option to have two cars then yes try out the electric even if it's a 300 mile range if they're getting a tesla would would that would that change the single car maybe but then you've still got to get that goes back to the four- day trial thing doesn't it i think you need if you're going to just buy that electric car and that's the only car that you're going to have then i think you need chance to try out beforehand just to see what you think i don't think you'd regret it i've got to look at that that's the camera i'm but clashing cuz they're both black yeah is that problem i don't know is it if people are more bothered about whether or not we're wearing the same color oh you'd be surprised how fickle you you sh comm",1
Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK3qIOtZKVv68oiQbgtv6AVK,-djLiWp9CCs,now guys now if you're anything i was before i went for levy you get to the stage where you've done your research you think yeah mileage off-road parking i've got that all sorted i think i can definitely make it work especially if you've got another carrying household so it doesn't ultimately matter but then you hit a bit of a pause because you don't really know what it's to live with on a day-to-day basis and sometimes that's the most important thing now it's very difficult to get across to people what it's on a day to day basis other than saying it's just a car ultimately i think you're plugging at home so i thought let's do a about it this is basically a week in the life of an eevee and yes it's as exciting as it sounds although i have included such gems as this what you do who wouldn't want to see me singing on camera battle lord should be enough to make you wonder watch this now remember guys i've got over 100 videos in my so if you have got any questions about v's i've probably already done a about it so the button and enjoy this enthralling okay monday morning early too early i start the week fine i stick that on the windscreen to show you there so now i'm sent monday morning 33 thousandths of a mile so let's see what i've done by the end of the week oh no it's cold however will i survive i put in the heater on in the electric carriage juice is my range so much now don't worry it's not gonna be a basically about me going to work and my wife is just gonna be a quick overview the reason why i'm showing each day is because you have to prove everything on youtube but always people don't believe you right my breakfast breadstick it'll happen if you film a youtube in the morning instead of breakfast yeah nutritious people have this impression that you have to have everything off on an eevee without severely reducing your binge and it's just not the case so this might seem mundane stuff but everything right now is on the rear window to mist it because it's misty dope he's on the heaters on my lights are still on even though they're set to automatic the bluetooth sardar basically everything he's on right now and he doesn't make a difference i'm not driving in eco mode either i mean normal not eco mode whatever whether you call it now i don't have a typical commute i go for two at least two places a day and there could be quite different in fact i could randomly get sent to the other side of leans potentially and to 2030s my wife will be using the car after i get home so two people use this car for commuting need to make sure all songs are pick a cool ones especially if they're on camera why do people do that i'm at the merging turn b and then when you just get to the start of this merging turn b people indicate left and just stop we're into turning just merging turn come on bob what do you want an invitation are you welcome dance me a dance joannie a joke and love the clouds away all right i mean 20 miles later don't worry i won't be doing this feeding entire week i'll be saying i've done x miles then x miles the next miles and miles i'll just kind of do today and then skim through the rest so you can kind of get an idea what it's for the full commute in an eevee guide do something just even videos die even amaze myself sometimes what people do ask these though they are curious as to what is did toward one and this is the best way i can think to short people right done next here me here today right got 50 percent left on the battery i've done 24 miles so far and according to there's only a few master the next one and then in theory after that could go home now i can enjoy new traffic laden lords of bradford to drive all the way at home back to nice sunny north yorkshire hopefully we are home again all right i've done about five six and a half miles cat is still on 29% and remember i start off with what eighty percent or something that about everything on i'm nice and comfortable about lots of eating all that sauce stuff so no problems at all this time tomorrow i'll be getting out the cash she'll be getting in going straight to work cuz we work at different times well this is where most of our mileage comes from the fact that we both use it for getting to work and back suppose matters will include this angeles task of plugging the car in look i have to lift this flap up here grab this and then plug the karen whoa takes a lot of my time another dawn of the day one thing that's never really mentioned with the eevee's actually there's a big bonus is how quickly the heater starts pumping out heat of course you're after work the engine to eat ought to generate that heat pump into the cabin so he i would say within wind less than a minute of turning the car on off turn the heater on anyway [music] anybody else get fed up with the same stuff for lunch i mean i have to cannery in the car typically it's very rare i have access to a microwave or even to be able to sit down on a table but no i'm just fed up with sandwiches in the same old same old post in the comments and the ideas of nice lunches that are easy to make and just different a sandwich just passed a year boiler seven kilowatt hour charge post i don't need to use it of course but sometimes if for every reason i needed to use it backed up there only for twenty minutes or so on probably give you about 90% of something 10% after 2025 minutes to put - sometimes that's all you need oh here we are again now the difference today is that the missus is going to work in about two minutes i'll just leave the care i'm to be honest - do 80 miles have done so far this week cows on 69% should be more than enough for the missus that's nice chocolate in the seat what that's bed crumbs i have just got home i should have said before it was 148 when i set off it's now - 18 and i was just right i think i said 25 to 30 percent and there's 29 percent okay night-night cows on a trip set of course it's plugged in all night as usual for during the week mon will be working tonight again sir always just leaving plugged in overnight when it's cheap to charge at night um but for the grid as well it should be a relatively easy a deer for the car anywhere today because i'm in the office which is still about 10 12 miles each way book that's fairly straightforward [music] well change of plan emergency visit i'm off to the other side of bradford yay so yes this is the thing with the with my days it could be a short commute if you're liking could be a very long one i don't know so will he be cook at least tvs are brilliant for traffic you know you're not wasting anything just sat here off you know it's not it's not just sucking traffic that i found a nice when you just creeping forward especially if you've got a manual gearbox you know go forward a bit you start you've got a fold of it you start and you just keep going and going that they have just driven an hour over an hour cat made 19 20 miles to turn something on because it was off oh we can't you see he's not working i've literally gone there and pressed the button so stop to finish top three next and then they'll be stopped for then i'll be going home then my wife are going to work and going home so today is it a big one for mr. leaf in commuting turns but it will be fine no problems at all this entire day will be costing isms in fuel terms anyway about one pound fifty at most if i did the lesson about one pound 20 this gets charged at night and for me that's five people kill or what hours because it's a time of day tariff so one pound of the day i'm doing anywhere from sixty two that's why i mean an eevee it's not for any ecological reasons although for that into financial reasons i save a ton of money by driving around and commuting in this okay end of wednesday for me start wednesday for the missus cows on 58% 163 miles so far this week getting the wrong side we see him they say yes i've been organized and putting my stuff and singh is this somebody obstructing and i think that way i'm not doing a very influential due to piece to camera interrupting yes well that's what happens you have to be able to react appropriately we are thursday morning they cast on 200 miles pretty much exactly and of course another hundred percent for today one is working again tonight so of course it's gonna be on 100% but my mileage today should be it's gonna be quite minimal huracan maybe 30 miles if that really so i guess it doesn't need to be on 100% book and it's 226 now i am tired gonna charge the car and go inside and go to sleep because that right now is all i need okay bye-bye yes the weekend oh the inconvenience having to a blow up my car again five seconds of walk it back let's get off 254 miles done so far this week and today is probably gonna be another 40 odds lana's not going back to work today so in theory it's just today and whatever we do over the weekend which is probably just town and back or whatnot which would be another 20 30 miles doing anything else in particular have to excuse the noise but it's bloody freezing so that heat is working overtime to get the car nice and warm because i didn't use the app for those that don't know basically you get your phone out you press the button on it and the cap preheats itself to whatever temperature you want it you say it evasive but in winter this is a godsend because you never have to scrape the car down you never get into a cult car and as it's plugged into the house when you're doing the preheat it only uses a little bit of energy so it's permanent [music] there's pros and cons now even as i've said eve eat are quite there yet for them for the majority of people well it won't be long i get there and think about it just five years ago even used to be in to buy a car and evie that does 60 70 miles on average now for the same price you get in a car that could do hundred and 450 miles on average so pretty much doubled the range the same price the day you can walk into a ford dealership and get a ford fiesta electric that's the same prices are for yes the petrol and similar range is the dead people will naturally choose to get an eevee [music] i'm home it's friday finished yes the weekend right okay so the care is done there is damnit two hundred and ninety miles in fact let me pull this out there we got the cows done two hundred eighty nine point one miles that's monday to friday serve that's basically a typical week for us and i would say that's longer than most people's commute certainly so this isn't to say look evie's a better commuting certainly cheaper but my point is if an eevee suits you you know for example you've got two cars in your household there's no problem getting with the community this is just a normal day-to-day thing and if you are kind of humming an hour in about getting an eevee hopefully this will help you in somewhere and mister warrix to live with it might not be the most exciting i will freely admit that one it's basically me going to work and back in and my wife as well volta mentally it's easy you know i'm spending what five maybe ten seconds plug in the car in at night and plug in e in the morning right so this week in the cabinet was fifty miles to the gallon it would have cost 33 pounds nineteen erican maybe three four pounds we spent on electric fuel in this car for this week for the near 300 miles its charged at night as i've said before when it's nice and cheap so yeah it's basically 10 percent in terms of fuel costs that's why i got this car because of the rooney cuffs we're looking off to have another car in the household so if you want to go on a long journey and have to bother about charging or anything that we can do that's where these really shine the running costs of it typically the purchase cost of an eevee is higher than the equivalent petrol an e golf versus a normal golf but it starts to do that the more you use it the chief of the car gets compared to the petrol equivalent we do a lot of miles so it does actually making cheaper to own this than a new similar sized petrol car so thank you for watching that air if you can and as always thanks for watching see you soon i can't stop this feeling deep inside of me girl you just don't realize what you do to me,-1
Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK3qIOtZKVv68oiQbgtv6AVK,e8QToP7oMro,hi guys i'm evm welcome back now i want to talk about fevs in this one or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles the vast majority of people i talk to that own one always come back and say i don't get the mpg the manufacturer says i should now i know there's many many variables and it's not a clear-cut black-and-white situation but for me ultimately it's because most people not everyone most people don't use it properly they don't utilize the plug-in hybridness that they've got at their disposable a lot of them don't even plug it in uh so that's what this is about basically i've got all of the fev i've got a typical daily commute for me which is about it's about 40 miles and uh that's you know that's above the range of the battery so i'm effectively going to show you what you should do or what you can do to get the most out of your car basically if you own a fev you will get hopefully the mpg that the manufacturer states you should get now don't get me wrong it's pretty simple and straightforward is this it's not hypermiling or anything boring that it's just pressing a few buttons telling the car what to do and when and ultimately getting high mpg which is ultimately what the fed is about if you've got a fever and you do lots and lots of motorway miles it's not the right car for you ultimately if you've got a fev and you do want to get the most out of it i.e it's not a company car then uh that's what this is for so uh yeah and enjoy it okay now my commute today is probably going to be about 40 odd miles i really should have looked at it before it sets off but i've got a good commute i've got a commute that is above the range of the car that was the whole point of doing it today normally i wouldn't have done it literally the day after this car was dropped off because this is the first time i've driven it i'm unfamiliar with the car completely and i couldn't set up the preconditioning for the cabin heater either and those are things which are very very good to do when you want to basically eke out the best mpg you can precondition in the cabin if if you're unfamiliar that basically means that you turn the heater on or you schedule the heater to come on before you set off so you get into a nice toasty warm car which is good for the driver but it's also good for the battery because a lot of energy is used to heat a car up far less than uh the maintaining that temperature so if i tell this car to preheat before i set off whilst it's still plugged into my house then the majority of that energy will come from the house because the car will pump out heat it will use a bit of the energy from the batteries obviously the engine's not running because you're not in the car so you're effectively using your house's energy to heat the cabin up and then all the car has to do when you get inside is maintain the temperature now because i know that the commute i'm doing today the journeys so we're doing several um will be a lot more than the range of the car i reckon i'm doing on a 40-yard miles it's hard to know because i'll be going to a few unknown places that i haven't received yet so i'll be doing let's say i'm doing 40 odd miles the car says it's got 27 miles of range uh so i want to to an extent i don't want to be really anal with this we're not hyper-violent as i said we're not trying to drive really economically what i want to do is pick my battles as it were and choose when i want the car to run on full electric you can leave the car in you know in its eco mud and let it choose but sometimes it it it doesn't know what we know does it can't predict or you're about to come into traffic so what i tend to do is effectively as i have already set off in full electric mode it's the first thing i do when i got in the car pour it in full electric mode that way i'm driving and i'm not using anything yet when i get to what would be an efficient road uh i know sweeping country roads where you're not going to be stopping i'll i'll put in the normal uh i'll let the car decide effectively i'll put in hybrid mode rather than full electric mode right now i'm going through this village and i'm stuck in stop start traffic i absolutely want this to be in full electric mode which the car would probably pick for me but i want to make sure that happens so i'm in for electric mode in traffic when i get onto the uh dual carriageway in a couple of minutes i will be putting it back into full hybrid mode and letting the car do whatever it wants to do in terms of engaging the engine or not because i know i cannot do this entire journey on full electric so therefore i have to use some petrol clearly if you're doing a i know 15 mile round trip today then you put it in full electric when you set off and leave it that way because you've got more range in your battery than you're going on you you will not use a drop of fuel it really is kind of basic isn't if you think about it electric is extremely cheap it's about a tenth of the cost to me when i charge at home and that's a big thing if you can charge at home this is clearly aimed at those who have bought a plug-in hybrid and can charge it so if you could charge at home using electric as much as possible is key to this entire test to this entire the whole point of it is to use as much electric as possible if you want to make it really simple might not be the most efficient thing to do put it in full electric mode every morning use the whole battery as much as you can and then if you go above your range of your car it will just end up kicking the petrol engine in but at least you've used the full battery arriving home with half a battery is ridiculous because you've burnt fuel for no reason so that's the whole point of this exercise so i'm about to go back on the bypass now so i've put the car back into hybrid mode because i want to control what the car does because i know what i'm doing today the car doesn't quite a few people will be watching this going well duh yeah kind of figure that one out use electric as much as possible that's not difficult to to know but as i said earlier so many people have a fev that i've spoken to online or in person don't even plug it in that's the first lesson isn't it plug the car in it's a plug-in hybrid if you don't plug it in it's just a petrol car i know we're gonna get a lot of people who say well i gotta give one as a company car i don't pay my fuel i can't give her monkeys well i can't help that this is aimed at people who actually care about how much they pay on fuel and how much um miles per gallon they're getting so this is all about miles per gallon if you don't care about that then it doesn't really matter does it i suppose right now i'm coming up to a roundabout after the end of this dual carriageway so i'm putting energy back in the battery i'm using regenerative braking now most people by now will probably be familiar with at least what it is but if you're not effectively that means that rather than in a traditional non-hybrid or electric car you would have brakes that basically turn that forward momentum that kinetic energy into heat by the brake disc doing that on the pad it basically slows you down with friction with regenerative braking which is a word i sometimes can't say it seems what happens then is that the the electric motor effectively turns into a generator think of it a generator on a wind turbine so the car's momentum will turn that generator and turn it into electricity so you're getting fuel back in the car every time you slow down so this is why hybrids are a lot more efficient than just a petrol only car because it's got that recuperation which a traditional car will obviously cannot ever possibly have i should point out that you will always use a lot more energy getting to speed than it will recuperate right now back in stuck in traffic full electric mode thank you very much now the car probably would have been if electric mode at this speed anyway but i want to make sure it is by doing it myself about to enter another dual carriageway so back into hybrid mode as i said you don't really have to do this if you can't be bothered doing it every single time you know it might get a little boring but that's what this exercise is about so far my consumption is 86.7 miles per gallon i've got 24 miles of range left and i have done eight miles of the journey i should point out that some plug-in hybrids will uh if you use the sat-nav will predict where it should use it and where it shouldn't so this will you know the car will effectively do what i'm just telling you to do but what the car won't know even if i use the sat nav is that i'm doing multiple trips for work today i'm not just going to work and then driving back so uh yeah only a person sometimes can really truly figure out what's best as soon as i come off this dual carriageway i'm pretty much on normal uh 30 mile roads for the rest of the journey so full electric after that that's the point so right now i'm on the dual carriageway i'm doing the speed limit which is 50 right now and the engine is driving me forward according to the car that has decided that that's the most efficient use of my fuel i'm just sat here at 50 not accelerating or anything that um so rather than deplete the battery on this road that the petrol engine can run efficiently on i'm going to save it for the for the slower bits now when it comes to miles per gallon and things this you have to pick the right car a plug-in hybrid is brilliant for normal day-to-day driving for commuting for picking the kids up from school from going to the shops from what traditionally the majority of journeys probably are there's someone that lives very near me who's got a plug-in hybrid and they're fully admitted they barely plug it in even though they do have a charger and they're just getting in drive they never fiddle with any of the settings they put in ecore sport or something that but they'll never force it in full electric mode so the amount of times they'll go to the shops and back and use some petrol because obviously the car will do its own thing to a point it's just basically wasting money as a yorkshire man i find that perplexing i really do i admit it's not the most exciting i've ever done how to get more miles per gallon there's real more runs around in there i'm doing the school run i'm going to park there and i don't care because i've got to drop little johnny off right i'm here at my first place let's see what i've got so i did 17 miles on this particular leg and so far i'm on 131 miles per gallon obviously i've used some battery on that one i've got 18 miles of range left on the battery which in a percentage term is still not familiar with this guy here we go i've got 61 percent left 5.2 miles per kilowatt hour all right well get some work done i suppose oh the car has just turned the engine on i have got one percent left on the battery basically i've used all the battery i'm probably about because i haven't gone the way that the sat nav suggested uh i don't know four or five miles oh hello four or five miles away um over country roads so i think the fact that i've been going uphill a lot has probably depleted a lot of it there um so yeah i've got a bit of downhill action coming on now uh batteries up to three percent already so i think uh once i get to the top of uh of the the moors if you it's all downhill to my house from that point i should be able to uh go back into full ev mode we'll just have to see um so yeah i'm the engine's kicking in now i'm using fuel no it's ruining my mpg and it feels strange because my foot has a slight vibration to it now because the you know the petrol engine is there and it hasn't been there for the past 45 minutes ish what can i do for you that's tight that's tight that's tight what sorry spelling is not supported hey okay i am home and that that that climb over the mars the engine kicked in i could see my miles per gallon plummet if i'd have just left on a 100 battery instead of 92 percent i better go to the top of that hill or almost to it uh okay i have done 39 miles today uh two hours 27 it's taking me to 39 miles see they're 39 miles for current journey 155 miles per gallon that's just tripped down from 4.9 to 5 miles per kilowatt hour in terms of electric consumption so what have we learned from this little jaunt well by utilizing the battery in fact what did i have i've got four percent battery left and that's only because the last bit to my house was downhill i'd i've used all electric and as i said if i'd just had a full charge oh i could i reckon i'd have got close to 200 miles per gallon but i don't think 155 miles per gallon is bad for a it's a skoda superb so it's a big car um and yeah all i've changed is effectively making sure i've used all the electric so what i want you to take away from this particular if you have a fev and you're not using it properly anyway obviously plug it in for the love of god plug it in presumably got a plug-in hybrid because of that company carricide and use your electricity all of it on each journey right okay thanks for watching guys uh if you this in fact just anyway even if you didn't it because that's the only thing manufacturers pay attention to and i'll get more cars this hopefully so yes thank you for watching and i'll see you soon,1
Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK3qIOtZKVv68oiQbgtv6AVK,-ZGd7Odw06M,hello welcome back to the i'm evm and today it's all about these things not volvos plug-in hybrids they're a divisive bunch in ev community some people think they're the spawn of the devil and need to be banned and some believe that they still for now not forever but for now have a key role to play in the electrification of the driving fleet this is about the usage of plugging hybrids who do they suit because they have a quite unique usage pattern probably more niche than a full electric vehicle does i personally believe that plugging hybrids under the proper usage pattern still have a purpose i mean it'd be lovely for everybody to get a full electric vehicle but let's face it there's a lot of usage patterns out there there's a lot of people that simply can't get one gate i've used my parents as an as the same example once more they live in a town of 55 000 people that share four four fast charges not rapid charges fast ones seven kilowatt now although my parents could get a full electric vehicle they cannot charge at home they'd have to rely on a single site of four fast charges along with 55 other thousand fifty five thousand other people and of course visitors that would be unrealistic to expect anybody to do that wouldn't it i think it would be a little naive to say oh no no no you'll be fine i mean don't get wrong they'll be fine for 80 90 percent of the time but let's face it no one can ring up and go cat coming to work today we're ready to put fuel in my car the the chargers are down so the point of this ultimately is that yes plug-in hybrids are a thing for some people and we're going to try and find you that usage pattern if you have this if you do this then the plug-in hybrid maybe your only electrification option however a lot of people out there use a plug-in hybrid as the path of least resistance tool to get something that means they don't have to worry about learning something new or trying something new no matter how easy it is to own an electric vehicle people will naturally choose something that's that's easy as opposed to better so we're going to look at the whole thing who it suits you know the reason we're going on a long journey is because we have to but we're using it as a as a good excuse to effectively say well yes if you're doing long journeys plugging hybrids make no sense at all so who is it for because the logic always comes back to me if you can plug in a plug-in hybrid you can plug in a full electric vehicle towing and various other things aside why not get a full electric vehicle instead of a fev that unnecessarily complicated even though i've never heard of a plug-in hybrid with any reliability issues again i get that i can understand it for me plug-in hybrid is for those and it's discussed more in the other i just mentioned but it's for those who have unreliable charging my parents they could charge most of the time but there will be times where it's simply not an option and that's why they would need that backup of the petrol engine unfortunately it shouldn't exist but it does the infrastructure is not there yet in swifts of the country to support people who can't charge at home and then have to rely on that infrastructure so that's affects what this is about who is a theft for because there's no point in buying one if you never plug it in there's no point in buying one as we're about to show you if you're doing lots of long journeys so what is the solution who is a fev4 that's what we're trying to find out no matter what point you switch to full electric there's gonna be people going oh my god no matter when that is yeah i think sooner you know sooner rather than later probably you're gonna have the same problems either way maybe that's the thing in it they can't rely on the infrastructure yet whether it's perceived or reality there's not that reliability there i don't know if that's going to work well tesla reside until i get there yeah most of them will but some of them don't therefore that's it no one goes out with a person who's 95 reliable you're not going to beat my kids up higher no no no no not all the time unless they annoy me yeah never mind so and it's the same it only needs a slight little bit done it to put people off yeah you don't need statistics so all ninety-five percent of your journeys are fine yeah but that five percent is going to ruin it for everything else yeah yeah so that's that's when i'm stuck in between with this fev argument because someone use it is an excuse who could clearly clearly go for a full electric right now yeah but then some are using it as a proof of concept to then get a bev and i know the argument will just go straight to the bed but we're dealing with human people yeah condition you know people weaning people off isn't it yeah you said i think it's the methadone plan do we accept that people aren't perfect and will need reassuring when they shouldn't they will not not do the best thing for them yeah so therefore let's run with that and what's the best way of doing it if we accept that some people will always need this yeah there's no point in saying we shouldn't need that people we do so rather than pretend you don't exist let's just try and control it yeah i just think that manufacturers are putting far too much effort into febs at the expense of i think the full electric stuff so it's it's slowing down that it's not a long-term thing is it a fever it's a snow you know five years from now and i'm picking that out of the air i don't see a purpose anymore for a plug-in hybrid apart from some very very small usage patterns you know big towing or something that they are more complex although to be fair it just probably is reliable well that's it no no one has ever looked at a prius over the last what 20 years and thought they were unreliable so reliable i can't believe all those taxi drivers use them yeah so i can see the complexity argument but in reality they don't seem to break down certainly no more than the normal engine car the militant ev people think we should ban thefts the door of a purpose on the road and i say well if you if you live in that niche that fits the fed world then it has a purpose my question is no one can argue that 100 of people right now cannot possibly own an eevee through affordability towing charging problems yeah there's enough there's millions of people that right now cannot unless they're massively inconvenienced not going to happen so if we ban the fev are they basically saying well keep on buying petrol or diesel cars then ignore the fed well i'll just use my diesel instead oh no you can't use diesel what am i going to do useful electric i need to tour something beautiful electric yeah and that's what i mean you can't just wish something into existence so that's where i think the fever is still for now for a short time i think for a short time yeah a thing so why pretend they don't exist this is why we review thefts well yeah why should people who can only who are stuck in that root for now oh we don't want to help them choose a car no no because they're choosing something which i disagree against and that's what i don't it's still better than the alternative isn't it well i think there's a bit of a diesel you'd think so won't you but i don't know let us know in the comments should if feds are going to disappear you can't possibly think 100 people could run an eevee so that must mean that you want them to carry on using petrol and diesel until they can get a bet is that is that what i can't believe that's what they're saying well it would seem that way wouldn't it well that's it there's no logical argument for the the de destruction of febs don't get me wrong people use it as an excuse as we've said to to not get a bev yeah yeah i think that's a thing manufacturers are putting too much effort yeah too much resources yeah yeah but even from an environmental point of view which would you prefer if you're if you're one of these that things fev should be banned would you prefer people to carry on using that diesel suv instead of a fever suv yeah i mean i'm not saying it's not a thing that fine if that's what you're saying but no one ever answers that i mean let's face it the environmental thing isn't to get an electric vehicle let's use public transport isn't it walk and cycle cycle that's too inconvenient and too expensive probably i'm too expensive if you have a choice fair enough but i i prefer the educational argument what would you respond to better the shock tactics i mean we're going to pick on the vegan vegetarian thing having to go to them it's just a good example would you pref would you be persuaded to not eat meat by the shock tactics of you know dead animals and dabertoires or by someone going this is the benefit of if you don't eat meat yeah can i talk to you about that you know this is these might be the health benefits the environment when the plus that works better yeah and that's the same thing i think we need to do with evs don't have a goat someone for their choices educate them yeah the thing is as well with evs there's so much unknown isn't it if you come from a petrol uh or a diesel car it's scary yeah yeah but it's not but that's where the education comes exactly uh so i think i think people need to just lighten up sometimes and i think persuading someone to get into something because it saves them money is more effective than banging on about yeah yeah yeah you can say it's better for this and better for that and we do that's why i've never never ever six years of doing this said by an eevee for environmental reasons because it comes across as preachy people don't being lectured today no one likes being lectured though so i guess we've now got to say is it right for you though because we're kind of proving now on long journeys plugging hybrids make no sense from a fuel mpg sort of perspective you will not get 140 miles per gallon oh no no no no if you're doing 20 30 40 miles a day you will if you plug it in anyway yeah but even if you plug it in on a long journey the further you go the worse it gets it just becomes a petrol car it's dropping now it's dropping down it covers a few genres does a feve but it doesn't have its own yeah yeah so then everyone's looking at it as an interloper in their genre electric vehicle owners no no no we don't want that petrol heads no no no we don't want it too greenhouse weight yeah so i think that's why it gets a lot of stick so ultimately who should buy a feve no more than 40 50 miles in between charges so per day usually for people that and well to answer the argument of if you can plug in a plug-in hybrid you can plug in a full electric only if it's 100 reliable yeah it's about reliable infrastructure not no not none or there isn't enough of it there is no we could not own a full electric vehicle at the moment where we live if you couldn't charge it if we couldn't charge at home it's a significant advantage you get this map people buying cars can you charge at home and easily own an ev can you reliably charge yep it's smaller and smaller it gets smaller and smaller to the point you know you need to tour yeah yeah yeah and so there is a portion of people where this would make perfect sense the plug-ins the hybrid rather but it is a small amount and i think the manufacturers are just using it to keep producing the petrol engine for as long as possible to give them time to tool off to tilt the air's change to do the toyota thing yeah whether you agree with it or not is another different kind of fish really different discussion but i think manufacturers need to accelerate the demise of of the feds yeah yeah people also have to give it more time i think that's the thing is it at the end of the day most people are gonna have to be fast into it and it's hence the ban yeah he's giving manufacturers a target to aim for people a timeline timeline and i think it makes sense because people don't change no no the courses don't change oh god never there's never a good time is it for change yep some people need to be educated some people need to be told there's not one size fits all and i think that's why the on either side that the fanatical argument the militant side yeah doesn't work so short journeys short journeys and uh occasional long journey i think so yeah it's a feather yeah if you never plug it in i think you know someone that's got a 330 e yep have they ever plugged it in how long do you own it uh oh a year a year and they've never put them in so i would say they bought the wrong car i would well it's a company car a company car and there we go that's where most feats are coming from i think isn't it i can't be bothered plugging it in and it's not my choice i'm just ticking a box on a piece of paper yeah as i get a fuel card yeah fuel card so i don't care about the costs either i mean on this journey we're gonna have to stop to fill this car up with petrol once i think we are if we had taken my ev would have stopped to fill that electric vehicle up once same it's the same thing but i can charge at home and it's easy for me to live with if it isn't you know if we lived in our first houses that's not chance not a chance it's going to happen is it you know all right well uh i guess we'll come back at the end of this journey to find out how much we got in mpg terms on this was it 360 70 mile journey yeah yeah um see how many trees we've killed yep and that ultimately would prove that not for long journeys well will it oh well yeah the battery's empty it's about to empty now yeah right and that's it in it as soon as the fed battery goes you just just petrol car with well a self-charging hybrid yeah that's all it is that's what that 330e guy has got he's got yeah yeah he never plugs it in but he can't charge at home can he uh he probably could if you wanted to easily or yeah he's got a drive so that's just laziness that's just andy's not paying for fuel yeah yeah there's no incentive for him to do that is it i bet he had the option of a tesla for 330 he was on the list but probably there is overpricing yeah all right we'll uh we'll see you when we get nearly home if the traffic are well if we ever get there if we ever get there yeah yeah even though it's a really comfortable car yeah still still a lot of driving yeah so how do the audi drivers that do 600 800 even miles in a day without stopping and that's why they can't get an electric vehicle they must have big callus on their ass right so how many miles have we done we have done can it can we go in oh yes we have we have done 357.8 miles and the mpg we'll show you the turtle driving time oh gone then eight hours 21. so we've been starting i mean we've done a bit of filming where it was on so we've probably done about seven and a half hours as i said so driving yeah uh 42.6 mpg which is expected from a two liter turbo 42 and it was pretty much fully charged when we set off yeah so effectively what would we get in the diesel version of this car would you expect i think it's 360 wouldn't you given the road works in that way modern diesel probably 60 right so you're looking at another 40 percent let's say yeah in fuel costs yeah environment aside before anyone starts banging on about diesel this is ultimate proof and evidence which we kind of knew yeah plugging hybrid yeah we knew this before we started with it is not for long journeys no so that's excellent for around town yeah and commute so i suppose if you're doing 90 local yeah the odd longer that won't bother you so it's costing me a little bit more for the two journeys a year it's usage usage pattern all again isn't it all down to usage and that's effective what i guess you need to take from this i'm not sure how easy how much you can see you need to look at the usage pattern that you will think you will have and go well we do 100 100 miles once twice a month we could be fine that's about borderline in it any more than that yeah it won't make that much sense because the savings for local journeys are going to disappear for that one it's still a valid product absolutely in this day and age definitely i think again fevs have a use but be careful with your pattern so right thanks for watching see you soon see you now i think oh there we go that's it there we go see when the cars go right cheers guys bye,1
Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK3qIOtZKVv68oiQbgtv6AVK,QbYO9xDU6Ks,hello welcome back to the i'm ivm and this is all about the massive logistical headache probably the biggest one that's facing this country when it comes to true mass ev adoption and that's how do we solve the problem for people who don't have one of these a home charger you see even if the infrastructure is exactly where we need it to be people look at this as an inconvenience and i'm about to tell you that if that infrastructure by 2035 which is ultimately when we need it to be in place by if that infrastructure does exist and it is brilliant and reliable and exactly how we need it to be it would be more convenient for the majority of people for the majority of journeys than fill in with petrol how can that be when even in the future nearly 15 years from now it will take still 20 to 30 minutes to fill up as it were compared to the five or ten minutes it does in a petrol car i get comments every day of the week from people saying i live in a flat i evs but i'm not willing to spend 20 30 minutes recharging or refueling when i only spend five to ten now it's more inconvenient i have things to do i have children to pick up i have work to get to i just can't see how well it will work but i can't see how it's not going to be more inconvenient for the 40 to 50 of people who apparently won't be able to install one of these very easily well i get that i can understand it completely but it is a misconception and it's all because of a concept which is different to fueling petrol cars called grazing with a petrol car you end up refueling on an event-based trigger the fuel light will come on or you'll get to a quarter or whatever it is you normally do and then you will visit a petrol station and get more more petrol you will refuel based on something happening in this case you getting low but the concept of grazing is very different so in electric car world it's not that it occasionally will be don't get me wrong you know everything's variable but for the majority of people on the majority of journeys you won't have that get to 20 10 or whatever and then fill back up again you will graze and the whole concept of grazing is based on the infrastructure being in place so by 2035 this infrastructure needs to be in place where we need it to be solid and reliable otherwise it won't work i fully admit that it's all about the infrastructure and not big charging hubs they're part of them don't get me wrong but the majority of what i'm about to tell you relies on destination charging that is the key now the concept of grazing is not a complicated one but i feel i need to give you a few scenarios to really show that it is going to be nice and convenient and ultimately different to what you're used to and it's all about that learning something new isn't it people don't that it's the path of least resistance i've always done this i'm always wanting to do this smartphones i'm not going to type on a touchscreen who's going to do that i want to use a keyboard i do with my old nokia and blackberries and now fast forward just what five ten years and everybody's using a touchscreen to type on and it's the same sort of battle that we've got with evs anyway this concept of grazing let's imagine i cannot charge it from home i've got a 200 mile range ev which in 14 years time will be well the bog standard cheapest ev you could buy easily everything's getting better as time goes on the last five years ranges have practically doubled so in another 14 15 years who knows where we'll be at but let's imagine i've got 200 mile range ev and i can't charge from home that won't be a problem if destination charging is in place so i'm on i know 50 right now 100 miles worth of range i'm driving to work that takes uh 15 miles say out of my range and then of course 15 getting back home again so going to work and back loses me 30 miles but that car is sat there for eight hours doing nothing absolutely nothing it's a complete brick it's just sat there wasting away we might as well charge it we might as well get it doing something even on a three-pin plug socket we're not talking expensive chargers here a fast charger would be more than ideal in that eight hours you're pretty much going to have a full tank at the end of it so if you can charge at work it will probably be almost as convenient as charging from home because most people work for five days a week and most of the year so for what twice a week you charge up at work and then you're done pretty much but what if you can't charge from work because not everybody has that i go from site to site for example you may go to the supermarket on your way back home all right then i'm i've got a big shop coming up that's about an hour and in that one hour i've used 20 miles there and back into the supermarkets here which is quite far quite for most people so i've wasted 20 miles but i've gained 30 35 in that one hour of stopping at the supermarket so i've ended up with 10 to 15 miles more range by visiting the supermarket go to a restaurant spend an hour and a half there if you can charge there you'll end up getting probably 30 40 miles more than you spent getting to the restaurant go to the cinema three hours ish certainly on today's films anyway in that three hours you've got 100 miles worth of range how fast the cinema from you 5 10 15 miles away so if everywhere you visit has at least some charging not literally every parking space but if it's again how we need it to be the infrastructure you will end up grazing at each place you come to your electric range will do this you won't wait until it gets empty and then visit a petrol pump equivalent you'll just stop off and get a little bit of energy everywhere you stop that's the whole concept of grazing most people again work five days a week uh eight hours a day you you would only need to plug it in for a couple of those days to get hundreds of miles worth of range so again it's all based on this destination charging being utterly utterly key to it all working we recently went to chester zoo and it's not exactly next door for us but it wasn't a problem as i'm about to show you this is a perfect casing point i'm here at chester zoo we'll be here for many many hours and look there are 23 charging points here now a lot of people will think well if it's hundred and two hundred miles to chester zoo for example because people do travel here uh well my car under 150 miles or the electric vehicle i'm looking at so i don't want one i don't want to have to spend an extra 30 40 minutes charging even today let alone in the future well you won't do because you'll drive to the zoo the destination you'll charge up and then you leave with pretty much a full battery and that's the whole point so effectively i can drive here and back again in a low range gv because i know i can charge whilst i'm doing my thing i'm losing more time it's more convenient to do this than stop at a petrol station that's a perfect example done properly obviously we're here we've got 14 years for them to literally litter the car park with even you know with many many charges but in today's world in ev numbers that's about right it's brilliant because as i said in the you can charge for hours you can get tons of range which unless you're going up and down the country should be more than enough you almost always end up coming back with more than you're left with and even if you think well i'm only spending 15 minutes at a supermarket well then that's why supermarkets should have rapid charges as well as lots of fast charges so you think okay i'm there for 15 minutes i'll plug it into a rapid charger and in that 15 minutes certainly 15 years from now you're going to end up getting 100 150 miles worth of range all for just stopping in at your local supermarket and picking up a few items so i'm not saying it won't occasionally come up as an inconvenience and that every single restaurant and every single shop is going to have charges but if we get enough of them if the government have incentives and grants and really push it and make it easy for people to install them it can work and work really really well we need to put these charges where they make sense most people have probably seen the what is typically two rapid charges on the electric highway at ikea stores now they were put in many years ago as part of a i guess a green thing that ikea were doing but ultimately they're the stupidest chargers in the world because they're in the wrong place i mean a rapid charger even today it's probably done in most tvs after anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes and if you're going to that store and not just using it to charge up on route who could do ikea in 20 minutes or even 30 or even 40. pretty much everybody who shops at ikea and plugs in the car's finished way before they are so then somebody else turns up sees a car that's finished charging and is blocking the charge point and then gets angry so that is the worst example really because it's in the wrong place it's all right having a few rapid charges but it's the fast charges that what is what they should have put in because 30 fast charges which is probably the equivalent price of just a couple of rapid charges will be far more effective in a place that people spend an hour or two or three getting the right destination charges in the right places is again key to all this happening if you have what they call the park and rides lots of fast chargers because the idea of pack and ride is that you'll be there for many hours rapid chargers you want some because there might be people that need to just have a quick top up they're on an onwards journey but ultimately we need to get the ratio correct so there's a lot of things that need to happen i'm not naive to the big challenge that's coming up here in terms of getting this all in place but it has to happen otherwise those that cannot charge from home will have the worst experience that they're worried about i mean let's face it you've got almost 14 years before the new car sales of plug-in hybrids which effectively is a petrol engine before they get banned so unless you plan on buying a new car in 2035 or 2036 you're going to have over 15 years before it's a problem for you 15 years ago doesn't sound a long time but it is smartphones literally didn't exist back then or in contact form maybe and now look everybody's got one you can get one for 50 quid and it'll stream 4k netflix it's this patience that i think we need to to just get a bit more of that no one's forcing you into an ev you don't have to get one today it's a choice and i would always personally prefer to to jump when i choose to as opposed to when you're pushed but there's still a lot of time there's going to let's face it 20 years before you have to get an electric vehicle before the used market for petrol gets to the point where you can't find the car that's suitable for you there's many variables and of course traveling salesmen you know the people that do hundreds of miles of day yes then you're gonna probably have a slightly more inconvenient journey until something truly quick turns up in ev world in terms of charging um i don't see your way around that hopefully by now you'll go all right i kind of get it if i could charge up everywhere i stopped then i won't have to fill up the car is refueling when you're doing stuff getting on with your life and let's face it petrol stations are not a nice place to visit it's not convenient just because after decades and decades of doing it we're used to it your hands stink there's always some muppet doing a full shop whilst they're filling up with petrol at the same time and you you sat there going for god's sake it's not convenient and just five ten minutes you have to spend with your car you have to stand there holding that nozzle waiting for it it's ten minutes out of your life you're never getting back i'd rather go to a supermarket plug in and then walk off because i was going to the supermarket anyway so therefore the net loss from my time out of my life is almost zero it's more convenient for me you just have to make sure well not you but the uk and the world has to make sure that these charges are in place i think supermarkets will will happen they're not stupid they want people to visit them so that's already happening now and it's just it'll just get bigger and bigger i've seen one supermarket i think with 48 charges in it so yeah that's just a matter of time but the restaurants will be tough you know council car packs should be easy retail car packs should be easy again that's happening in a lot of them already and so it's all about getting back what you used or more getting to your destination back as i said just if you go to the scenery just if you've got a restaurant you end up coming back with more than you're left with so that's the whole concept there are many variables there are many exceptions you'd have to tell me them all i i i i get that it will not be for every journey but if the majority of your journeys are more convenient and some are less it balances out i still think it will have the tipping point towards the ev again once everything's in place but i'll shut up but for now you know it's just going to take time remember we're at the relatively early adopter stage still it doesn't have to suit every single person today they're too expensive for a lot of people if you can't charge from home i probably wouldn't own one i suppose you could almost test this concept imagine you couldn't charge your phone at home for whatever reason if you plugged in at work each day or whenever you fancied if you then plugged in at the supermarket when you were there if you plugged in uh at the restaurant when you were at the restaurant or the cinema when you were at the cinema you probably wouldn't need to charge this at home would you you'd have to get used to the fact that you would be setting off in the morning with 20 30 but ultimately you'd never run out of charge unless of course you stayed at home for many days and that's why the analogy kind of falls down but when you're not using the ev it it's not really losing anything maybe one percent a week so yeah it's not the best analogy but you get my point if you plug in everywhere else you visit you won't need to at home so hopefully this this whole all the whole idea of the of the grazing concept has laid a few fears there's still going to be plenty of ifs and buts but the big if if it is in place the you know all the charges then it's fine it's going to be fine well i think i'm done uh people who were members got to watch this a week early they've got to listen to the podcast early and there are members on the videos as well that is just on the join button next to and it costs from 99p just less than a quid a month for all this extra netflix beating content either way thanks for watching guys i'll see you soon,1
Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK3qIOtZKVv68oiQbgtv6AVK,qP14huHqims,hello welcome back to the i'm ivm and today we're talking about the used ev market it's a that i've done every year for the past several years only this time it's a bit different because the used market is utterly bonkers right now i mean talking about petrol and electric it's just off the charts i've got a few examples for you the twizzy that i recently sold that went for a thousand pound more than i paid for it even if you factor in the windows and the insurance and and the service basically everything i spent on it i reckon i made 500 pounds by owning and driving a twizy which is crazy the model 3 packed on my driveway right now i could get almost what i paid for it even though it's 18 months old and he's done 20 000 miles it's really really crazy even in non-ev world the mini cooper s that i have that was i reckon 11 11 and a half a year ago 13 13 and a half right now even we buy any car will give me 12 and a half for it and they're probably the worst example of getting a good deal from uh selling a used vehicle so for me a used eevee is the entry-level ev but right now unfortunately it's going to be quite difficult for anybody to enter the market it's just crazy and i don't see it changing neither do cap or glasses you know the people that do the car bibles and things they don't see this changing in the next six months or so and even then probably more of a stabilization than dropping back down again so uh let's look at what's on the market i am ignoring non-cars the twizy and the g whiz they're heavy quadruple cycles i'm only concentrating on full electric cars um and i'm not choosing the cheapest one of each sort of price bracket i'm going to start the lower end and go up to 20. and i'm going to pick ones that are slightly interesting i'm going to try and get a different uh car across the price bracket sort of range not not just go for another newer leaf or another newer zoy something that because back then back in 2011 2012 2013 when these came out it was basically it tesla aside do you want a leaflet you want a zoe there wasn't many options out there um so i'm gonna try and give you a broad kind of outlook of the usd market not specifically specifically pick the best ones but there are some reasonable deals out there maybe not compared to a few years ago but let's have a look to see what is on the market you'll have to excuse me if my voice sounds sexier than normal but i've been i've had the lurgy for the past week and i can't seem to shake it anyway let's get on with this uh we're starting at what would normally be between kind of four seven four eight and five grand that's where the previous videos have started however now the cheapest one i've got to show you it's a renault so it's a 2013 um and it's 5 900 pounds if you bought that two or three years ago you better get for about yeah five grandish and even now two three years later it's nearly six thousand pounds it has of course a battery lease and i fear i need to mention this again because even though i've mentioned it in every single about used evs it always appears in the comment section battery lease just wipes out my fuel savings no it doesn't if you buy a batch release car for well six thousand pounds if you wanted the battery owned version of it so basically the same car but no lease you'd be paying several thousand pound more for it so you've got the initial massive chunk of saving there whatever you're paying monthly if you are if you've got loan for it there's your saving you're paying 600 quid a year-ish for the lease but you're saving thousands of pounds in the first place now i've never been a fan of batch releasing from new it didn't really make that much sense to me and ultimately as is proven now years later was unnecessary they did it because people were worried about the batteries and that kind of negated the worry only nissan and renault ever did a batch release nissan stopped years ago and i think they've bought almost every leaf out there that was ever about released car there's probably a few pottering around still but i couldn't find one so there's only renaults always that you can get a batch release on still not new only on the used market no one else no other manufacturers ever touched leasing and nobody right now and for the past maybe year-ish does battle releasing either now so it's gone it'll it will disappear all these won't exist you know in five ten years from now but if you do have one of these bachelor leasing this is where it is quite advantageous because you've got what what's that a 20 30 you're eight years of somebody else paying for that lease and then you're taking it on on an eight-year-old car yeah you're spending 600 quid a year-ish but that battery is completely under warranty perpetual warranty never stops and what do people worry about the most in electric car world certainly in the used market on an eight-year-old ev especially the the first generation ones the ones that you know if any are gonna suffer any battery degradation it's these who cares it's under battery warranty you can keep that running for as long as you want the only other thing that you have to well you don't even have to worry about it's an electric motor there's nothing to go wrong so i think that's a bargain in terms of the batch release concept because well i'll give you an example of somebody that did this a couple of years ago with a leaf lease uh he bought one that had done astronomical miles i think it was close to 200 000 it was a lease battery and the guy that sold it just said well it's done huge miles the battery's got i think something 71 72 of its original range left so it let it go for a complete steal because the guy unfortunately for him assumed it was relatively worthless of course with being about to lease the person who bought it just run it for a month or two until it went below that 70 marker contacting nissan and now he's driving around in a car with a brand new battery in it they don't have to put brand new battery in but that's typically what happens if this ever needs replacing so you could just keep that going for as long as you want for 600 quid a year i mean would you do that if you bought an eight-year-old car would you pay 600 pounds to effectively cover the only thing that you re that would cost a lot of money to replace i guess the engine is the comparable one in a petrol car yeah that's one two i don't know but for six grand you get in the car granted it's only gonna do 60 70 miles again first generation stuff but it's a second vehicle i think not bad not bad let's move on now this one is a leaf it's roughly the you know about a thousand pound more than it was a year or so ago again 6 325 pounds uh a 2011 so it's one of the early ones it's got uh i think it was about 87 88 battery health on it which for a car which is 10 year old i think is very very good again first generation stuff for you and the reason i've brought this in is because sometimes there's always not big enough this is the size of a golf there's always the size of a clio and that's the reason i went for a leaf back in 2015 rather than the uh zoe because i needed that extra space i needed a family car so 37 000 miles 6 325 pound no batch release on that one of course again similar range to the zoe so at this price bracket these are second cars i think for the majority of people looking into one right moving on again i thought i'd choose something a little bit different excuse me rather than go well here's a six and a half thousand here's a seven thousand pound leaf and as always and then you know i'm skipping the ones i've already shown you in terms of cars unless there's something new um uh that that's come up but this one is just quite different quite cute very small and bizarrely popular it's a smart fortwo 2013 8 000 pounds so we've gone up in price a fair bit here uh 24 000 miles it's just a smart car that's full electric it's gonna cost pennies to run and uh yeah i think if you live in an urban environment well a city environment certainly or you've got a tiny little driveway or something they do seem remarkably popular never been a fan of them myself but it is a little different from the average zoe or leaf next we have another leaf now the reason i've chosen this one it's just under 9000 pounds it's a 2060 it's basically the same car i owned it's even the same color a 2016 leaf nine grand that is a 30 kilo hour version so it's the bigger battery version which is why i brought it up again the battery on that is eight years warranty 100 000 miles battery's still under warranty it's nine grand it'll do probably given its age 90 95 miles i reckon on average again might be a second vehicle or a commuter car for people but i think that is a decent value again it's not gone down much at all compared to what i sold mine for uh nearly two years ago now so the one thing you can take from this is that if you bought one of these that i've just mentioned or ones that i'm going to mention the depreciation curve is so low not just due to the current market but evs have always had a very low depreciation curve you could sell it in a year's time or two years time and get the majority of your money back they're a safe bet because such small numbers are made back then compared to traditional cars they're always going to be rare and rare things tend to go up in value right next so we're at 9 grand now i said i've skimmed past obvious zoes and leafs newer versions of what i've already shown you okie dokie right bit of a jump now um again chosen this because it's a little bit different it's a bmw i3 ten thousand pounds uh the original battery size so again range is going to be comparable to what i've already shown you but it's a bmw i3 it's not just the badge this is i think this is definitely a future classic i mean it looks the same there but in mind this is seven years old than it does if you bought one you know this year the newest version of what you can get they've never really changed it beyond a very very slight uh cosmetic change here and there so i mean that's got private ridge on it no one would know how old that is if you're bothered about that sort of thing but it's a carbon fiber car the tube is carbon fiber which back then was done to counter some of the batteries where now technology's moved on so it's unnecessary which is why they stopped doing the bmw i range of cars but it's quick i mean very quick my favorite uh stat if you for the i3 is that to 30 miles per hour which again is not a great metric but i guess for the traffic light grandpa it's not bad it's the quickest bmw you could get certainly a year or two back i don't know if it's still the case it's quicker than an m3 i mean that is rapid off the line that instant talk rear-wheel drive not the best car in the world but it is really interesting you've got all the suicide doors and and the cuteness and the the compact nature of it and i said that performance and so yeah 10 grand 8 000 miler again that will hold its value very well next i've gone back to the zoe because for 11 264 pounds this is the 40 kilowatt version now this is where you're bordering on very very usable range in summer you'll get 200 miles out of that maybe 160 in colder months so that could absolutely be a car for a lot of people in terms of range size and whatnot you know again i guess it's going to be a a couple's car or a commuter car or a second car or something but just over 11 grand and you're getting what is very very usable and modern range a lot of cars coming out now have a similar range to this as in evs 70 000 miles and of course is a battery lease but again you've got that added benefit that i said earlier that would be about 14 grand i reckon if it was battery owned so it depends which way you want to jump you could spend thousands more so you've no lease i'll do it that way and get most of your money back when it comes to selling it again a bit of a jump up in price we've kind of uh you know skipped a lot of more zoe's and all the stuff i've already shown you but for 13 and a half grand just under one of the most fun cars you can get in electric car world and uh the newer version of this it's a cow i would absolutely own seriously if i'm looking at a a second ev to replace say the mini or something they're just cracking fun it's the volkswagen e up this is uh 2015. uh the current one is a bigger battery version so this is obviously again in that sort of similar price ranges the others i've shown you uh probably 70 80 miles something that but as a town car it's fantastic very cheap to run it you just feel you're driving a car as opposed to the car driving you it doesn't cost at you in the same way but it is comfortable it's practical yet tiny it's just a great vehicle in general no matter what you know whether it's petrol or electric uh thirty or thousand miles thirteen and a half thousand pounds and and again bear in mind that was probably twenty one-ish six years ago barely any depreciation similar price next a bit of a curve ball on this one normally it's not a car i recommend but again i'm just trying to give you a broad range of what's out there this is 13 750 so it's similar price to the up however it's a mercedes b-class five years old the b-250e and it's incredibly comfortable great ride it's it's a b-class mercedes for 13 750. a five-year-old one it does have an achilles heel though which again means it's sony for certain people it can't rapid charge seven kilowatt only i can't remember if it was eleven but basically you're looking at a three or four hour minimum charge uh to get it back up to full so it's going to be a local car only for some people that'll be fine it's oh well as a second car that's perfect and for that price for the same as the eop but you can't rapid charge it's worth mentioning because it is a very very good comfortable cast mercedes thirteen and a half grand that's gonna cost you pennies to run now we're going to again something a little bit different but everyone that owns one of these says they're brilliant and they are very efficient as well it's effectively the same size battery as the 30 kilowatt leaf will but we'll do about 15 miles of range more so about 10 more for the same battery size it's the kia soul ev it's a quirky one the new version i think looks far better than that but of course it's a different uh animal completely fourteen thousand pounds or a five-year-old version you'll get about 110 miles out of it even now uh so yeah i put it in because it's different but it is a very capable ev and rare as well which only aids the resale value there's not a lot of these around compared to things the leaf and the zoe so if you want to be a bit different there's that one i can get through this i can get through this coughing my lungs up but we're working through it moving on 15 349 pounds it's a nissan leaf of 40 kilowatt hour it's done a lot of miles for its age 89 000 but it's only two years old so i thought i'd put that in just because you're getting a well a two-year-old car for 15 just over 15 000 pounds the warranty on that is a hundred thousand miles eight years in terms of the battery warranty so you know what i wouldn't worry about it given how long people typically keep the cars if you need a family car that would be fine it's big enough for that sort of stuff but i suspect this again will probably be i need a second car again but to fit the family the high miles wouldn't bother me at all because again there's very little to go wrong in evs this again is a zoe um 16 grand but it's again a 40 kilowatt hour version but this is battery owned there's no lease on this one so it gives you an example of what you can get if you ignore the lease if you think i don't want the least i don't want any of that faffing around i want one that i can just buy and an anon so this is uh effectively the same as what i've shown you it's obviously newer this is in 2019 so again probably two and a half years old now but for 16 grand you've got a car that again will do 200 miles a bit less in winter so that for me is is i suppose you call it the entry-level modern usable eve usable ev as in the range many people don't know what sort of range would suit them i need 500 miles when did you last do over 200 in one go i still want 500 miles that's for a different topic but ultimately 16 grand i think for a two-year-old zoe that's not bad and it's the 110 version slightly quicker so you know they upgraded the motor and that's in the purple mad color too again just to be different same sort of age range two years old 16 for 80. this is the hyundai ioniq which is again smaller or similar battery version size to the 30 leaf but you'll get another 10 15 miles out of it very efficient decent size i also think it makes a good taxi in terms of size and practicality and cost a little old school in its looks but that is a very capable practical decent sized boot car 16.5 grand two years old again 83 000 miles i wouldn't really worry too much about mileage and evs personally pretty much the same price 16.5 grand a five-year-old e-golf i mean it's just a golf with an electric drivetrain some 30 000 miles yes it's range not gonna be great it's to be well 100 ish uh it's been a while since i've driven one so i'm kind of doing that by memory but it's a golf and it's the same interior it's the same sort of ride it looks good still even today that's not bad at all i do that's the one car that i almost wish i'd have bought at some point it's just that they didn't really produce them in the numbers that made them a decent new car price compared to your leafs and things so um now we're moving on to what is effectively a car that is uh not quite a year old the say at me it's the same as the volkswagen eat up just science version of it but this is the newer version with the bigger battery 17 250. again immensely good fun to drive you'll get at least 130 miles out of it in the real world even in winter probably a lot more practical than it looks and a perfect second car 17 250. so you're saving about three and a half grand on the new car price of that it's a year old that you could keep for a couple of years and get your money back i'm convinced that it it will be a nearly no cost car you just need to have the initial money to get one and then sell it again and finally we come to the last one which is again it's less than a year old it's 20 grand it's the box all corsa e i've just put this in just because it's it's a new car it's on sale right now it kind of highlights that the nearly new market isn't that good certainly at the moment anyway 20 grand for one of those for nearly a year old 22 will get you a new one if you're patient enough and you shop around i've seen these go for 21 and a half this whole adage of you lose a third of the car's value after you buy it it doesn't exist not in the moment anyway and not in electric car land some people you know if you 20 is your absolute limit and you can't afford extra two or three grand for a brand new one it's an option um but it just again it highlights the fact that you could buy a brand new ev right now and get most of your money back if you're only keeping it a year or two or even the three years think about the total cost of ownership if you buy some 20 grand and you sell it for 15 three years later it's cost you 5 000 pounds if you buy something for 15 grand and sell it for 10 000 pounds three years later it's cost you five grand it's the same price so as long as you can afford the monthly payments or the initial outlay they're no more expensive to own it's a weird one is this because normally i to find a few bargains in ev land when i have a look around and they're very few and far between now because of the used market going crazy so that's steve's market it's uh i wouldn't say good value but that's what it is i can't change that if this looks bad value to you then well it's how things are what hasn't gone to a ridiculous amount at the moment i need four tires if i'd have got them a month ago i'd have had 20 maybe 30 pounds per corner less it's the same tires i've looked around everything's just gone up food's going up transport's gone the entire world's gone crazy and unfortunately the ev world isn't immune to that so uh yeah let me know what you think have you bought any used evs recently tell us in the comments section what you bought was a good price have you bought a used dv a year or two or three ago and you sold it recently and you thought well i've got most of my money back tell us your use dv stories and um yeah thanks for watching uh again apologies for the rather course sexier voice you,-1
Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK3qIOtZKVv68oiQbgtv6AVK,bW7Aovm7esE,hello i'm evm welcome back to the and today i'm going to revisit a that i did not far off two years ago and that was how much does 100 000 miles worth of fuel costs using one of these an electric vehicle versus 100 000 miles in a petrol or diesel car back then it was clear advantage to an ev and since then the petrol price has risen considerably however electricity has gone up even more than that in percentage terms especially so is it a case now that the ev is still massively cheaper to charge than it is put petrol in a car or is there a situation where it would be cheaper to run a petrol car in terms of fuel alone than it would be an electric one for that we need of course to go upstairs to see the whiteboard of truth now let me explain this table here where i've got combustion engine and electric vehicles the ice side of it is pretty straightforward really it's just basic maths 30 miles per gallon down to 70 miles per gallon remember that's uk gallons if you're across the pond and that's based on today's average price in the uk which according to the race website is one pound 47 pence per liter the electric vehicle side of it is broken up into two bits people who can charge at home and people who can't who have to rely on the public charging network i'll explain the home bit in a second first let me explain the price i've used for the public charging which is 30 pence per kilowatt hour rapid charging is at the moment i would say 40 to 45 pence per kilowatt hour it's it's gone up considerably in the last year however if you can't charge at home you wouldn't exclusively use rapid charges in fact you'll try to use them as least as possible because they're the most expensive destination charges workplace if you can supermarket charges i'm not saying you wouldn't use rapids you absolutely would but you would have a mixture of the two and of course there are many many variables i'm going for averages here as always so some supermarkets don't charge at all for any charging on a normal fast charger not a rapid one um some charge 20 30 ap sometimes 30 odd pence some charge 40p for the rapid charges some charge a bit less you know tesla superchargers or 20 odd pens for example so there's so many variables i've settled on a final figure of 30 pence per kilowatt hour because as i said some will be a cheap rate some will be expensive so that for me is about right but there are again many variations on that one i'm sure a few people will say that's not quite accurate but i think it's close enough for an average now in terms of the home charging again this isn't just as straightforward as this miles per gallon times however much it is per liter this is how i've broken up the home charging uh slot if you will uh based on my experience of charging at home for the last six seven years as well speaking to other people eighty-five percent of my charging is done at night when it's cheap on the on the best tariff shall i say uh which at the moment for me is octopus go so i pay what was just very recently and by very recently uh i mean it happened halfway through filming this it's very recently gone up to seven and a half pence per kilowatt hour for four hours during the night which is effectively what 85 of the mileage i do comes from five percent have priced it at 30 pence which is the new day rate nearest damn it anyway the new day rate for octopus go um so i only really use that if i just need to do a quick top-up it's very rare but it does happen and 10 of the mileage i do is done on the rapid charging network when i'm out and about and i've put that at 40 pence per kilowatt hour so effectively 85 of the miles 5 of the miles 10 of the miles based at the various prices gives us these figures here which i'll come to in a second so that's how it's kind of all figured out um yes there are many different tariffs out there some people are on a flat rate of 30 pence when i say 30 beat that's what it will be this year so let's forget what you're on now this is what you will be on at some point this year assuming your tariff expires at some point in the next 12 months because prices are shooting up i mean massively so the day rate for octopus go was i think well at least for me at the moment until me 14 and a half pence it's now nearly 30. that's double same with flat rate tariffs a lot of them were kind of 14 15 pence now again we'll be looking at 30 perhaps up to 40 in the next 12 months so this isn't what you have paid this is what i expect you to pay over the next year or so next couple of years ish obviously things will change which is why i've redone this so there's a lot of variables on this one there's a bit of guesswork involved as well but hopefully that explains how i've come to these figures and hopefully why it should make sense clearly there's a massive advantage if you can charge at home compared to the public charging network but again come back to that in a minute right combustion engine vehicles now so if your car does an average of 30 miles per gallon remember that's over 100 000 miles not what you get on the long run not what you get going to work and back over its entire life well 100 000 mile life anyway 22 276 pounds is what you'll spend on fuel if your car averages 30 miles per gallon if you go let's skip a bit down here if you get 50 which i would say is about roughly average at the moment for petrol cars or diesel 13 366 pounds thirteen and a half grand nearly on fuel alone for a hundred thousand miles and if you've got a super efficient car maybe it's a self-charging hybrid or something that or whatever it does i thought i'd put it there just to be safe then nearest damn it nine and a half thousand pounds for a hundred thousand miles worth of fuel obviously this is just fuel i'm ignoring maintenance which is cheaper for evs i'm ignoring tax which is cheaper for evs this isn't which car is cheapest this is purely based on fuel right so that does that one you can see what we've done for combustion engine let me now concentrate on the cheapest the home chargers if you get 2.5 miles per kilowatt hour which is an inefficient ev then it will cost you just over 4 000 pounds for 100 000 miles of fuel of electricity 3.75 miles per kilowatt hour which i would say is about the average in ev world you know if you if you couple together all evs 3.75 is is for me what is about the average miles per kilowatt hour so this is the uh mpg equivalent if you will not directly but you know what people think of up here then that will cost you two thousand seven hundred and twenty two pounds for that one hundred thousand miles and if you've got a really efficient ev which gets five miles per gallon per kilowatt hour over a hundred thousand miles not many will do that certainly not over a hundred thousand miles anyway two thousand pounds just just over two thousand pounds for that now public charging thirteen 13 800 pounds if you've got an inefficient ev that does 2.5 miles per kilowatt hour so that just shows the difference between being able to charge at home and having to use just the public charging network i'm sure it will change in the future there'll be a lot more destination charges that'll be cheaper there will probably be subscription models that if you're a heavy user you can get this again at a cheaper cheaper rate bp pulse do something that um but at the moment as it stands based on my predictions then you're well not far off 9 000 pounds worse off if you can't charge at home i guess that's the benefit of having uh off-road parking and the ability to charge of course but you could argue that the house you bought that has a drive is probably thousands tens of thousands of pounds maybe depending on where you are in the country more expensive to buy it's one of those things in it not everyone's going to have everything and let's not go down that road at the moment but it just does show the difference between the two if you have what i would consider again the average miles per kilowatt hour three point seven five then you're looking at just over nine grand and five miles per hour just under seven thousand pounds so let's take the averages 3.75 3.75 and for me 50 miles per gallon 13 366 pounds if you've got a combustion engine car 2722 if you can charge at home and 9200 so worst case scenario if you buy an electric vehicle over 100 000 miles then you will be about just over 4 000 pounds better off over that hundred thousand miles so it depends on how long it takes you to do 100 000 miles isn't it and that's just fuel remember not tax and maintenance all the other things that are lower if you do charge at home however then you're uh what 10 and a half ish yeah 10 between 10 and 11 let's have ridgid out of that between 10 and 11 000 pounds better off that's over a thousand pounds per 10 000 miles that you would drive so at 10k a year you'll save a thousand pounds a year again if you can charge at home this is why when we say electric vehicles aren't as expensive as people think they are you need to factor in all costs so let's imagine well in fact no let's not imagine let's go back to a real world experience that i've had when i got my first ev i paid about 200 pounds a month in fact no it was 200 pounds a month with a 500 quid deposit to get my first tv it saved me 170 pounds in fuel alone he practically paid for itself i could have bought a car for a hundred pounds per month a petrol caravan and you think well i'm 100 a month better off but i'd have spent 70 pounds more in total because of the petrol costs so fuel and monthly payments were higher than the electric car even though the electric car was more expensive in terms of its list price so this is kind of why this is very important you need to pick your battles of course if you catch at home then it's a harder sell for example if you've got an inefficient ev a an audi e-tron or something you know one of the big suv gas guzzler equivalents nearly 14 000 pounds which is the equivalent to almost 50 miles per gallon so public charging network it's it's where the tipping point is really in terms of fuel costs it will be cheaper yeah i'm ignoring environmentalism for this one so this is purely financial it would be cheaper to get a petrol or diesel car that does 50 60 to 70 miles per gallon than it would get an inefficient ev however as soon as you trip down to an average ev you will be slightly better off you need to kind of look at the car you either have or would be getting if you're in that position and see where it comes what's the average mass per kilowatt hour it does and can you charge it home or not so for me anyone that can charge at home and afford an ev it's a total no-brainer look at the difference i mean if we took the most inefficient ev versus one of the most inefficient elect petrol cars should i say 30 miles per gallon versus two and a half although i've had a couple that have done less than 30 certainly but even if we just look at that look at the difference 18 000 pounds 18 grand just in fuel that's enormous it's a car in itself i suppose you could look at this and think well if i can't charge at home it's worth getting an efficient ev because let's look at the difference we are talking about 100 000 miles here for most people that's 10 years worth of driving for some people it's going to be four years for me for me i reckon we do that in four or five years if you're lucky enough obviously to be near a supermarket as i know a few people are who can't charge up and at the moment it's free well they're saving more than people could charge at home because yes it's inconvenient they have to charge at the supermarket some of them sit there and read a book some of them do the shopping whilst they're charging up there because it is only a fast charger but they're getting free fuel at least for now anyway that will carry on forever though will it let's face it and although i do think there will be some incentive that supermarkets will put in again they do with petrol diesel cars you know his is a voucher for whatever pence per liter off your petrol if you shop with us and so forth again if we factor in maintenance cheaper for eva if we factor in tax cheaper for ev this is why you have to look at the whole package the total cost of ownership and at the moment given the used car prices are ludicrous for all of this but even more so for electric vehicles depreciation is minute at the moment for evs in fact a lot of them are appreciating the used ones uh i'll give you one example someone i spoke to on twitter just yesterday got offered nine and a half thousand pounds for their nissan leaf a year ago they've just been offered from the same place 12 grand i don't think anyone will notice i'm slyly editing in this after i filmed the whole but i thought i'd explain how i got to the mass per kilowatt hour i think a little bit more let's take the five miles per kilowatt hour 100 000 miles divided by five gives us 20 000 kilowatt hours worth of energy i've then added 15 on top of that to account for the losses for energy losses for when you charge a car so for example if you charge the car from flat to full that could take 50 kilowatt hours it would need at least probably 57 to fill it up because there is a bit of efficiency loss in terms of you know heat and various other stuff when you charge an evap so just wanted to make sure that i get that out there because i know people will ask yes losses have been accounted for in all these figures apart from these here because ultimately rapid charging is dc to dc and it's far more efficient right i think i'm done uh thank you for watching i hope that makes sense and we'll see what's this going to be in another two or three years will the ev still have the advantage will petrol stabilize will it go down will it carry on going up will electric stabilize for me 30 pence is again is that's the new normal at least minimum and i don't think that's we're never going back to the 15 pence kilowatt hour average ever for me i i really don't see that coming um and yes i should probably point out as more people did in the last the majority of this is tax if you compare the fuels together they're about the same doesn't matter doesn't matter if the 90 of this is tax on none of its tax this is what you pay when you go and buy it so there's no point in going on about it's the same price if you ignore the tax thing that is irrelevant to me that is what it is okay thank you for watching uh i'll see you soon,1
Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK3qIOtZKVv68oiQbgtv6AVK,nN2gXKS8R4A,hello and welcome back to the i'm evm and today i want to talk about the prices of battery electric vehicles this year the calendar year of 2022 because if you look at last year's prices of what was achievable as in not the list prices but the ones that you could haggle and search for online and get basically they've kind of evaporated they've disappeared you don't seem to get anywhere near the deal that you did last year this year so is 2022 or at least the first part of it a period when you should just hold off if you're thinking about getting an ev if you've got the money ready basically if you can press the button as it were is it worth holding off or should you do it sooner rather than later before i go any further remember this is a prediction predictions could be wrong so do your own research listen to this you know i i genuinely think this is what will happen this is what i'm using in my own personal life and anyone that asks this is what i will say but everyone's different everyone's got their own unique usage pattern and financial situation whatever do your own research listen to everyone else and then make the best decision for that okay i'm a guy on youtube i'm not the oracle but this is what i think will happen in terms of getting an ev this year and the prices of them uh effectively if you are in a position to buy one you know the finances are pretty much there you know what you're buying i wouldn't wait i wouldn't rush into it you know you didn't panic or anything but i also wouldn't wear you know i wouldn't say well let's give it another six months see what happens with the prices let's let's wait till the end of the year i for me personally would do it sooner rather than later now there are several reasons i think that um most of it is on my phone so i'm gonna have to refer to this and but essentially ev's this is just one of several things evs are more popular now than they ever have been sold more in 21 than i think many years beforehand combined and 2022 is looking that even more people will buy evs some even think that there will be 50 increase on the amount of electric vehicles that bought compared to 2021 so we're talking a lot of interest there so you've got a lot more people wanting something but you're still gonna have shortages there's a long lead time for most electric vehicles at the moment uh the chip shortages and various other things of course is what's causing that now all indications that i've read about are that the chip shortage may ease a little bit this year but ultimately it's not disappearing we're not suddenly be flooded with chips and everything's great that i still haven't going to have an effect so if you've got a lot more people buying it and supply might increase a little you're still in a position where there's not enough supply to meet demand there's also a few other things going on which i think are worth mentioning this is from the benchmark mineral intelligence report the price of battery grade lithium cabinet shot up by 300 to nearly 30 000 per ton prices are expected to continue rising these of course will be passed on to the car makers when it comes to battery electric vehicles anywhere and therefore customers these are expected to affect prices for the next two years until 2024 so that alone is going to make a difference if by the end of 2021 prices have gone up 300 percent on the key component for evs it's going to have an effect it will either maintain the price as they are now or or it will go up either way it's not going down so that's one thing another bit of evidence that i've managed to find is the magnesium apparently shortage most of that comes from china of course what doesn't and they ordered 35 of their 50 aluminium smelters to close in october due to the energy prices now magnesium apparently is uh key to making aluminium or if you're in america aluminum because you've missed out the second eye either way if aluminium is going up and again once it hits the supply chain there's a lot of aluminium in the modern car not just evs any car so again that points to a price increase or at least it's going to stay where it is rather than is going back down again prices of cobalt apparently has gone up uh significantly although most manufacturers are trying to reduce that or get rid of it and so maybe that will have too much of an effect but again it points to north the price is only going one way another thing that i think is going to will follow tesla's lead in this case is quite a few manufacturers are liking the direct sales model or at least all you have to offer this online effectively the price they put on the website is the price you pay you might collect it from the dealer but ultimately it's buying a tesla it's that price there's no haggling it's just a purchase anything else there's no kind of batter anymore and i think a lot of manufacturers kind of leaning towards that i know kia did it with the energy still doing it obviously tesla do it i think the ford mustang mac e was online only although you did collect it at a dealer so it won't surprise me if that happens a lot more and if it does of course the price is the price another thing which unfortunately is going to make it difficult for consumers is the ev grant recently went from two and a half to one and a half thousand pounds now we don't expect that to change anytime soon but at some point during 2022 probably in the last half maybe the last quarter it's going to come down again or maybe probably just disappear i can't imagine they're going to go from 1500 to 500 for example i imagine it's just going to be gone so if that happens alone let alone what i've said the price of all evs below 32 grand anyway suddenly jump by 1500 pounds so all indications effectively from what i've found online and the research and the people i've spoken to effectively saying it's not going to get much better and it probably won't in 2023 either price wise again i'm not talking about the list i'm talking about achievable prices let me give you a couple of examples six seven months ago i sent a price for the id3 to somebody uh it was from drive the deal and they ordered two it's for the business they're not obsessed with volkswagens and uh they paid 23 and a half thousand pounds for the effectively the base model id3 50 odd kilowatt hour i think it was 23.5 brilliant price from the same place drive the deal the same spec and battery sign it's basically the same car 30 grand just shy of 30 000 pounds same car same place it was 23 and a half and now 30. even if you factor in the grand change that's a massive increase and it's not because the list price has gone up the list price is actually 32 ish so the price you've got now is still lower than list it's just why discount something when you can't meet supply cap meet demand rather not supply it's not a buyer's market and therefore if they don't want to sell you something at a discount price they don't have to i wouldn't last august i think it was the last two weeks of august so just before the plate change managed to find three vauxhall course at ease for 21 and a half thousand pounds it was on auto trader all from the same foxhole dealership presumably they needed to hit some sort of sales target because it was just before the pla the new plate came in again same place auto trader same car cheapest i can find around 26 000 now so again it's it's looking a bad time to buy when you look at last year but it's not going down again energy prices transport prices all gone up it's all gonna have an effect which affects the consumer in the end yeah they've got to pass on these costs to somebody and well there you go so uh my advice to myself and anyone listening to this would be if you've decided to get one if you've got the finances in place you might as well order it sooner rather than where if you wait let's say six months just to see what happens price wise it will probably be more expensive might be the same probably more so therefore it's cost you more money by waiting again don't panic don't rush into this i think you know in the first quarter of this year it's pretty much february now it's going to be the same i don't think we're going to see a massive increase but again the fact it's not going down why where what are you waiting for if you have to wait for saving up for a deposit or something then clearly you have to wait unfortunately if the car goes up as much as your deposit that you're saving over the next six months or so is then you're constantly chasing your tail i know a few people that aren't ready to get a car yet but they've ordered it because there's a six month lead time so in that six month they've got enough time to save up for the finance or whatever is the need to get the car so yeah it's uh it's a crap time compared to last year it really is i mean this car i bought this two years ago for 40 300 i think just over 40 grand and it's now 43 that ain't coming back down anytime soon if at all so um if i'd have waited it cost me a lot of money and i think that's the position we're in well not just tvs in cars in general but concentrating on evs obviously with the they're only going up in use prices because of the new car supply issues have shot through the roof as well so it's a bad time to buy us a used car it's not all this price don't just concentrate on that and for the love of god do your research don't just go to the same dealership that's closest to you and go what's your best price ring around 10. i've run 10 before i bought our uh the mini in fact well any car i've bought other than this because obviously this was online i've run loads and so eventually you will find one that's going you know what uh i've got one that you can have right now but you have to tell me now and this is the price and i did and saved a fortune that's how i bought the first leaf in fact it boggles my mind how people will just go to the convenient dealership pay whatever they say i mean we're talking probably four figure savings i know somebody that could have saved two and a half thousand pounds on the car they bought just by bringing a few other dealerships around that we're doing a better offer well well no i don't buying cars he said faf you have to visit the dealer and talk to them and i don't doing that if i give you two grand to go and buy a car for me and do all the haggling i think you'd snap my hand off people that cannot complain they haven't got any money if they are truly that lazy to not save that much money anyway that's me that's the auction in me speaking um and that's my theory that's my prediction if you're gonna buy one might as well do it sooner rather than later because prices are going one way okay that's pretty much it uh you might be able to tell that this is one of those not got a lot of time to film stuff so do it on the way to work uh let me know what you think are you buying an ev this year is this changing your mind anything let's let's pull the resources if you've found anything that does predict the prices of uh cars this year 2022 then again put it in the comments section for all to see because i'm not saying i'm definitely right on this but i am quite confident unfortunately right become a member if you can afford the 99b uh you'll get extra videos you'll get videos early and uh well it's 99p isn't it well what can you get for 99p these days other than great content right okay i'm going thanks for watching see you soon,1
Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK3qIOtZKVv68oiQbgtv6AVK,u2XjcI3wa0w,hello and welcome back to the i'm avm this is kind of a back to the basics that i've not done for quite a while actually where i'm basically trying to help someone who's getting into an ev people who are looking into it for the first time this is about charges so if you're lucky enough to be able to get a charger at your house if you're off-road parking for example then we're going to look at the question of whether or not you should go tethered or untethered yes very exciting now i think the first place to start is what is tethered what is untethered starting with my charger which is tethered it's very straightforward essentially this is the box the charger and the cable isn't designed to be removed it is tethered to the charger it's hardwired essentially you've got the plug on the end and you just well plug this into your car so you always have a cable there you always have a plug ready to go into the car it's tethered so that's what that is this is an untethered but we're missing something what are you doing here yes i've got to borrow your house i'm afraid this is harry's new charger it's amazing easy one how small it is um and how often do you charge your uh audi s1 using this every day every day that's brilliant i've got the ev yet we've got the charger no i couldn't find the eevee um so right effectively untethered is the opposite in the fact that there's no cable physically attached to it just for sucking yeah it's just a socket so if you could pick that cable up for me so you plug that in and then you plug the car in so this is effectively untethered it's a socket wait a tick that looks really well installed it's amazing mine was really well installed i used a nationwide company that installs charge points anywhere in the uk and that's a really good website with lots of choice of charges who did you use to install smart home charge funnily enough smart home judge that's who i used wow that's amazing oh wow so look at that i mean it couldn't be any neater it couldn't be there's no there's no all the cables are hidden behind it where's the cable going it's magic and did it happen swift and effectively i got a phone call and then the very next day they turned up on time on time yep installed with no problems the guy tea and coffee he ties up after himself he tied it up and he was friendly what more could you ask for if you want to look on their website they've got all charges that will be perfect for your ev they've got a lot of comparison charges yeah you've got tethered untethered there's lots of guides on there and they've got something called clarner which means if you can't afford to pay what are now fairly expensive items because the grant's been removed you can get some sort of fights at the cost spread the cost there you go if you get an installation through smart home charge you'll also get 20 pound added to your electric juice card if you don't have one go get one but if you do there you go it's basically just free money right what else we've got to contractually read out i think i should put on the screen here the trust pilot review score put it right here there uh so again thanks for them uh let's let's carry on yeah because i've got tethered you chose untethered yeah they do um after all the choices that you had for me it's better for the house it's untethered it looks neater it looks neater you ain't got coiled cables my neighbors didn't even know that it done yeah because it's it's just very unobtrusive yeah however when you're charging your car on a semi-daily basis having to get the cable in and out in and out will soon become very tiring which is why i went for tethered so all i do is pick up a cable plug it in that's one operation i think if you are charging on a daily basis or every other day i would have gone for uh maybe looked at a tethered you're plugging one thing in with this you're plugging one two things in yeah i mean it doesn't sound a lot but when it's middle of the window and it's chucking it down getting your cable out of the boots a bit of a pin well the thing is if you've got a boot full so you've got a pram in there so you're gonna have to make sure it doesn't always on top of the front also the cable effectively i would say that the convenience is with tethered i would say so yeah especially and that's what the nearly seven years of eb driving has taught me because i plug my car in a lot and i want that to be convenient in all weathers over the aesthetics of the charger however i couldn't understand why people would pick that this one in particular you can lock your cable to it yes so it's almost a tethered and untethered and i think it is the only one it's the easy one um so you can lock this in even if your car isn't plugged in because normally it's you have to i would say one disadvantage of that if someone is intent on nicking the cable not only have they got your cable they've knackered you charge you as well well i'll tell you all let's mention that because anyone can steal anything a tethered charger can only be physically cooked so they're taking your cable and presumably weighing it in it's going to be pretty worthless i mean yeah they might do it but i don't think they'll get in they'll get pennies so whereas a cable a complete cable such as this yeah that's got to be a hundred quid on ebay or gum tree or whatever exactly so if they're thinking i can steal a full product yeah all you have to do is get it out of here yeah i mean we've had this in our in our normal work environment have we over the last couple of decades lots of schools because working schools in i.t got lots of projectors they did and projectors were very much targeted very much stolen so then lots of schools started to get projected cages they did and what happened then once they protected their projectors well what you do is uh joe bill is it bill uh i thought i'll start that again so what you had you had burglar bill coming into the school and then just swinging on the projector cage and pulling the roof down so essentially to get to the projector they did so much damage to the roof that it was pointless schools then stopped putting projector gates it cost so much to fix the roof that it'd been better for them just to leave the projector outside the school and i mean i should point out it's gonna be very rare that anybody does this i think i've not heard a single person have their cable taken cut or anything i've seen public chargers do it when they get ultra common oh yeah as in everyone's got a charge normally you know what it's gonna be targeted more i think it's gonna be one of those things where you know sometimes you get people walking around at night checking car doors going through your glove box they see a cable dangling out of a charger but it's sellable yeah you know even if it's 50 grand damaged it's more vulnerable tethered sorry untethered this is i would say it's more vulnerable uh i mean the fact you can lock it in there is brilliant but i don't think you're going to secure it in the same way as a tethered and also a tethered isn't going to have the resale of a non-technical so there's a bit of a disincentive for people to take yeah to steal it essentially though if someone's going to nick some cable yeah and knick some cable yes but i do that the idea that they've done here where you can't create a tethered or intended because it gives you if i was selling a charge point if we were making this i'd be hang on a minute because they can get any length of cable yeah any type of cable you know type one type two so i'm 100 of the market could buy my product but but does it mean two cables do you need a cable to be stuck in there permanently and one in your boot for when you forget the cable that's stuck in there permanently that is a point and not every car comes with the type two cable as well no the bar only came with a type 2 cable right so essentially it might increase cost because you might have to you might want a second cable i mean i don't i do very little type 2 charging no it's public network but i'd put a free pin yeah but the the day would come when it where you go right we're all packed here for holiday or we've gone away oh no it's plugged into my house still i ain't got my cable with me so what am i gonna do i'm gonna have to find a rapid yeah so should we see a massive benefit of untethered if you need more than uh well most tethered come with five meters but some have options of seven or ten meters yeah if you need longer than ten meters you have to get that and then buy your own cable we're being interrupted by um harry's lion oh believe it or not that's a cat they also go down oh i didn't want to be in it it's not call me he likes to be so if you need longer than 10 meters you have to get untethered if you do well again i don't see a situation where you're gonna need more than 10 meters because surely you'd put your charger where your car's charging i guess if you've got this here unless you had some really bizarre sort of a long driveway the earl of essex yes put it at the end of my driveway i mean a lot of quite a few people have made this mistake i think where they bought the charger you start off with the nissan leaf years ago i had a nissan leaf the charge points on the front yeah so you drive into your driveway so you think oh that'll do i'll put it there i can easily reach yeah and then you get another car where the charge parts on the back and you might have to drive in for whatever reason but basically all of a sudden the charge cable has to reach around the other side so you really do need to think about where we'll put in the charger can you reach everywhere not having an ev was one of the reasons i got one where i could change the cable if needs been yes because when i get one i don't know well they're all type two but you say it could be anywhere yeah my it nerd brain would say that this the flexibility of this would give me all options so i would go for that but then when you live with it yeah i would go with tethered because it is so much more convenient my cable stays in my car rather than into the charger it's just the thing above me though is just the cable management of it well yes you don't want to pick that up if we've got audio cables tangling everyone so we're good are we we're really good professional so this would have to go somewhere that wouldn't it you'd have a hook down here yeah maybe around the side yeah but i know a lot of people that wouldn't be happy with that permanently on the outside of their car however however you probably might be more happy with that than having to get out your boot every single time you chat i think so yeah i think the thing that will bug me having to get out all the time is just how dirty that will get in the van of a grime and stuff on the floor would it increase the wear and tear because you're plugging the cable in at both ends to the point where what lasts as long i guess there are people out there because the the nissan leaf the first one anywhere the kia soul first gen and a couple of uh i think the ion and one yeah had type one cables but for the last three four five years ish i think all of them are type two so there's no the majority of people are gonna be type two are they and if it came to it and someone visited me with a nissan leaf i'd just use a sleeping plug socket you know i'm not going to get a charger for the occasional visitor no no i'm basing it on what i need what not well exactly you've got to use basically what you're going to be doing 99 of the time yeah it's more expensive i think as well to buy a separate charger and cable it will be than it is a tethered one the cable's that cheap but if you're using the cable that came with your car then it could be cheaper yeah let's go for the con of the tethered one i've got home yeah obviously you can't take it with you but most people would have type 2 with the car anyway yeah that's that i'm not seeing that as a con i guess if something happens to the cable do you have to replace the charge point i know you can you can rewire even a tethered one i bet you could get so you need electricity well yeah you can replace your cable yourself with an untethered and the chance of that happening i don't think the cost of an electrician in the new cable is going to be enough to make you want to possibly having cable length but i guess you'd have to be an absolute muppet wouldn't you to get i could give us just one half metres i think five meters is the minimum yeah i do know someone that that they said it just reaches their car did you not when you were spending what is hundreds of pounds possibly over a thousand pounds depending on the point do your research get it did you get your tape measure out yeah think about where you're going to put the charge points in relation to where the charger is on any car i mean we had quite a long drive in this last house five meters want to cut it because it wasn't you know you could fit two cars you'd have to put it in your garage wouldn't you the charger probably well most people i think would detach it to the house because it's cheaper to install when it's going to the house because you see if you're going to have to put a cable underneath the ground to wherever the charge point is the main advice is you've got to think about it yeah what is best for us will we ever charge a type 1 car no or do i care about people that turn up and have a type 1 car no so therefore i don't need to worry about that do i need to change the cable length of my charger no once you've got it the longest you don't need to change it at all are you bothered about the cable being there it's going to be there anywhere though wouldn't it i think because you're either going to lock it in or oh the pussycat's back you're either going to lock it in at you yeah or uh in and out of your garage car on a daily basis which is going to be very tiring very quickly i mean i've done a twitter poll actually so we've seen what twitter think of whether would you buy would you buy a tethered or untethered now let me just get before 68 of people would go for tethered wow so 32 obviously would go for untethered and 10 didn't know the conclusion to this is it's up to you yeah that's really bad wow that's the best advice yeah yeah yeah yeah do you think we'll give that to us you cannot make a bad decision as long as you do your planning and have a really good think about it i think you've also got to put in your head living with the car yeah on a daily basis on a daily basis so i mean the trouble is most people and we've said this very much get the charge point before the car turns up yeah the thing is people don't know what it's to live with i think it's the same with baby stuff the amount of oh god i bought everything yeah yeah yeah yeah you've never used that ever on ebay you know six months later yeah i think probably have the car and then get the charger for those that are unfamiliar with evs public chargers are typically untethered i'm talking fast charges now ac ones because you take your own cable which is why you have your own cable in the car rapid charges the ones that you see at services you know the big massive ones that do 50 to 300 kilowatts they're all tethered because quite frankly besides those cables you don't want people using their own cables when potentially 300 kilowatts yeah energy is going through it and they're the ones that i have seen being targeted by thieves literally cut them off but they were the that's the massive they're probably worth their while i guess so in terms of thievery i have done a on this in the past about whether someone will steal your electricity we've obviously mentioned whether someone's going to steal your cable or charge point already but i think we just need to dab into the stone stealing your electric keys it comes up a lot electric version of bilking pretty much yes now it won't happen okay or rather if anyone does it they'll only do it once as a stupid thief because think about it at its max output seven kilowatt i know there are losses blah blah blah but let's even it out first so you get set to make it easy seven kilowatt times thirty p is it at the moment yeah during the day very expensive so that's what seven five two pound two pound tennis let's call it two pound twenty to be on the safe side two pound twenty an hour is what it would cost you so do you really think that a thief is gonna drive a car an ev yeah an electric car pack on your drive for two pound ten an hour saving yeah it's gonna be yeah did you go to work today i love no no what i did do i got a full charge and most chargers this one the easy one the easy one's got an app hasn't it yeah i get a push notification whenever that starts charging i can see them using someone's stolen card to get a rapid charge for free but at home i really wouldn't worry about it no no no um so anything more in terms of tethered untethered that you think is worth mentioning because for me again let's let's reiterate down to personal needs yep tethered is more convenient it is probably cheaper depending on whether your car came i think it's going to be cheaper isn't it you get to keep the cable in your car as well yes you won't ever be stranded by going oops i've left my cable in there as opposed to in the car which i think is where it would live most of the time yeah however untethered if you need the extra length you don't have a choice you could buy your own cable you can get a 15 meter one i imagine if you've got an older car if you need type one and type two ultimately tethered is the one i would pick you picked that because it suits you yeah why don't chad's on daily basis we just basically spent what 10 15 minutes maybe more of your time telling you that you need to do all the work yourself at the end of all this yeah you've just gotten another not none of the clients i'm the wiser thank you for smart home charge thank you very much sponsoring the it does help it absolutely does because i wouldn't be doing this if you want for sponsorships quite frankly um and thank you to you guys for watching and a bigger thank you because the more important the members that pay 99. they get videos a week early and unique members only videos the one i've just put up a few days ago perhaps maybe wow the goodwood the goodwood that is for members only ah you'll never get on this will they no if you want to watch my mum ev grandma ah critiquing an ev6 oh yeah yeah yeah well worth a while anyway even i have to pay i think we're done yeah thank you good night good morning good evening yeah all that sort of stuff as well podcast yeah we're doing the podcast but we've been saying that for two weeks now we start finished i think we're going to try and do one tonight yeah again so that might be driving um maybe not tonight though that might be when you are watching it two weeks ago bye you,1
Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK3qIOtZKVv68oiQbgtv6AVK,mMNHrP9LS68,hello welcome back to the guys i'm ivm and this is responding to a lot of comments over the last few months about these things home charge points i often do videos that answer questions that are always been asked at the time because clearly people want to know about them now in june of this year 2022 the government brought in legislation four home charge points which means by law they have to have certain smart functions and features and various things i'll tell you about in a minute um otherwise you're not allowed to use them essentially so it's new legislation to mean that they have to have certain functions and features now if you're of the ilk that believes that the world governments have pulled the wool over our eyes and we all don't live on a nice flat plane of land uh then you may be worried about this you may be thinking a minute the government can turn this off remotely or the utility companies or somebody the illuminati can take control of my charge point then you may be worried it's the same as smart meters at home i get people telling me all the time that it's not there for any purposes of saving energy smart meters are here to spy on us to tell the utility companies and therefore the government that they can control us by knowing when we turn the tv on by knowing when we turn a light switch on and in what room they can even use the smart meter to tell when your wife's getting in the shower no that's for members only so in that vein i'm going to look at the legislation about these charge points and what they can and can't do and why ultimately it's come about just to tell you that i think everything's fine you can relax or can you now before i delve into these depths i just want to tell you about the illuminati that installed my charge point they're called smart home charge i got them to install this before any sponsorship started they've been a long time sponsor of the so a big thank you to them for keeping this going they've got a great website that tells you all about well pretty much anything really they've got blogs about ev stuff blogs about charging public charging they've got comparison for ev tariffs they've got comparison for public charging if you get something from them because they sell cables as well there's a referral code i'll put in the description below which means you get some money towards public charging using your electric juice card that is a good thing at the moment given the price of electricity i should point out i don't get anything for these referrals it's all yours so if you do get something from smarthomecharge.cod.uk use the link in the description below and enjoy some free money for charging i should point out the smart home charger not in any way related to the illuminati that are responsible for what i'm about to tell you probably maybe i don't know now because i have such a brilliant memory i'm not at all using my phone about the four main things that the legislation by law is bringing in two charge points before that though if you install your own commando socket and this is something i've asked quite a few people and they can't really give me an answer does that count as a charger because as i said you can get a commando socket and then just an adapter for an ev so i guess that could bypass this legislation but i'm not sure feel free to uh put in the comments if you know the answer to that uh so what i've as i said four main things that brought in and why have they brought them in data and connectivity is the first thing so before you could install essentially just a plug if you want or a dumb charger and you plug it in and it just starts charging sometimes the car could dictate when that happens but essentially it was just a plug well one of these things that you have on your walls so this essentially means that all new charge bytes must have data connection now with the ability to measure record and transmit usage in minutes and as units of energy and delay charging or slow it down during periods where grid demand is highest this needs to be able to send data to the cloud to whoever maybe the illuminati um so if there is a grid under demand they can just do a little bit tweaking and then the grid relaxes now that doesn't mean that they're going to turn everything off that's not how the grid works and for that i think i'll need to explain on the whiteboard of truth so the legislation is broke up into as i said four parts the data connection is one of them the next one is off-peak charging we also have staggered charge times and additional security i'll mention later on so let me concentrate on the delayed um charge times or stagger charge times and the off peak charging so this is a very crude diagram or graph of the uk power grid usage during the typical day 6 a.m midday 6 p.m up to midnight uh and this is total grid capacity so 100 basically that's the most the grid can give us and don't worry about the accuracy of this graph too much i'm just trying to get a point across so so yeah it might not be that accurate but again it's enough to to say what i'm going to say so let's concentrate on the off-peak charging first why would you want cars or electric cars to charge during the off-peak period why would that make any sense and this also answers the question to people who says we need lots of power generation to power all these electric vehicles because not really understanding that on how the grid operates if everybody charged their car here then yes we would need a lot more power generation but that's the whole point of this legislation to make smarter use of what we already have rather than just be really inefficient and just pile more on get lots more power generation so let me just walk you through this this is how much energy the power grid is is demanding or providing at any one time so during the night as you can see it's very low people are asleep industry is for the most part shut down then you've got a bit of a peak in the morning you've got more usage during the day again because people are at work and then you get a big spike in the evening when people are going home cooking tea all that sort of stuff and then it drops back down again because people end up going back to bed at some point again don't worry about the accuracy of it too much again it's just here to highlight a point so this whole power generation this 100 maximum power generation that we have is just for this peak that's all we need it for it's just because when people go home the need to use a lot more electricity so the rest of the day this is just unused capacity if we had a big spike here it wouldn't change how many power stations we needed because you're still not going above the 100 percent so let's make all charges by default use off-peak charging and that's what this legislation means that when you get out the box essentially it will by default charge it off peak times because there's lots of capacity at those periods it will not mean we need any more power stations as i said if we did charge there then that would mean that this spike would go up here and then we would yes we would need battle more power stations the daily mail is correct we would need more than we have now but that again is very inefficient what we want is to make use of all this space here because then again the amount of power stations we have won't change it just means that they'll be on more often during the day there's also off peak tariffs i'm on one i have been for many many years and that means that i charge my car it's roughly about this period here and that's when there's a lot of capacity and not much use so i pay seven and a half pence per kilowatt hour as of today so that's today's rates that anybody can get i don't charge here i don't charge here i don't charge here or there because it would be 38 or 38.5 per kilowatt hour so i naturally choose this period because it's cheaper for me i save money and that's what people will do they will naturally choose what saves them a ton of money that's how an electric car for me is i would say roughly 10 of the cost in terms of fuel than petrol or diesel so by default the chargers will do this even if you're not on a time of day tariff because the grid prefers it even if your wallet will not be affected by it even if i plug my car in here smack banging the peak it won't start charging until here so it's all automated now let me be very clear on this one all the settings i've just told you and i'm going to tell you for the rest of this you can override these you can change them you can turn them off you can do what you want to do this will not mean that you come out to work on the morning and think oh hang on a minute why isn't it charged all this legislation is irrelevant if you want to do your own thing it just means that for those that never fiddle with the settings and there are a lot of people out there that will just get a charger and leave it as that it will automatically pick the best times for them because people naturally won't do that so that's what off-peak charging is and why it's a good thing so what about delayed charging why is delaying charging starting times a good thing why would i want that there's something called inertia in terms of power generation i'm not going to go into it too much because most people couldn't care less quite frankly but the best example of this is remember the stories that used to happen all the time not so much now that when we only had three or four channels on tv yes i do remember those days long before the internet and 5 even before 4 when millions of people would watch coronation street or emmerdale and then the grid would know when the adverts were on because there would be a peak because people would be turning the kettle on to during the breaks the biggest example is during something a world cup match during half time there will be a significant peak because again right half time let's go get a cup of tea or coffee or whatever kells would go on and demand would suddenly skyrocket a grid would want a gradual increase it doesn't want demand to suddenly go boom and this is something that they figured out during the electric nation trials if everybody was charging let's imagine they're on octopus go which i think is half past 12 to half past four in the morning so it's a good time but if everybody had that tower if ever everybody told their charger to charge between f12 and r4 that means all of a sudden lots and lots of cars will turn on at half past 12 in terms of charging and then the grid would go from this to a sudden massive quick spike before it does that and it goes back down again we don't want a massive sudden spike what we want is just a gentle curve because that's a terrible drawing [laughter] i'm such a child what we want is again cast to come on bit by bit so part of this legislation of the delayed charging means that they can delay the charging by if they really need to by up to half an hour but usually about 10 minutes so rather than have a million cars come on at half past midnight you'd have some come on at half past 12. swim come on at 12 31 some come on at 12 32 it would randomize the charge time so we'll get a big massive peak we will just get a more gradual curve over the period of five or ten minutes rather than instantly on once off peak charging becomes more and more common and of course it will do because they're putting all the charges to do that and then people will naturally pick the cheapest time for them to charge then again we've got to manage this a bit but how can you manage something that's controlled by people themselves i doubt many people will go you know what to help the grid out i'll start mine charging at 12 33 or 12 37 they'll just pick 12 30 because why not especially as most chargers will work on half hour blocks by giving them just a little bit of control which you can override that means that the grid won't suffer as much it won't go oh crap for a few minutes before then it catches up with itself that's how you get little kind of brownouts or blackouts when there's a certain demand that it hasn't quite met it hasn't ramped it up it's going to the toilet in the middle of the night and you turn the light on too bright too bright if that light could just come on really gently and just get a bit brighter that'll be perfect and that's essentially what this does that's what this legislation again by default can do turn it off can override it if you want to charge during the peak times you can do you know if you're on a weird shift pattern or you just need a bit of extra right now for whatever reason you can do that again it's not stopping anything what you do is kind of irrelevant in some ways to the grid even if you turned everything on your house the grid won't notice but when you've got a million or five million people just using an extra kilowatt right now then the grid will notice so making tiny little changes for everybody has a massive effect on the power grid on the uk as a whole people everybody turning off their their phone chargers you only use 0.1 watt or something but if there are a million charges plugged in it can have a cumulative effect badly drawn diagram aside i think that hopefully shows why this is not a bad thing it's not scary but there's one more thing that's not need to tell you about the final part to this is that all data between the charge point and the people has to be encrypted that's another part of legislation the data the transmission of data has to be encrypted again that seems a sensible option to me and something i'm not really bothered about um so there we have it that's essentially what this charge legislation brings into play and uh i personally have no real issues with this i don't believe the illuminati are going to use its controllers no not as lot of the daily mail commentators will say going to turn us all off when we're charging our vehicles they may do little tweaks here and there which makes sense from a grid scale point of view it is a good idea ultimately from the trials that the electric nation taught them whilst doing charges it's just common sense which is kind of worrying really the government have done something that makes sense that for me is the most worrying part of this whole thing how can it be a little logical for this when they do all the other stuff i mean evs are something that the government are pushing very much and i'm not getting political on this one it doesn't matter who's in charge they're all just as bad as one another but essentially we want to push evs they're the future and to do that we're going to remove grants from charges grants from evs so the poorest people in the country can no longer afford them by an even greater margin now because the grant means that they've all gone up in price there are ways it means to do these sort of things of course for me uh means tested grants scotland do not finance for any electric vehicle new or used up to a certain amount it kind of makes sense but no here we are we live in a world that is dominated by idiots and on that subject i want to say thank you for watching this thank you for keeping me alive and you know the illuminati in power i mean um they're coming after me [applause] only kidding i'm not a member of the illuminati thanks for watching guys i'll see you soon

Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK3qIOtZKVv68oiQbgtv6AVK,C8aI4en7Nmk,i've seen people drive clear across town to save one maybe two pence per liter on some petrol but when it comes to changing a driving habit or checking something or turning something off just something simple that can save you considerably more money whether it's electric petrol or diesel again people tend not to do that maybe it's because they're not aware of it they didn't know it was a thing or they didn't know it was more efficient to do this instead of that that's what essentially this is about to give you my eight nine years of ev experience and test driving pretty much everyone in existence to say well this is how to get the most out of it i've got a lot of comments recently from people asking how i'm getting so much efficiency out of this car or another car or a press car and they've got the same one and it's it's just miles apart and it's not a car fault i don't think it's anything to do with that i think it's just a case of change a few things and it can make a big difference one thing that can make a huge difference to an electric car anyway is having somewhere to charge at home that's a huge contentious issue because some have it some don't it's roughly 50% of the uk households can charge from home but to be able charge from home you'd need a home charge point and for that you need a home charge installer such as these guys now if i needed a home charger they installed mine would be getting one from smarthome charge. co.uk they have a huge array of chargers you can scroll down the list there's ton of them you've got a comparison tool so you tell them what car you've got and they will pick the best one for your particular vehicle they've got loads of accessories cables different lengths if you need public charging type two for example they've got all that you can pay in full you can pay in monthly installments and you've got all options i've had mine installed by them my brothers harry's all by smart home charge and it's been faultless check their trust pilot score and thank them for sponsoring this so it's that's smome charge. co.uk a lot of what i'm about to tell you is probably going to be obvious to quite a lot of people it should be fairly straightforward but there are some ev specific things in this that well it might help you out it might make things more efficiently cuz i am seeing a lot of uh misconceptions out there from new ev drivers because it is slightly different from driving a petrol or diesel car but again a lot of what i'm saying will apply to any vehicle whether it's petrol diesel or electric powered the first one is one that i'm in the wrong place for for that i need to be outside the car it's tire pressures something that everybody should be aware of and due to the inclusion of tire pressure sensors and even the cheapest cars these days i think it's something that made people a little bit lazy me included but for me they're a backup at best they to tell you if there's a slow puncher or a puncher in general a backup a warning whatever you want to call it they're not there for what we're trying to achieve in this and that's optimal tire pressures now the savings aren't massive on this one if you're 10% too low for example you meant to be at 40 psi but you're at 36 then you're probably only going to save about maybe two 3% in terms of fuel costs in any car by having the correct tire pressures but there's another saving which i think is worth len into more than that and that's for every 10% too low the tire pressure is you will increase the tires where by up to an around 10% now obviously there's many variables in this and many different cars many different tires that will change that reading but essentially if they're not right the tire will not last as long and these are bloody expensive these days so little bit of fuel saving possibly a little bit of tire savings as well is worth doing and then of course there's the safety aspect that alone should be worth people checking their tire pressures and don't forget about the seasonal change if you last checked yours in august when it was 17° it's minus5 right now the tire pressures will not be optimal at all they would be dangerous but they will be too low because well it's much colder and that changes everything so for me this is a one some month check for safety and then for optimal reasons the next thing that makes probably the biggest change of all is driving style again quite obvious but a lot of people drive a lunatic or drive fast hard acceleration you know quick if you want to do that that's up to you but if we're talking about pure money saving efficiency then that's the biggest easiest thing to change to have the biggest effect on how much it cost cost you if you drive a lunatic if you drive at uh bmw spec motorway speeds for example it's going to cost you more money in any car because it will use more fuel now just to put it into some sort of ev context if i drive down to my parents and back again in the tesla for example when it was summer i did this a few times so i had some good data should we say i got 250 260 miles wow that sounds bright out of an economical journey should we say so over 500 mi i got about 260 from a single charge driving it at uh more audi speeds should we say their run back i got about 200 miles so we're looking at an extra 50 60 mil worth of range and they for less fuel just by driving more economically you don't have to drive a saint or eek out every little bit just change how fast you accelerate change the maximum speed use on a motorway for example again fairly obvious but it makes a huge difference the next one i want to talk about is regen so this is very ev specific and it's something which again i think trips people up certainly when you're you're new to evs for example if you're at 70 m hour on a moto a just driving forwards the level of reg in you're in makes absolutely no difference at all it has no effect on efficiency all it does is it changes what the accelerator pedal does when you lift off it will break hard or it will not break at all depending on what car and what level of regen you've picked so essentially the efficiency of the car doesn't change one jot if you're in a higher level of regen or a lower level level of regen or anywhere in between for me to make it easy for new ev drivers until you get used to them just turn regent off for to its lowest setting whatever your car does because then it's far easier to drive more efficiently than it is with the regen on its highest level this is quite difficult to explain so i'll try my best right now i have no regen activated if you will i'm on my lowest level in this car which means if i take my foot off the accelerator it just curs forward if you will the only speed i lose is from natural causes should we say but if i'm in the highest level of regen be mode in this case then when i take my foot off the accelerator whether i'm going uphill downhill doesn't matter the car breaks not hard but you know quite reasonably hard for reging the reason i say turn it off is because it's very easy to accidentally scrub off more speed especially when you're on a long journey or a faster journey by taking your foot off the accelerator because something's happened in front of you the regen slows you down quite you know harshly and all of a sudden you're doing 60 mph instead of 70 but you didn't really want to do that so then you have to accelerate back up to 70 m per hour that will use considerably more energy getting back up to speed than the regen will ever give you i mean hugely more whereas if i'd have just been in no regen or the lowest setting when i let off my my foot off the accelerator it would have just cured at the same speed it lost very little should we say so what i'm saying is if you want to accelerate that's what the accelerator pedal does if you want to slow down that's what the brake pedal does if you do genuinely want to slow down roundabout or traffic or whatever pressing the brake pedal activates the regen before the friction breaks so you're not losing regen at all by changing the mod it's just changing how the car operates it gives you more regen without asking essentially so again it's easier to accidentally screw up more speed than you want so therefore do what porsche have always done with their electric cars or car the tian they don't have any regen at all they say that the brake pedal does that the accelerator pedal does that so when you let off there it doesn't slow you down at all automatically and some people prefer that don't get me wrong if you got careful enough right foot then you can drive just as efficiently in any mode but it needs more fness it needs more practice so therefore even the most careful driver in the world will probably again occasionally slow down more than the wanted to just to put that into some sort of ev context in my previous previous ev the nissan leaf i did this a few times as a test i drove up a continuous gradient it's about 3 or 4 miles i think it was i can't remember exactly but essentially i used 7% to get to the top of this hill i then turned around and went driving down the hill in regen mode of course so so i'm regenerating power and putting it back into the battery which is good but the ratio of that i think is what people think is a lot different than it actually is for every 7% i used going up to the top of this hill i got about one and a half% back via regen so if we go off that ratio and every ev will be different there's many variables 1 and a half to s it's very poor keeping a speed especially again on more on a long journey than in town driving is key maintaining that speed every time you slowed down when you didn't want to or mean to you have to use a lot more energy getting back up to speed again another thing which a lot of people again i think get quite wrong um that are new or have just never driven an ev is using things heating and air conditioning now i'm not going to suggest turning them off to save fuel that's ridiculous it's a car you want to be comfortable and without it it's kind of pointless having it i don't prescribe to that unless you absolutely have to however if you are on a faster journey a longer journey you're on a motor we dual carriageway something that it is more efficient to use the air conditioning than it is to put your window down to cool yourself down so if it's too hot all right around town but on a motorway windows up air conditioning on the heater now this again is something which a lot of people who don't electric vehicles seem to think is a negative that when you use the heater you use a lot of range and it indeed does use range whether you see that as a lot or not is im material you lose battery because that's where the heat comes from it comes from your battery the main traction battery look at it this way with a petrol diesel car that is always producing a huge amount of heat so you think you're getting heat free because you just turn the heater on it doesn't affect miles per gallon but you're not because the engine is constantly losing a huge amount of heat and energy and burning all that petrol or diesel to just heat up well the atmosphere i guess i mean that's why they need huge radiators to cool them down otherwise they would literally go bl so an ev only loses heat when you call for it a petrol diesel car loses heat every single journey it could be 40° centigrade outside and the engine is still producing a tremendous amount of heat you don't want that is wasteful obviously doesn't affect this in terms of how do i use less but one little tip i do have if i put this on auto and it gives it at 20 dees for example just stick it down to 19 and 1 half or even 19 i bet 90% of people watching this won't notice any difference of the internal temperature but that one degree it can make enough of a difference to use a little bit less energy we're not talking huge savings here but enough to add to the mix so to speak and one thing that i wish a lot of people would do more of and this does have a substantial difference on fuel efficiency is forward planning if you don't believe me on this one just watch any uk dash cam and you'll know exactly what i mean essentially if you're coming up to a set of traffic lights that are red don't race up to them and then break hard and sit there stationary and then move off you'll sometimes get it wrong but basically try and drive up to it gently and then wait until it turns green and then you can just keep going basically try to do it so you don't stop the car stoping the car and starting again stop in the car and starting again in any car is inefficient so try and do it less for example if you can up to a set of traffic lights you we say certainly after a a dual carriageway or a motorway off a slip road something yeah high speed if you can see they're red then well slow down try and keep going try and keep that momentum going so you time it so just as you approach the traffic or the lights they go green that's the hard bit predicting it and obviously if you're familiar with the road that helps but essentially not stopping will save you a good wedge of fuel and therefore money so many times you see people flying past you to just stop quickly so you can see they can see it's red just the same as you can and they accelerate past you into stationary traffic so not only are you using more of your brake paths for example you're wearing them down quicker why have you accelerated into essentially a dead end it makes no sense it's not got you any further you're not getting in there any quicker it's bonkers i mean a lot of what of them saying the forward planning is really from a safety perspective it's better again just look at the dash cam stuff it's just you can see what's coming but they can another ev specific thing which again can help with efficiency on the journey at least is preheating the car now not every car can do this but the majority can certainly the newer ones these days where you get your phone out and you press the you know heater on the app you you preheat the car and a lot of those will also heat up the battery the difference being in terms of efficiency if you plugged into a charge point whether it's at home home or anywhere else the electricity or fuel can come from the charge point rather than depleting the battery first so you're setting off with a near dam it full battery but the car's already up to temperature so you're not scraping it down in winter which is a brilliant thing and the battery is warmer as well therefore will operate more efficiently and use less fuel a petrol or diesel car when they're cold they use more so to summarize forward planning tire pressures weight i didn't mention that actually but any unnecessary way out of the car how you drive the driving style that's a huge one if you just drive more sedately or h to slightly lower speed on the motorway that will have a big difference you've also got the air conditioning instead of using your windows down that can make a little bit of a difference but not a huge amount the regen thing there'll be people in the comments saying i use the highest level all the time because i prefer one pedal driving and that's fine but in pure terms of efficiency and the ease of getting that efficiency out of the car for me stick it to its lowest setting because then again you're not screwing off speed accidentally and using a hell of a lot more energy to get back up to speed right uh i think that's it again a lot of this will be fairly obvious to a lot of people some of it may not be but that's you know if one person gets something out of this my job is done uh so thank you for watching thank you for the existing because if you didn't it wouldn't if you want to help the out at all become a member that's 99p a month you get vide on sunday instead of friday and occasionally live streams there's also the behind the scenes

Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK3qIOtZKVv68oiQbgtv6AVK,89BGXSE_1zc,"the most common questions i get from people are from those that are new to evs or about to get into one so that's essentially what this is about it's a basics basics beginner's guide for what kilowatts kilowatt hours how to figure out how much it's costing you to charge why don't you get the speeds at the rapid charges that you should get essentially again the basics of ev ownership so hopefully it will help and ease you into what is well it's just a car at the end of the day it's just slightly different slightly unfamiliar you one of the first things that you need is an ev owner is a reliable home charger if you're lucky enough to be able to get one and for that you need a reliable home charge installer i think i know of one now if i needed a home charger they installed mine would be getting one from smome charge. co.uk they have a huge array of charges you can scroll down the list there's ton of them you've got a comparison tool so you tell them what car you've got and they will pick the best one for your particular vehicle they've got loads of accessories cables different links if you need public charging type two for example they've got all that you can pay in full you can pay in monthly installments and you've got all options i've had mine installed by them my brothers harry's all by smart home charge and it's been faultless check their trust pilot score and thank them for sponsoring this so that's smome charge. co.uk the whiteboard of truth has been brought back to life back to reality just as soul to soul prophesized and i think this is the easiest way for me to explain what's going on so kilowatts kilowatt hours let's start with that kilowatts is a unit of power kilow hours is a unit of energy let's imagine you just bought an electric and it's got a 50 kwh battery so that's the size of the battery this is something you should at least be familiar with if you've looked into one or you've just bought one you'll know what battery size you have so kilowatts let's start with that now if you have a home charger it's almost certainly in the uk going to be a 7 kilowatt charger there are slower speeds and some people will have three fas but essentially this is by far the most common 7 kow so let's run with this example if you plugged this charger 7 kilowatt charger into your car and it ran exactly 7 kow for 1 hour then it would add 7 kow hours worth of energy per hour it's on charge so 7 kow running for 1 hour adds 7 kow hours worth of power to your battery after 2 hours it would be 14 after 3 hours it will be 21 and so forth and for the purposes of the people jumping up and down in the comment section right now i am ignoring charging losses for the purposes of explaining what this is so that's essentially what kilowatts and kilowatt hours doing ev world that's the speed of the water flowing through the horsep pipe so to speak and that's the kilowatt hours the size of the battery is almost the amount of water the bucket can hold now what if we change the charger so let's imagine you plug into a much faster charger now a rapid charger a 5050 kw one so we are now charging at 50 kw in theory if it ran at 50 kw consistently for the entire hour which is unrealistic in the real world but let's run with it then after 1 hour at 50 kw well that car would be full if the battery was flat before you started because at 50 kw for 1 hour you're adding 50 kwatt hours worth of energy to that battery and and that's essentially what a kilowatt and a kilowatt hour means in ev world again i'll come back to charging losses and why you will almost never get the maximum speed out of your car's charger or the rapid chargers anywhere um in the real world so this now hopefully will explain the cost of charging so let's assume you're charging at home so the cost let's say 25 p per kilo out you'll be able to figure this out by looking at your electricity bill and it will say the pence per kilow hour cost on that bill assuming it's static so let's say you're paying 25 p per kilowatt hour of electricity so 25 p you've got a 50 k car let's assume by some miracle it's completely flat it's on zero kilow hour 0% how much would it cost you to fill up that car well it's simple 25 p time 50 because that's the car's battery size is all you have to do so 25 * 50 is 1250 cuz 25p * 50 kwhs is 1250 again i'm ignoring charging losses in this example so if you're on a rapid charg which is a lot more expensive that's the ones the big ones at the service areas it probably won't be 25p it could be 75p so that 12250 which is really badly written there would not be 1250 at all it would be 75 p times 50 which is 3750 so you can see a massive difference there in well refueling cost if you will from flat to full depending on what you're plug in into so at home i pay just 7.5 p i don't pay 75 i pay 7.5 p at night so that will obviously be massively cheaper than charging on a rapid charger at 75p now i should point out some are 50p some are 60p some are 70p somewhere even less than 50p have a look at the price of the charges you're plugging into and then just multiply it by how many kilow hours you add to that car so if you've got i don't know half a battery and you want to fill it up then it would be 25 kil hours times however much they're going to charge you for this electric gives you a rough guesstimate again ignoring losses what about charging speeds though this often trips people up so let me again once wipe this out once more this is the car this is the charger so again we're talking about charging speeds the car that you've just bought or the ones that you're looking at will have a maximum charge speed when it comes to the rapid dc charging so let's imagine that this car can charge a maximum of50 kilow cuz again that's the ch speed that's the water going through the hose pipe so to speak so that's the maximum the car can go at the charger now that obviously will change depending on what you plug into so let's assume that you plug this car into a a really big one a 300 kilowatt charger now the lowest amount dictates how fast you could theoretically go so if you plug your 150 kw maximum car into a 300 kw charger it will not go 150 of course cuz that's the most the car can take and it will work in reverse as well if you plug a let's say 50 kw charger into your car that's capable of doing 150 kw then the most you will get is 50 because that's the most the charger can give you now we'll see this happen quite a lot at services plugging a car into a faster charger doesn't mean the car will charge any faster than it is capable of doing there's nothing wrong with plugging your car into a 300 kilowatt charger as in that's the fastest you can do but you would never go above the car's maximum just you could never go above the chargers maximum if that was lower than this now let's wipe this out again and talk about efficiency miles per kilowatt hour or w hours per mile there's two here in terms of how efficient your car can be miles per kow hour or w hours per mile and i'm sorry anyone in europe this is a uk example i'm keeping this simple let's ignore this for a second this is just telling you the same information in two different ways it's someone saying they weigh x amount in stones or x amount in kilograms they're saying the same thing just in different ways so mounts per kilo hour it's very much the same or it's the ev version if you will as the petrol mouse per gallon so i'm pretty sure everyone should be familiar with this if you said my car does 50 miles per gallon my petrol car or diesel car you will probably know that that means that for every gallon of petrol you use you will get 50 miles from it miles per kilow hour is essentially just that if your ev so my ev is average averaged 4 miles per kilow over the last 60,000 miles so let's use that 4 m per kil 4 * 50 will be 200 mile range because you're getting four miles for every kilowatt hour that that car can give you if you didn't get 4 miles per kilow and you only got 3 m per kil then it would be 3 * 50 which would be 150 m maximum range so that's what miles per kilowatt hour is and this is probably the most common um way of the car displaying how efficient it's running in the uk but some tesla use w hours per mile so let me explain what that one is very briefly because some people will have the most popular ev in europe a tesla so let's stick with what i being gain 4 miles per kil hour the equivalent to that is 250 w hours per mile let me explain this all down to the number 1,000 they say the same thing the way you can convert that to that or that to that is essentially divide by a th000 or rather divide that from a th000 so 1,000 divided by 4 is 250 so now we've just converted miles per kil hour into wat hours per mile so let me explain by reversing it if you wanted to turn that into that 1,00 ided by 250 is four so just remember the 1,000 divide it by whichever figure you want and that will give you the other figure you don't really need to know this if you're just new to evs i just thought i'd explain it because some people will see both figures now i mentioned charging losses earlier on in the now i'm not going to get into technical details on this one but essentially if your charger is putting out 7 kow you won't get 7 kow in your ev there are losses there transmission losses conversion losses i don't need to go into technical detail as i said but essentially you lose a percentage of everything that the charger puts out that actually eventually ends up in the battery to fully charge a completely flat 50 k battery will probably use about 53 54 ks worth of energy there are many variations in this you think hang on a minute i've used 55 ks filling up my 50 k car how is this well it's essentially because of those losses it's having a little leak if you will in the hor pipe just a few drips as it's converting itself as it's going into the car or the bucket in this case so that that's essentially all is i don't want to explain it in any further detail that's for a different entirely now let me very briefly explain why rapid charges will almost never give you the speed that you think you can get so again let's assume you've got a 50 k car and the maximum speed that that car can do in terms of charging is let's say 150 kow so that's the maximum speed that the manufacturer states that that car can take this is a graph of rapid charging and it's technically close enough for this example but again don't jump up or down in the comment section because i've not done it quite right this is the percentage of the battery 0 50% 100% this is the speed of charge so 75 kw 150 kw the faster or the higher it up is the faster the charger is going it will be brilliant if it could plug in a 150 kow car into a 150 kow charger and it just run at 150 kw the entire time which would be something this that would be brilliant but that does not happen in the real world unfortunately cu there are many variables that dictate or can change the speed that that rapid charger will put energy into your car the temperature of your battery that's quite a big one that's why a lot of cars now preheat the battery before they rapid charge because if it's not at the ideal temperature for the battery to rapid charge then it will go slower than your car can actually take sometimes you end up at a charger that can charge two cars at once but have the speed this is quite common in uk service areas if two cars are plugged into the same charger then a 150 kw charger turns into 275 kw charges the higher the state of charge the slower the rapid charge will be the temperature can affect it the uh again if you're sharing a charger so this here if you in a car that's got a very cold battery it might not even go above 75 kow and then we'll just take off near the end as well so that's why it it often catches people out i've seen this a lot at service areas myself where someone's plugging in their car and you say well i can do 150 why am i not getting it into a 150 charger if you're at 75% already you're never going to get the speed that the car's capable of because the higher the state of charge the slower it will be which is why if you are rapid charging unplug at 80 85% this varies on the car because once you get to the top kind of 10 20% the charge rate will be very slow you're actually more efficient doing two 40% charges than one 80% charge depending on the car of course there there are variables just to complicate it even further because that 240% charge will be at the optimum speed so you're doing the charge very fast and then driving and then doing the charge very fast and then driving rather than one long charge that's going to slow right down i mean if i think back to my original nissan leaf it took as long to go from 80% to 100% as it did from 10% to 80% because the charge rate just drops right off and to stop i think this is quite important in terms of charging etiquette to stop blocking a charger if your car has anywhere above certainly 90% or more even if you're not finished eating or whatever move your your car from that rapid charger believe me you will get to the point where you get to a charger and they're full and they'll be some guy on or a girl at 98% clearly finished charging although technically it's still going who's just finishing food or something that you will get annoyed at that stage so don't be that person unplug your car when you've got enough to carry on your journey move it to another spot and then carry on we're talking two three minutes out of your time here it's not biggie but it will increase the throughput of the charges and make things a lot more efficient in this far from perfect charging network that we've got at the moment so uh yeah hopefully that will help if you do want to help the then the members only button it's 99p a month which is what a quarter of a pound at today's rates you get videos on sunday instead of the regular friday upload and there are now members only videos for those that want the extra cander behind the scenes content if you just just want to help any youtube out that you and type a comment effectively because that means that youtube pushes it onto more people which helps the out that's why every single you watch says the same thing so now i've done the sales plug thank you to smart home charge as well for sponsoring the and hopefully that helped someone so if it did help you out then well it'll make your life just a little bit easier all for the sake of a short youtube thank you ever so much for watching and i'll see

you can be internet the fraction closer so i can read the text are you going to test side the vauxhall corsa e if vauxhall give me one but they've they've told me that they're so busy it could be at least october before the psa group even have anything free because of the you know the lockdown something changing how did you find the charger in demand today yes you're obviously the person whose wife uses the free charger near their house cheapskate cheapskate and to charge their i mean they have a tesla model 3 and a brand new mini electric and still won't pay 50 p for electricity almost thinking they're from yorkshire well they could have you got yorkshire blood there's got to be something there this has to be something there what are we drinking harry nothing just i'm drinking beck's i was drinking john smith's and we have or we have cristal school vodka the best vodka you can get maybe later on that we bit of a rush on this which is why i'm using the phone i was probably easier to do it this way perfectly honest we have you cook you love the shirt what mine is i'll do the curtains fine if we can have the curtains at home can everyone here is alright and see just just a double check but i think we should be okay so yes the bed there there is another bedroom we're not topping and tearling have you got solar panels on your house if not would you ever consider getting

mentioned he is you can't drink and drive that's dangerous blue looking again the first tv very good i have a nissan leaf kilowatt-hour 2016 set of health is 72 percent battery firmware is original i understand an update will return some state of health no i just misread the state of health so we may put it back to what the back to state of health is who doesn't increase it it just reports it properly so it may actually put it or get so check it to me sonic's free there's no real reason not to write best star trek episode for your daughter so far oh we're on the elm start season 3 and she does kind of girly stuff you know she kind of likes to counsel the troy anthony oh i don't know she likes worf she's a fan of worf maybe the the one with q and bog where he introduced the bog there you go the geeks will know i'm going on about so i'll skip skip to the next question now feel free to ask anything at all hello to my right my doctor has posted up happy birthday using my ipad so i'm talking to myself it seems so hello elise everybody say hello to evie care and of course evie do believe with the wife i haven't said that she said that doesn't i said the wife i think the i watch it hello lana light of my life beautiful wish you were here oh very much sir which is why we're coming which is why he's drinking he's upset no no i'm we do me high avm and tony say thank you for all your content you were keen persuading me and the wife you get to an eevee fantastic news very good very good any news on 100 kilowatt charger is in the nuke uk will all the ayanna t ones are a lot some of the bp ones are there on the way but everything all take time they're not gonna get rid of the 50s no it's gonna be so that the 50 kilowatts - probably got a 10 15 year shelf life so it's not gonna disobey overnight but there's a massive rollout yeah and i mean we've gone from near me that used to be 19 miles to the nearest rapid charger i've said this in a previous and now a nine month ago now there are about eight within four miles yeah massively different and so looks a storm trooper from the front yes yes it does a bit actually in the black i'm not keen on the red dawn we've got a red roof it is a soul better than the model 3 johnny smith and his wife said that no lying it's comparing an entry yeah and do some cash tied to a bmw 3 series it's a completely different no i mean we prefer the easy road of it yeah yeah definitely and the range is better in the sole but it's got it's got 12 kilowatt hour bigger battery than the model 3 standard range plus so it should do but know that the the model is more efficient cars i prefer fast saloon absolutely the driver is a lot better in the problem compares yeah and it's not quickly than all three as well and the other supercharger network which it's a complete yeah it's part of the ownership isn't it have you seen the list from rich rebuilds are you tempted to add some fake exhaust yeah thomson bangs pop spanking now i'm just gonna get harry to were kind of you're going the boot pops among how about evb i'm evie snl come there's a lots of them but since i got created well yeah why not maybe i should do a break a break a yeah a t-shirt room different get your own custom t-shirt right get my first tv on thursday and e to eight gt probably one of the best looking cars yeah duffing so yeah and you could get discount on them as well already i hope you have door got to drive the deal calm look under the car you just bought and find out how much you could have why fall but i guarantee you that they're definitely good deals out there um what's the best tv on a budget as a friend is looking at v's i'm dizzy on the mort ability scheme it's not on the motability scheme yet as far as or not on the plug-in hybrids are best but well mg it really depends on the use by on you yeah do you need to from the car to you know i would say the mg said the cv is the best value it's a big car as opposed to big cap you might not need to be cat yeah yeah and then probably there's all way all the actual the mini if range isn't a problem for 25 grams same as the other the meaning i saw today is yeah and everyone that everyone thinks that the mini is is fantastic what's your opinion on beam do you plan it to charge a subscription to use hardware already installed in the cat tesla tesla do it yeah yeah i mean basically it's he certainly buying a petrol car they was it the woman for bmw woman for engine is identical to the one twenty one more six months basically it's just different map which restricts the power so this is something's been up and in a long time it's not just about recapping mgz se v is available on mobility accorded to this poster maybe it's changed then so there you go i'm gonna get a few messages here guys cuz they saw me coming through so if you do miss it just positive again what do you think about the vauxhall ampera my wife hit v's because of range anxiety that's got a 60 mile range in its its generates an eye cream okay obviously i think the stop selling several years ago so you know what range anxiety is all relative watch the i did about recently it's only a problem if you if you make ours yeah if you've got more than kind of household symbolic yeah if you don't i understand what you mean but these men to be very good young player apart from the fat it's got a box or badge on the front and back although it's effectively a ship for a live chevy volt or bolt oh it's just a rebound so yeah my mg zenoss is just other software update which get through the most annoying boss you just appear for that yeah did you have to pay for that evb will though i think they wanted 55 or so five pound for a software or play will do it for free right in the first place and they want to charge you for fixing it to just just get straight to the end i follow a guy norway in there 150 cover charges everywhere well we'll get there we'll get there the uk is getting better very quickly to be fair right should make a show called bend do you think electric vehicles should be cheaper than their petrol equivalents now they're fully charged children touched on this the other day should debate it well the cat become there how much it costs to me that's saying should the playstation 5 be cheaper than the playstation 4 it should be should be but yeah i think reality means that if they can charge them awesome and you will buy it who wouldn't do that in any product eventually they'll be marvel actually cows producing it'll switch in use it look at the minute in fact the minute eevee is cheap that's cheaper than the cooper s is based on yeah so some are doing it already do they do it evie mini countryman only a plug-in hybrid which i think the videos in my i've actually tested that one i will test the launch a one million mile battery no one would ever buy a new car if they did well you can do a million miles sort of or you could do hundreds of thousand amounts in the petrol car but lots of people still buy ones you get bored people buy new cars they go on holiday it's not cuz they need it because they want it if it was available in uk would you choose model why over the model 3 if it was the same price maybe but personally i prefer the model three looks i think it looks better the model wines kind of got that tall it's a bit bigger as well as wider and longer yeah obviously toddler but it'll be a few thousand pound deer right i reckon so no may i've got the model free now and to be honest did nothing that's not fit in the cab rob dogs i was about the only thing that would require a hatchback but as i said in the model 3 i'm not gonna do a full tip run in a 40,000 pound car yeah but yeah no you mean no i think the model y has one thing over the three which would make me get it and that's it's got people rather than a resistive heater so in winter it's far more efficient excuse me drink harry just doing the pizzas would you recommend the e 2008 for a disabled driver it's it's all early to it well yeah i guess it depends on how disabled and what there's too many varied variables on that one if you can fit in a what's the equivalent only 2008 yeah only you can answer that unfortunately nissan leaf is on multi bility apparently as well so eby's are on multi bility just got the soil fantastic question if you do on something which we haven't figured out yet but apparently they've got evey mood that have got mood lighting you know with loads of real cool colours but it's not on our car is it not in the uk do you have it on yours convince mg to answer emails oh somebody has donated 10 pound the value the line thing i keep on forgetting every time oh actually no sorry it's 10 euros first off thank you - alexandra set you up i hope you pronounced right so yes big big thank you for that 110 euros that will they'll get a few drinks hey check it out pizza's arrives and we have the chips on them oh chips - wow tell we just got out the car okay wow this is cooking yeah this is what happens when basically you're without the over half don't be in frozen food that's putting a magnet it's vegetable yeah all right let's do some up excuse me looking at egolf would you yes within budget and the range is fine for you it's a golf mmm you can't go wrong it's solid this is familiar hmm and it looks really it looks nice it's cold yeah i do it into a virtual cocktails me there's only the the range that people put people off i think the golf yeah yeah if it's the second kind of household absolutely and i believe there were some pretty heavy discounts is that will run near now cuz it'll tell them anymore because the id3 is coming out or at least they're not making anymore so yeah if you get a good deal and there were some cracking deals so do we be people talk together when charting in p place in uk i'm not sure that one means i'm afraid charging charging yeah yes yeah yeah yeah when we're charging yeah i think so there's a bit of a club still isn't it yeah yeah he's still a quaver a small unique thing really is in an electric vehicle so when you act ivan's friendly enough oh yeah i mean we were talking to the few scottish people as we were charging up yeah we have to really pay attention that your vehicle yes ooh a good safe i thought if they could understand all through the akshar sonique that's a terrible word oppression of a scottish person i do apologise people just left yeah east of along the north coast 500 now open it is for self catering and on the 15th of this month so in four days time everything shops are all open pubs and restaurants ought to be open to take out yeah yeah there's some place all the accommodations stuff will be open by the 15th you what staff no no you're not gonna stop you just yeah say people softer make more need other bought a new zoe 50 thanks are you use thank thank you mister caesar not i'm 49 pronounced lots the guy that donated so yes much appreciated where where are all the charges online in the highlands we've only just got to the highlands sir so far so good even then city electric highway 1 wow 120 pound my brother's dealership once talked at the software by the usb pen on his mg said a cv must be difficult job i think it requires a laptop does it yes when you billy it's enough alone yes enjoy your pizza thank you eb k or maybe my beautiful wife i will have some now if people don't mind it as eating whilst we're doing this talking about 5 to 10 minutes will do the winner announcement of the owe me charger which is when the amount of people watching this will massively drop off well i'm gonna keep your hanging on until the end of it right there's some great deals on nearly new egolf hmm yep yep and it's cold there's a gothic a cool ring it's good it there it's gonna feel very familiar mmm after a final camping trip in this crv in a few weeks i'm trading in for the leaf footage around 9000 but it works stretching that for the 30 level model over the 24 yes it doesn't sound a lot but running of the 24 going to my parents house it was a for probably 5 stops to get there because he only did a bit to drive around well so were those off in the 30 i can do into two stops just for the sake of an extra 15 to a 12 2025 mile range it means longer journeys are considerably easier and you get an 8 year warranty on the battery with a third killer our leaf on your 5 year on the 24th so that long that alone's worth it even if you have to stretch your budget a little bit more right i'm gonna have to scroll through the down the questions oh there's a lot of questions i'm gonna have to skip a few i do apologize will you be doing the knopf course 500 nene on model 3 and your september are the mid she's out we don't seen any which is [ __ ] me gene small people harry no no no but we aren't a lot of walk we all go for a walk or anything and to be honest most of the north coast is on the coast so it's you know you got the sea rather than standing bob excuse me i need to really bert pardon me road trip to norfolk scheduled for the 15th was that see cousin thing how do you get across the border quietly new nitra people yep scaled defense recently seen ione to charge has been installed on the m65 trim so far blackburn susan oh yeah never a bad thing to have more more options what's the best out i find you can't use them the not cost 500 you only need wound which is the charge west scotland one because that operates all of them and that currently free to use is 20 pounds per year for the cards and you can use it as much as you want so you don't need one to take of it i have a 24 kilo our leaf and i still might see long journeys yeah yeah it's possible it's just easier in a 30 obviously it's long again no longer thinking book i said that the warranty extra three years warranty is worth it i think if you're buying a used one especially right what app did you use for charging stations before the car did it for you the cows not doing it for as at present so it depends on what you using the electric highway as their app paul or as their up and so forth right there were about two or three minutes behind on the messages so again we may have to skip some yeah did you buy full self-driving for tesla no i'm not paying five or six thousand pounds for something that's not ready yet and i'll call in every news - no not at all i said i do use autopilot on a motorway or long duel kaiser is something that but not not in town it just doesn't work very well 8 2008 coming in two weeks yes it was a hardship traveling to france it was awful the storyteller be that to ever again it might that private pool and he was it was too cold he's total and the four-poster bed i don't know tell you any recommendations where to get a good fine i'll steal a tv with the insurance maintenance thrown in to be honest the best thing to do is get a finance from your bank for the car and just shop around for insurance why have maintenance thrown in hmm it's usually no cheaper it just means you've paid it by finance and be paying interest on the maintenance as well so it's cheaper to do all separately they might experience anyway unless you mean a lease deal then just shop around again to be honest right hey where'd you stay for that shirt not the jug thank you very much everyone likes that [ __ ] looking forward to try not the nearest thing norfolk us to an eevee charging hope yeah i thought it a bit the black black all in terms of charges dunning offer 500 uk and ireland test the charging station you stole recently you know i've used it once and that was just our curiosity for 10 minutes cuz i'm really gone i'm not gonna into any yet mg stanley have done updates for the mg zetas cv you just definitely it seemed to be dealer dependent should i wait until next year to buy my new evie might what you're getting if you can afford the one you want now and then my way it's not gonna get any cheaper well these it and i think and then you know what's coming out in the next six months or 12 months so if you're thinking of buying it and evie that's not out yet putting a deposit down and then it you get it first in six months time a 93 something but you know been there maybe what's the plan sauce work for this is it hard work it's a lot more than people think to be perfectly honest with you because if for every hour i film i'll do at least 2 to 3 or editing so it's difficult not so much but you have to do a every week really to keep up with it and it's just time i have a full-time job if i'm late and he's two-timing it's going to the gym he's going to the gym hard well if you're gonna go out timing isn't it gotta make time dribbles really right going through my midlife crisis picking my e to oil last thursday i don't i haven't got my midlife crisis ting it it was me evk who said enjoy your pizza i know alice i know shouldn't you be in bed alice now of course you shouldn't it's a saturday you can stay up until twelve o'clock tonight daddy says it's me sleaze and many sweet sees you want well ebk it would do what you want and ask for the screen time password from mommy what me internet for you right keep scrolling down these messages will probably do the winning announcement in five minutes we've been on for 28 28 minutes 290 people watching currently all waiting for me to find out if they win the thing in there with envy right i'm hoping to buy a model 3 at the end of this year may i ask if you worked up your finance for yours with the tests that yeah just go online on tesla's website and little finance thing where you just move the slider along so i get a salute tesla because he's much easier and the interest rate wasn't really any worse than the bank and pcbs a lot easier i find through through the dealer will you or have you done a on public charging network i already have it's in the but it is about a year or so all french fries it's not french writer you know crinkle crinkle cooked chips it's difficult eating and talking at the same time i mean don't get cold peter here write a few more questions oh god so many we are did you book shelley with me charge going on outside plug no because we've got a car with a range of two hundred and sixty seventy miles yeah and loads are up with charges and if you have to you can just use a three people socket mmm the cars parked overnight right i have a fur killer our leaf on eighty eight percent of state of health trying to get the state of health to 75 percent to trigger the warranty [music] thing is thus yeah i don't a 2,000 miles long way yeah about probably take a lot longer than you think hmm hey that's about right to be honest i mean the only thing you could do without his levy fully discharged or fully charged for a length of time basically you want it to damage it what happened and the only other to get it back to 75% minimum health about the warranty not give you new battery although i believe everyone so far has cousin just got a new battery so it june i will return you open your petrol heads car me in a leaf put some exhaust leak i bet you old you get more people look around your car than the chap with the box on over no i've been way oh it's electric one everyone should smash the button for the youtube algorithm go on then do i do i get in

it the sonic rings sonic rings are geeked about their yeah is that ami drops mmm can you teach eevee nick how to edit youtube videos i've not seen a lot of his recently to be able to perfectly honest for your book it's a lot harder than you think to edit a especially when you don't know how adding videos hmm but it's learn as you go along but yeah i think sometimes people need to just shorten the videos by its take another procedure take anybody to add or yeah you have to be ruthless i find it's doing it we all have moffat clearance 20 minutes watching now any suggestions on decent bike rack

high-end jugular with the meridian sound system the good festival speed he's amazing i mean it's all sarena by the carrying itself did you get some tesla shots i didn't - no i'm afraid about me it's all possible bet chivas regal nice whiskey mommy what do you think of the x pen that the cheap on the wrongfully charged that isn't that price in any way shape or form listen in a which i don't often disagree with fully charged but the did a send this is an i've been nine thousand nine thousand dollar electric vehicle from china clearly would never be sold in this country for the fact it was probably you know yacht more protection in a crispity yeah basically but even if it was that was after government grants in china one of the country sells that car costa rica $22,000 mmm that's the real price of it and so so yeah any other questions guy got another kind of caught up an hour-ish there's no real plan on this one ask anything at all about anything this guy a bottle it will run fourteen year old whisky i use you i ran your doober on whiskey i will be buying the only charger because of your review will you have a discount anytime soon you know what ask smart home charger on twitter in fact they got the wrong youtube just search for it and ask them honda eat opinions you know what i will be able to tell you in a few weeks because i am gonna be getting in one week maybe i saw a by a chap on a legend motorcycle yesterday can you drive more cycle if you i've never ridden a motorbike in my life give it a go i got really good yeah i was offered one well by artists on i think it is he'll do with a small electric stuff well i'd have to buy a helmet and just just a test any license oh i think i could get one see joking about but about to get the gear just to test it and it's not worth you know even with eyes right steve messages again are the ccs charges working for you okay so far so far we are not a failure and one of them was electric highway what of the city covariance mini i3 and hungary got in common no ccs standard i don't know somebody i free you tell me yeah tell me what do you think of the zappy versus the army the zappy is good because it does something relatively unique with this solar diverse you solely mmm but it's a lot more expensive and for me diverting solar to your car it's quite cool you know saying i drive on a pure electric pure sunshine robert it's quite cool to see it but when you pay so little on something octopus agile for your electricity and then when you consider how often you're gonna get enough excess solar in this country the amount of money you're saving is it's 20 quid a year at best so paying to three hundred quid more for something to save 15 20 quid a year is it really worth it that's my only issue unless you've got a huge array on your roof of course stay down for five more minutes then ebw sending me to bed now said you could stay up till midnight you know you did yep if you go back in - absolutely so yeah mommy's wrong i'm still gonna pay for this money go well it's the best place to buy a 3-pin charger or me dad - cheapest sleeping charger the renault zoe for a three-peat - you don't get it with the car so if you want in - three pin charger to plug into a renault zoe and this was on the force or i assume it's the same price how much do you reckon for a three-pin plug to plug in to your car i mean they have to be very sick thrill jennings pounds the or me one flew octopus was being sold for 250 and that links in with your tower yeah yeah it does the same job yeah so oh we call me charger yeah and yeah you can buy it or you couldn't buy it from octopus for cheaper than direct as well so if your customer if you already have solar it works out great even with the [ __ ] hoth system i can keep my eye three charged up how many miles you do though yeah and if you're only paying that's one that's what i mean so if your work he cost me about 135 pounds for 10,000 miles so even if i got free electricity yeah isn't saving 135 pounds over 10,000 miles by getting free yeah so i guess it makes sense eventually but i think the idea of charging off your roof is better than financials behind it oh well don't know how much extra is omi's planning pv diversion i've talked to them and i've have said it's plumbed but they've gone in these extra hardware yeah that's ultimately why it's not firmware update zap he's planning on doing the scheduled timing timing thing so that would make them catch up but again it's two or three hundred quid dearest so whatever you can afford really right did you see and yn there could couldn't believe we get electricity for free was ny in the newspaper oh welcome back to uh uh av do we who needs a bottle of wine to finish off she doesn't drink wine he barely drinks stops infers anything it's hard a woman um no no it'll be what's long as feist walking she's far too healthy and musically and things that fun for me but yeah she's fine she's just to be fair she didn't get home from work did my beautiful wife until half 6:00 this morning and then did go bed until 8:00 you better let it work mmm she works for the emergency services and so she's probably quite tired mm-hmm yeah right let's get down we'll only be giving away any more charges who knows ask or me if this is successful enough maybe we still don't about chris the winner post will be a bueno i'm gonna have to put the crystal gate if you don't get in touch within a week i'll just have to read you i guess but i'm pretty sure he loved it rami right on now you know my youtube i haven't seen him so i can't can't say right four seats that's where the city go mini i three and honda everyone coming ah technically the mini has got five seats no trivia for you there guys quick question does it only happen in north american products not what you know of no i'm afraid not well if you could get an adapter yeah yeah you both laughing laughs white piece of wood thank you so i see so we were actually chatting about being simpler than the wheel yeah worth the read re-watch i think yeah thanks to evw for all the hard work for the emergency services mmm absolutely mmm i'm to everyone else yes have a beer anybody have any drink right now which is saturday night yes yeah under not so much lockdown anymore no hmm don't any other questions before we disappear i guess guys no of course simon's i'm gonna drink yeah well yes i got a doubt that's dinnertime puckster evw putting up with evn he's having whiskey which i mean stout good tea oh old rosy cider mm-hmm did you find commendation easy to find we've been appeared so many times we know where to stay it was a bit more tricky this time yeah yeah self carrying but that's it's just time and googling we actually found some better place through this this is perfect sartet drinking corona and making a pollock nose : sir whiskey kasich aroma wine rather have beer yes yes definitely i think as the aukerman we would probably get beat up if we drunk wine well won't be allowed back on we'd know check on the border one third flies undred once between still light outside well yeah i mean sometimes you know it's copy hmm fun too i'm gonna be a while celebrating my mum city r15 no of you in fact i don't check the football scars you have to do what the football scores guys just briefly if you could let me know i got my old seat box hey i got my first car this year in your commute speeds go to electric for your first ever cat fight kilowatt leaf back in february no after that's my driving test you got the cat you got for killing our leaf for your first car mine was a woman leader 15 year old metro with four gears and 59 breakers but it could do awesome handbrake turns and then i added for a whole three and a half months before some squirrel to huddersfield uni stole it and then drove it around the ruby pitching huddersfield and reversed into a tree to get the ridiculously overpriced speak as i put in the parcel shelf of the car that was worth three hundred pounds the speaker's worth more than the car yeah the world night-night ally cb kid going to bed it seems and even though i said she could stay with me bail plenty of garlic on the bolognese to counteract the corona yes you can try bleach we're not advising that you do tinned tomatoes or passata oh that's expensive my two things you have to open up is if you pass your test in a tv can you drive in money or are nice car no because they're effectively automatic first gal morris marina it was crap but it was your first and about you still think about it does you got the seaside in it 1.6 mac one cavalier for my first car yeah what was your first car guys that's quite an interesting what would you mind was a polar 1.4 cl a 1.4 yeah was that the one that you got with the induction kick to make it faster and the back seats now just make it faster yeah which is basically a speaker can you seed a mini 850 first car mg's eddy mini cooper convertible it was 1.1 ford fiesta i had one of those a reg mack free escott 1.6 cassidy's tilly aviva gt world's it wow 3s got 1.3 l 1.5 1.1 fiesta l i had my second cow was a 1.1 fiesta at lx oh yeah but that was my bike over my first proper cap red not my good that we still going yeah whooping oh yeah now you're not leaving pizzas some way those your partner van nissan chariot father scarf and cherry mike wouldn't paul or old be rich they were cracking up father scott van vauxhall astra 1.4 merit wow that's probably the worst i mean no no first car is bad is it no but an aster i guess it turns on it's the age but a married was no public space was it but again he's first cat who cares but i've never been a big fan of foxholes if i'm honest minium extra yeah mine was a mine was the it was still the mini metro but is almost the rover badge on it yeah it was went robber had buy button before the greek chain changed it all over and he came with optional rust in fact i think i have to tell everyone what edition my mini and not my meaning my metro was he was a city xx did the x genuinely now the x give you different ally different wheel caps not only wheels cuz they did a city this was the city x and with the x you got the different wheel caps and a digital clock in the dashboard in the dashboard and it literally was that big in a big plastic thing that he was casio watch no no i'm not lying it was a casio watch do you know the little where you put coin slot yeah cuz on that side you had a coin slot and on this side you just took the coins flour and put a casio watch in his place that's what the city x gave you that's where that's what that that's where his special edition was a special edition yeah first car harold ford cortina brown begat the wife had you know turbos the first oh wow that's that did you out sick the few who know was one of the transformed the market was the first to do what was it something to do with a have not a hatchback but a supermini at all back for did something for the first time really yeah useless trivia there that cabin under hang called bubble car that is awesome hyundai i20 1949 for tata beale wow nice loop pull the loop i do the name is a lupo gti and it does look very nice just basic form power in it betty didn't want to hang around mcdonald's car parks or castle without very good point we know someone with a saucer do it we do yeah would hang around would i'm at in tomato i'm passat or as well hmm ah in sheffield do you put black gold on it oh and if you don't know what i mean you're not from sheffield henderson's rubbish for those outside of sheffield 95 vauxhall cavalier rover tim for that mother brother one of those is that the case you had the square e shape or the mmm the coupe is quite nets can mean you make sure yeah men chose for awesome roast came standard fit on metro he did yep how to get my option he did you know yeah fair joe even millions suzuki splash well we behind you grounded suzuki splash i mean care i have never really heard of before we need this are you going to call the towers next year if it song yes obviously won't be this year all my cars turned out to be classics wish i had kept them all now worth a fortune roasting spectacles yeah yeah i doubt that stearman we rolled down the hill saw a cop car and crapped ourselves and parked it at the field at the bottom of the hill i almost missed the first post on come on give us a birthday song i cannot sing and i'll never do that to the anything else to ask before we despair guys even though still 200 people watching this crap fiat 600 d what's that i'm guessing it's a 600 and you enough to google that one first guy was a brand new citroen c4 grand picasso i've been riding motorcycle for seven years byron scott oh cool i do the 600 d it's very nice certainly not diesel first car was asked order felicio all right yep or felicia sorry not the score to felicia no object grunge i'm guessing you're in america he said tom's birthday are evms it's a chance five years ago today at the first evv i went about five today yeah i'm not five i wish by chaps yes i will be going to did you tell the accommodation on you were going to charge overnight we're not not to be honest i mean happy life yeah yeah i don't think they've got a problem i mean we could do i guess but to be honest it's so many roughly charges right it's not really a problem and every charge eagle - there's a beautiful walk to go off on so you're not just sat in uk right no so it is apollo's well it's been your best car ever for me personally corrado vr6 maybe not the most reliable but is it civilian when i think back and wish i still had focus st focus st mark a steamer hybrid why don't you vauxhall's because they all have five million buttons in them there though i think it's just a boring yeah what was the last vauxhall that came out where most people you know the motoring press and people in general win it's not a clean car recently i mean that they do a good job though it's a bit high volume caboose and now i've cost alone by perl publicly ps airline sir persia i think one the most reliable car hmm oh brunt recently so that they really do developers or minivan with holes in the floor ventilation my dad filled them with cement that that's how you fix us today yeah [ __ ] the day [ __ ] their bits event in their first car on vodka bri people are getting far too a good first ghazi acid beating it we meet up here wow 1.3 midnight blue allegro first the austin allegro that's heard out of garbage you know the the bum garbage is she good-looking yeah do you think tester should open the superchargers for all the vehicles no because they didn't pay for it that's why i saying should i open my personal charger at home to other vehicles it's a private system what's your beef with voxels i just i mean to be fair my my wife had a vauxhall corsa from new a one liter 12 valve octave which has and yeah in six and a half seven years we owned it it never went wrong the only thing that we had to spend on it were maintenance items but i hated it i mean the interior was of the bottoms yeah i've been 34 buttons on the dash and he was i think they're just borrowing i don't know why look at the fiesta st yeah one of the best cars of the modern age what was the last good vauxhall but you know people look back on for me it was the gte the astra gt i grew up with nova's who'd driven to 20 well that's not there's not a box of the lotus in there and be exact no because it was awful it was all for powered beyond belief on it and it couldn't steer all they did is make something with more power than anything else i thought of what that chunk but it didn't did it the mondeo st was a better car and a quick all around the truck yeah i believe nova sr i think i've got too many getting over sticker red topping it there you go hundred and fifty brake yeah i mean it's gonna be a pocket rocket you think of an offer don't you and think of massive exhausts never time the wire yeah that's a mini fastest last time they made a decent car yeah and don't forget nova in most of europe means no girl does it that's why they called it the cos are in on the continent your bet trivia for you there guys ooh the exam fn2 civic type-r on my third i just that the effing the bread van are the knife and two zeeman extra mom from that the one that clarkson didn't a nice car yeah the vauxhall meriva remember that when you up oh god yeah as a courtesy cat the offense oh yeah no the f into is a really good bite it really is it's very cheap as well cheaper than i oh yeah now what's the special one the special moogan moogan moogan either due to news only break mugen don't get a-movin expensive where are you tonight girl look nowhere near lock karen sorry karen right austin allegro i grew up yeah first guy mark too far let's go i grew up on father's cause my dad got a new entrants cookies guyot you know yeah personal 404 pickle wow best car i ever owned and i've had 911s was the vauxhall vxr8 herb oh i've been in one surpassing journey was yeah i would say this i yeah mommy it's a lot of thought that's i do a class that in the foxhole okay to twitter yeah we agree the x 220 a fantastic app yeah fantastic a she's not vox on that's why we're not including talvez on me a manaro it's not it's not vox yes holden so basically they're buying cars cuz they can't make their own decent one yeah basically in it gsi mm that's the aster isn't it yeah yeah i think the gte for me we were just well it would kill you by the count i was at bots scotland again but even then even if we agreed the lord yeah yeah even if a be the lot skelton was awesome in it how long ago was that to say that was the last good vauxhall yeah this is what me think about it what was the last good box all that you think good car okay all good looking i mean what was got the mom a mocker a mocker and i think for me this is that this typifies vauxhall you look at the back of the majority of vauxhall's on the road right now new ones past five years and have them say turbo on the back oh yeah as if that's a turbo oh yeah because everyone look at that and go wow it's got turbo on it because nor the cow doesn't fighter boy yet even on the band's um so yeah that that says that's the best thing that can put in the back a turbo because every car in the world how's the lust astra vxr is the best hot hatch apart from the civic type-r oh yeah and meeny-meeny-meeny cooper works think he's personal tastes is personalization yeah it might be but fast for fast vauxhall i mean i grew up yeah yeah the box all abdomen i mean the other special edition called the atom slam sounds a foam star film star yet i have an atom slam brilliant i'm sorry it's just awful i'm seriously the possibility of kiki fracturing wheels never gonna happen mac too cavalier and astro were good i never said they weren't good but that's a long time yeah that's a long time ago and the astor's of that age were very good what was the last proper vauxhall that was aspirational someone when i want one of them well and i'm not talking about vauxhall fonzie well you have the motoring press where everyone basically goes you know what by the fiesta st here everyone agrees people stalling the motoring press well the best hot hatches exactly when was the last votes all that people actually respected yeah that was a vauxhall what what do you call a vauxhall because holden auckland vauxhall have been one run for a long time but the holden was it was a cow that holden made did they rebadged it wasn't a shared chassis was it he wasn't a combine design there literally went that's that's nice let's rebadge it for us and bring it over from australia so it wasn't a core developed thing so i would say a car that was at least developed by vauxhall yummy personally right right of it have to skip a few comments here unfortunately again guys we haven't been over the hill yet no f'n the tie come as a turbo even the tie come i think not going on too many drinks yes - honey the tie pass couldn't keep up with the thule astra ice all right turbo in the devon b roads well not driving actually aspirated versus a turbo about the civic was mouthful i mean depends who's driving it confusing fast we felt good and respect yeah yeah you know genuinely now what was the last vauxhall but everyone thinks that that was a good lot of that's probably that's true as well with us hmm he was a quick car that i believe i mean when i'm thinking of it is it wasn't yeah a quick cowl in it yeah which is why nobody's buying them do you know anybody would do know how do many people do you know with this the focus st ora i mean the focus rs worldwide everyone's going this is amazing yeah i cut my voice box or leaves about kleber there every time about it don't see on the road but cleveland over vauxhall oh god i would never aspire to a vauxhall but if i was a rep insignia gsi yeah so the fit purpose but nobody aspires to be a rep i guess yeah might be the e corsa which is to be honest i'd go for the eat or eight because it's basically the same town that's a better-looking one i'm gonna believe consistent cheaper cheaper vauxhall opal holden what student what i've just done said i guess we're just missing look council he's the only one i think of and when did that come out look at me they handball to scour me right we'll go through these questions and then we'll come up i think so any more questions get me now because they're about to come out will kiss man you know i brought this a few times it will kids still be able to modify v's who knows cosmetically of course the will you must be able on reduces message a college in tesla cat exactly we're up in kenya if he's if he's light system i think yeah i think it's gonna be it's gonna be cosmetics yeah yeah but as far as the remapping goes and whatnot i don't know i mean it's not as if you can stick a big sports exhaust how can the ecu to providing more power to the scaffolding pipe they do on an arm i think so yeah again a flame kit for it what's the noise that the locals charles smokies yeah what noise are the new trying accentuate on an electric vehicle supercharger while you may be struck some duracell to my eevee might to make it faster in it hmm well that's a question what's the worst vauxhall meriva yeah i had one of those and it was awful and he went through a few business you actually took it back because it was cursed accursed cat i bought a brand new car and it didn't work from day one and very helpfully they gave me a box even though he did buy a box off no i'm not a bus girl and yeah it was so awful i took you back and they gave me over it's gone off the file car it was crying it would cost you a fortune yeah custody marvin the spot your caliber the jackie were right pierce i believe internally at least as a noise which changes speed that gives in accentuate yeah so you know we do going faster cuz he tried to give it some so feedback we need that door you don't have any sense of hmm oh less sense of speed you do do it yeah you do look down he go home spending i'm speeding on the track oh yeah my first car was a vauxhall victor 101 oh my dad had a big accident in a vauxhall carlton which ironically was a courtesy car because the escalade had was in the shop for an accident as of june is drink-driving episodes as soon as they eat it got hit by a polish lorry driver this is in the 80s going wrong way around the roundabout and it knocked him down in banking roll down well the police managed to dry it you got to get it back on the road and every panel was that and he still drawable well in the said if you'd have been in the air sky so that need to be dead it was a tank yeah and then cuz it was a courtesy car he drove it back to the dealership i thought yeah cuz his car was in for repair some went into the bathroom and not kidding in three years it was in i think nine times for accidents that someone has drove into my dad he didn't what he did about fifty thousand miles a year to the point and where we genuinely got a christmas card from the ford dealership so yeah it's yeah that the cow i suppose cast back then work tanks were them especially the big ones so right i think we're done i think with all we've got some fun games drinking and fun to go on so everyone could yeah yeah this is a one-off for what we're doing live streams very often accented clearly didn't work over the knockdown period is difficult it so if that chris ed decent alright you're saying soon you won the ami chachi if you're watching do can we use down really absolutely this crystal surely if you don't know what this is crystal head vodka google it and he say anyone only to drink some vodka now yes sir i forgot what i'm gonna say now okay if you're watching would you clearly not know but if you're watching it afterwards if you do watch it you'll still be on the email because if you don't email within the next seven days i'm gonna have to give it to someone else can you post it on your youtube the winner yeah try and get older this guy come on toast i guess chin chin did you guys get back in the zone this is what he guesses innuendos just exist it all the time for us i have to hold his tongue when he's online as a question to finish on then something i've been toying with is it worth doing a second youtube purely for live streams cuz i do enjoy doing them there is it you can do it whenever you it off to schedule them and if he people obviously got fed up with a lot of live streams going on on the main so that's not gonna work it's not gonna happen so is it worth setting up a second tunnel just purely for that and you can if you want to yeah yeah so but you know just just to fly this or if i've got care delivery doing little things i can just almost the vlog again yeah yeah so let me know i guess because that i think yet the analyzer sometimes interacting with people he was i think a second as well cause he wouldn't messi up you know each other with all these i think people getting fed up with all the notifications yeah you know when there were two or three a week with too many colonies and obviously really people tend not to watch these when they've no longer yeah well they not dilute the first no no no it what changed the first the additional two because i tried it over the lockdown doing additional videos that were live and my subscribers literally the number away from yeah basically it just remains static yeah people you know literally the lockdown has been terrible for me but it's just remain static ever since then i've gone back to just doing one every friday and he's come back to normal clearly people don't more videos i'm able to meet once a week so no fear maybe people limit yeah but there were no more vvm in the life we've chosen them and so i just think that because if someone likes to little if the dog or whatever know it exists yeah and you could do a little other things this this is just on the second yeah if we do another giveaway just on the second i don't know this is why it's a triumph well once you're my mark network and so right i think we're done i'm gonna finish my pizza off this now stone cold mm-hmm yeah so keep an eye on the twitter feed want to post about the scotland trip which is the brilliance anyway and if you're not bring up here before definitely fun it if you can't you know if you can't get away this summer on a holiday abroad definitely think about scotland yeah it's amazing oh york unless you from lancashire yeah i'm not interested in fact what do we do if chris edison who won the army charges from lancashire who is it terms of good if you're from lancashire you're not yeah right and i'll see you well there will be a up on next friday and that will kind of what would be about sir okay i know week after lap okay yeah in fact not i know it is about what i tell you right and so okay thanks for watching guys enjoy where's the roast project i'm gonna see if i could remember i'll turn this thing off i think you press that and then go up there right bye",0
Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK3WKwmReTmSFjf3mjWm4MJZ,xVIF1mqcnlY,"hi guys and welcome to another live stream i'm here with chris from the kamini youtube who would live sundays from germany he's done a recent about the nissan leaf and rapid gait which is what this live stream is all about and which is why i am talking to chris of course so thanks for doing this chris all the way from germany and you wouldn't know from your accent because you speak better english than me good good well then the way i found your was through various other videos but the one that caught my eye was obviously the one that he did just before you bought the the new fort kilowatt leaf and that was the one about the rapa gate you basically it looked a demo that you got from a dealer and then you did a bit of a test on the auto bouncer could you give us a can i a brief synopsis of what you did and what ultimately happened in the yes of course so i did three videos one main review about the disbelief where it's all about performance the advantages of the options and everything and another one was charging so that people who tried to get in touch with the mobility can have a gain some knowledge about charging how to charge would you come with kind of options we have and in the third is a rapid gait which is surprise surprise the most successful one because the biggest biggest thing now about the nissan leaf and well this test is a bit off-topic for people living in the uk or living in any country except germany because i was trying to simulate a realistic circumstances in germany because it's a problem is if you drive evey car speeds on the german autobahn 110 kilometers per hour but let me say 70 miles the problem is that everyone is faster than you are because the average is driving hundreds 60 km as power and you feel really slow and i was trying to simulate a situation when trading your combustion engine for an e car and you're trying to flow with the traffic and for this you need to drive hundred forty kilometers per hour and i wanted to see how the cars behavior is in this case i drove from munich where i live 40 kilometers to playtest being 200 meters higher than munich is so we went uphill a bit but driving hundred 40 km/h really yeah punched up the temperature the battery temperature from 26 degrees or i started with up to 51 degrees and of course the bats really hot stuff and i just turned around after 40 kilometers drove back so downhill and went to the rapid charger and this rapid charger from my experience gives 45 kilowatts if a car has no issues with a battery temperature and yeah suddenly i recognized that the metro temperature is a big problem because i start to charge you with 90 t kilowatts instead of 45 and through the whole times charging with 19 luckily i haven't got throttle down to 40 awesome from equal nightmare but anyway it's a nightmare because it's a half of charging speed so means double time of charging and that's a tragedy only if you drive back fast yes so so basically you drove that fast you couldn't even do a single rapid charge i've been to normal speed because the batteries were too too hot so my experience says now and many other experience has proven that if you sir what cows is the temperature of the batteries when you start the charging so if you starts at i did a few days years ago at a rapid charger with my leaf i started charging at 29 degrees and while charging the battery temperature went off to 49 degrees so 20 degrees more but still it went with 45 kilowatts it's somebody kept this level because what counts to the battery management system of anna solley is the temperature when starting to charge me it doesn't matter to the battery temperatures battery management system how the battery temperature goes higher it's the thing once and starting at the starting point that's what counts and that's why when you charge once and you battery temperatures combined you never got to get throttled down so you can try this 45 easily but the next one's going to be the problem because of charging rapid charging is punching up temperature and at the next rapid charge adds about 200 200 just 220 kilometers the battery temperature is still so fine that nothing is fair due to missing thermal management what could balance or pull down the battery temperature so you are charging the second time with that 42 degrees of battery temperature and that's why you're never going to charge the second time faster or more than let me say third c 27 or somewhere that kilowatts and that's also there's already a lot slower than normally all your first yeah yeah so presumably then if certainly in so many in germany you're gonna have to stick to slower speeds if you want to do a longer journey i mean does that be does that turn you into a little bit of a liability or is it is it not uncommon you know when you're going slow on a bomb if you're in your leaf and you need to charge so therefore you have to speak to say 110 kilometres an hour about 70 yeah i would suffer from that but i'm a german and as i explained at the beginning the problem is that everyone is passing by a lot faster than you are so hundred kilometers per hour especially for a speed enthusiast me it's not really a good deal but in the end you have to see that if you can just follow us yourself to drive hundred ten you gotta get faster to your target than driving faster because driving faster is only good for this short period of time until you reached a charter and as soon as he have done so the charging time will cost you so much time so the charging will cost you so much time that it would have been better driving under ten keeping the battery temperature constant at about thirty degrees where you have no issues or either charging thirty forty five minutes and driving off again and having charged with the full amount of power that the rapid charger can give you so driving slower is faster in the end so it's they taught us in the hair basically yeah is that actually myself in both the leafs i vowed if you drive more economically you'll get there obviously a bit slower but ultimately you have to charge less because you've used less power so it kind of balances out a bit but the fact that you can get that the can get about temperatures we've not too much effort does beg the question of all the countries around the world i mean i had a look at a look online and next week for example in arizona it's due to get above 40 degrees centigrade and they sell the leaf in in that parcel you know we're not talking saudi arabia now we're talking america and occasionally parts of europe get above 40 i know it's rare but you know spain for example so presumably it could be in a situation in a hot country where you simply just cannot wrap each charge your car before you've even driven it because the ambient temperatures too hot yeah so i think we have to we have to pay attention on not being so much against this only i'm not saying that this has a nissan leaf owner because i can i can definitely criticize everything about my car if there is something to criticize but we also have to see realistic circumstances because the problem is that many many people are uploading videos combustion engine drivers or press people driving nissan leaf once not having really read so much about it it's driving it for one or two hours and the only thing that they see is well i'm so even press from america or canada where they see ok we have 40 degrees and already the first rapid charging stucked actually but then the car the press cars were standing in the bride's and punching sunlight for hours and hours and if you own any car i think 90% of the e car owners have a garage especially in america and if you have 40 degrees outside if gary is not going to be hotter than 25 never side and your battery is gonna have 23 degrees and if you drive and you start driving it needs plenty of time for your battery cells getting up to the level it will but the battery cells will but it takes some time reaching the level of the deteriorate so it's not you pan am gonna be starting with a hot bat agree because no one is spamming permanently for hours and hours outside except the people driving to work don't have a garage and they just have their car standing man of course that's the disadvantage but not starting in the morning and this is what press people do never tell you because they only don't know it because they don't be got this fact that it's not realistic cuz they uni car driver always have a kazakh garage and when starting i think you need to drive about yeah what could be realistic about an hour until the 24 at 25 degrees celsius factory temperature goes up to the current exterior temperature of 40 degrees and then it could be also 40 degrees is not 50 degrees so you can still charge with that 32 kilowatts if you need so but anyway the other realistic question that we have to ask ourselves with anna solley is who drives more than the current range of the masala 40 kilowatt however battery gives you so you can drive well in the day of the car does about 130 miles but do i know freak was that that's just on a normal kind of dick so i take the car to work i come home then my wife takes it to work as well so we both use it for commuting and because we work at different times but we my parents live down south of england so that's probably about 300 miles each way and that's a semi-regular journey there and obviously because i've got the i do longer journeys than a traditional evo and it probably would for videos or just to see people so i've done about 27,000 miles in about 18 months on the 30th of course not the 40 but the mcmahon i suppose my issue is that the previous leafs didn't have this problem because obviously the battery was smaller and it was less apparent should we say was the thermal issue so i also feel that misun i've taken a step backwards on an issue which everybody i mean i've i've kind of mentioned this a few times from previous videos but the ionic the a3 the renault zoe even the renault twizy are some form of battery cooling but the new state-of-the-art nissan leaf doesn't even though everyone was kind of screaming for it on the 30 and just it's just a it's a backwards step which most people as you said warn or will notice sorry you know the the usage pattern will highlight this issue certainly in the uk anyway but it's something that i think it said it's a it's a problem that shouldn't have been there in the first place because miss and should have obviously knew it was coming so i really appreciate having a thermal management because i wouldn't need to watch permanently of the miss elise by at what i do especially today i did so because i knew we gotta have this life intention and i was i wanted to see how how the battery temperature develops was drawing around 60 kilometres highway city and stuff and but i say so my opinion is but with a 40 kilowatt hour leaf if you drive 400 kilometres one so altogether one day i think you're not going to suffer from the rabbids gate issue because the furnace charge in the uk you're not going to have thermal problems because let's be honest how fast can you drive without risking punishments in the uk so i thank you what's what's what's your highway driving speed what's this the speed lemis 70 on all motorways miles per hour or 70 miles per hour is the border where the battery temperature doesn't start going up and up and up where it stays slightly below or constant with the exterior temperature this is what i did today we had 25 degrees today here in munich and i drove archaeologist power for about 15 20 kilometers so constantly and battery temperature was twenty seven point two degrees the maximum and this is the border so if you don't cross the 70 miles per hour border you're not gonna have problems issues with rapid gait so and if you stop once in your driving behavior you can charge within 45 minutes really up to 80 percent and drive off again so hundred fifty 130 miles you said would be 200 meters or 300 miles that that'd be a that beard to visit my parents at one continuous strip so that that be along the creek yeah that's the biggest one [applause] i think this is possible in the uk so if you if you lived in just let me say how his owner i'd say from off the line don't buy this car anyway it doesn't matter how much you drive both because one thing is and this is i think the next point where we can get to one thing is the the speed while charging due to overheating battery cells the other thing is that even if you let me say that someone let us say that someone doesn't charge at the rapid charger but he dries faster speeds and hop higher temperatures in arizona and he knows ok this highway is free of just get by i could drive faster and he dies permanently every day with battery cell temperatures about 4045 degrees one thing is the charging speed where he maybe doesn't care about because he charges overnight in his garage because it goes by 100 miles now even if you try as fast as range start get that low that if you can't get code back so he charges in this garage no problem with rapid charging but the battery cell temperature and that's the second fear of many people could cause a problem movie the life cycle so the longevity on battery cells your life cycle so that maybe after three years of having started with 100 percent of battery state as state of health starting with one percent where you get the car as a new car and after three years making any 75 that to me also a tragedy because 75 percent means you have basically a third less battery capacity after three years it may be you must slightly above the warranty auditor so mister doctor give you new battery because if you haven't cost before but still it's 25 percent less battery capacity and this is once the overheated battery cells constantly repeated battery to tell scoot cause we don't know it and i think you have to wait about the year or one and a half until these long distance long distance baby drivers upload the missile base by hadn't screenshots waiting to see the state of health there you can see that maybe it's also possible that these new battery cells that belief has are more heat resistant so maybe it doesn't matter at all that much drive maybe 40 45 degrees we don't know it but this is stronger now right now as we don't know it current owners really have to watch out for the battery temperature if it's constantly above 40 degrees that's why i say if you live in arizona may have weeks of 40 45 degree celsius it's a bad idea yeah is that good pleasing car if you get it back after three years where it's this but if you buy it most of people do yeah i mean do you believe that even though most people will see this issue as you've said the nissan have kind of an obligation to make it clear in their marketing their brochures the website or whatever doesn't have to be a big sign but there's nothing even in the terms and conditions to say this isn't a long-range vehicle be aware or you know i've literally wrong four different dealerships up yesterday electric special you know special dealerships and that specialize in the leaf sales and spoke to the leaf specialist and i don't know whether they've been told to just don't admit anything but that they didn't either know existed i didn't want to mention it existed so i think nissan should be basically doing what half of the the eevee community and social media is doing for them and letting people know that look okay it might be a good care yes equal suit most people but you need to be aware of these limitations so i don't want someone to get one and then maybe the usage pattern changes or something and being in that situation that you think's i think they have an obligation to to come clean if you on this because with with the predecessor disability it was or it is the best-selling ad car in the world and of course the expectation of of facing this status record again is higher than let me state so if they sell 200,000 units of a new nissan leaf these 7,000 people complaining about it on the internet they can live with it yeah cuz there is to trust i didn't know it because even my car dealer here in munich didn't say anything about it so i was confronting him with that i was not confronting my tell i told him i did a rapid gait test with his car and actually some temperature went up to 50 degrees he didn't say anything but maybe this is because he sells 5eb cars per year and versus combustion engines so he doesn't care or any he doesn't know this is thing that you can't find out does the dealer who you ask doesn't respond to this question doesn't he know it but doesn't want to tell anything about it because maybe it's more important to get the client's sell the car and afterwards the clients can't do anything at all because he already bought a car and he's sitting on it and who is just who has that that media platform behind behind himself you me of saying okay if you don't tricked me i'm gonna do a and i'm gonna punch your face 99.5% of the owners don't so what are they doing they are completely mad - in front of the friends and for the big one but that doesn't influence sales because it's just i said 7,000 people being pissed and the other 193,000 people i'm not complaining about it or i'm not touched by the issue because so they have to say no now because it's many many negative things ever since these 20 minutes that we've been talking now maybe this tell me so i also have to protect this car because i'm driving it as my daily driver i traded a 385 fps 6-cylinder bmw m4 innocently i'm really happy with it i'm not missing a combustion engine at all to my needs it's perfect because rarely charging once or twice a year i'm mostly driving city traffic and yesterday it showed me after having charged it 318 kilometres of great this is 168 miles enough range and i'm not driving in eco mode i'm permanently drunk me with that vehicle oh because i the acceleration of the normal mode and these leads this car is perfect lot better than the you may are unique because it has a lot of interior the car looks better in my eyes but that's a question of taste it has a better features and except seeds cooling but this is the only thing that it doesn't have and it's all family suitable so you have for in 35 litres of boot space i'm trapped i'm just riding around [music] what workplace chat will come on to the lack of eevee charging in various countries later on because i do want to compare that with in the uk and germany has have an idea of who might be better at doing here well you don't realize i'll say i'll come back to that in a second all right a last question on the leaf in there someone's done a quite a significant study on the 2430 killer our leaf and the drop off if you on the battery health is slightly more on the 30th an the 24 which i guess is kind of to be expected so we can only assume the 40 obviously will be even steeper drop being partly because of this thermal issue sir would you have any concerns if you or remember your family or a friend was buying a four or five year old 40 kilowatt hour leaf you know and if several years time would you know would do you have any issues because obviously the warranty is far less you know it just sticks in your mind that i have no problem with the 24 used i know a lot of people have bought one same with a 30 again it's not big enough to have caused that issue but the forties i'd be a bit nervous i think if someone bought one you know several years down the line so i'm thinking is it is it going to become the one to avoid in the leaf range once we have the 60 and whatever else might come out in the future so i needed a car that's why i got myself this because normally our battery not just because it especially now this shitstorm and 2220 horsepower hmm so let's not talk about this but if you're patient wait for it if you need an ep car now and friend of mine or a family member ask me which to take the thing is that i am so i it depends on his driving behavior and his circumstances because most people i know are not driving more than so the average thing in europe especially germany is 30 miles maybe the maximum altogether so not one way so they're driving to our get back and if you have this and as we don't have permanently 35 degrees celsius on the time made two weeks a year i would recommend to buy the li 40 kilowatt hour just because there are things that where when i sell meant many steps forward just the interior so the build quality is a bit better so it's it's really good standard and the interior design is now less this punch in your face hey see this is an indy car if you haven't recognized it from the exterior looks just take a look in the inside with all these digital things and and and strangely positioned and stuff for my taste even the predecessor was beautiful car but many people say it's ugly and with the current nissan leaf i think 95% of the notice from the breeze society finally now this is a really beautiful car and it is because even the looks is if you have the energy light it's really cool so you can easily stand next to a bmw and it doesn't look cheap i don't know if ct team for the front of back seats yes it was but these kinds of things these assist systems i would recommend to say 40 go out because it's a bit bigger the boot space is bigger so it's more practical in all day use to say well you have eight years of 800,000 miles in the uk even if you get a three versus you can order they gonna change it i'm not all the eevee cars because i think every every new of them has suffered from from from from this i haven't tested on 23,000 miles and it was a 98.7% still according to leaf spy which i know isn't always massively accurate but it is that was kind of averaged out over about a week to try and get a more accurate figure and so i think yeah it's but not yeah it's kind of track of it obviously as he imagined over the past couple of years and it's almost two years old now i haven't tested it for a few months but i have found that or rather i've treated mine completely how nissan saying you shouldn't it's charged to 100% v there's a week at least because we need a hundred percent because we both use it i've done long journeys where the battery temperatures got quite high because obviously you have to do a series of rapid charges i use it as a car i don't want to have to compromise and well my wife doesn't have want to have to compromise dear to this stuff today all don't charge it above eighty percent not interested not interested so for me it's just a cat so i've i always think charging should be in a good diet and keep it varied occasional rapid charge fast charging at home of course and just do different stuff you know door does leave it there the people i thought we did sorry the costume tell us how to treat it we should become tell how it goes so this is maybe it sounds a bit bossy but i think it's just a card just you say and this is why i'm against people i mean we do have to test the lobby with people being saw and convinced there is nothing better than a tester yes there are people still driving from unique survival in i think about four times a week because of business and for these people a tesla even if it's a p hundred d because of the match because they have to try and because they have to charge it with the woman diesel they can try and even if they drive constant 200 kill just for me to pilot they hit on one tank and it could take more than three million to drive because it counts if you are home with your family an hour later oily or earlier and this is what i am just you know this thing that people are saying it's the battery temperature goes higher i'm driving slower but this shouldn't you have to drive you want to drive and if you live in germany and you got used to 20 years driving hundred 70 horsepower at maximum speed hundred forty four a belief and you might define at least 240 kilometers permanently and do it and if you can't because this factory sells overheat you don't have to buy a car you shouldn't suffer from this and say okay i'm just punishing myself by 1810 instead of coming forward to because it's basically 30 miles of distance it's nice i leave tell us how to drive it we should provide we wanted to it's not possible this problem no place it in so it's always here about compromise i find is an electric car ownership at the moment i can take we've got two cars normal karen de vie of course and if we take the normal car it will cost about 70 pounds in petrol if you take the electric car 10 to 15 pounds for the same journey but it will take longer so that it's a compromise need you have time this weekend or do you want to save money once obviously we get a much longer inch that problem goes away but for now there's a compromise [music] especially in city traffic and i said no that stopped me as i was 20 months old sponsor and i'd to do something i to give something back just show you to myself and i'm 32 years old not 21 anymore and do this but still i am really happy about now within this one week that i've been driving around with my leaf i've seen that i have been spending one cent on driving around because i can charge with 1,900 meters away from from my home at the supermarket at a twenty two kilowatt charger and at the radio station where i'm working at we have six kilowatts and it's totally for free so i could use which i take and until now it was totally for free and i'm driving around with not spending even a euro on it and that's the advantage of the high range so yes the communication is a higher range it's just a problem for everyone to do boards for this le falta cannot work out because of the high range of started doing daily longer trips offering now from the replicate but to me it's better but just because you asked me whether to say it's twenty four thirty can work only for this one but if you have the private profile me what i think ninety eighty percent of the people have and of course it's better to have a range of 300 or 350 kilometres having the capability this test where belief yaya me and the leaf 30 human power just went a hundred kilometres and the leaf 30 kilowatt have arrived three hours earlier than new leaf did okay that [ __ ] discussion about this this is just embarrassing and i was it would be shame to media if i was miss on but the other thing is how many times do you do trips these i mean if you buy an easy car i think you have just you have a combustion engine parallels this and i have a combustion engine because if we do longer trips let me say southern a hundred kilometers i know what to lose to two hours of charging even if everything goes well with charging without replicators till two or two and a half hours of bluesy time compared to the combustion engine my distel where i can drive 900 or 1000 kilometers so what'd you buy the the car for and this is what the press people me but i'm communicating it but most of people don't and that's what gives the this ugly bad reputation and that's why people are just you asked me if i recommend to buy an older one just because with charging it's better or the new one but you know there is rumors before we close this chapter there is rumors nissan hasn't included or hasn't put this thermal management e to the miss sunny because they were while actually permanently over the years this term attic system well let me say all these to hundreds of drivers and the average 85 percent of these 200,000 drivers don't do rapidly charging and don't drive more than 100 miles so what's the results we don't need thermal management because 85% of them would be using it so we can keep the costs lower make a car more attractive on the market you're staying a profiler seated eating this heated back full led leather seats pros a sound system and whatever and for the same money you made on any but the problem is what they should watch they did all these development with the largely for the predecessor of course with this car if it weren't driving more than 200 miles because they knew they couldn't yeah but now the people are buying this car because there you can see many common dealers here amelie where where there is 415 kilometers and wlt p range he wanted to if you drive permanently reconfirmation with the panel in the eco mode 30 kilometers power but that's that's not the average so that's allied so that's the only thing they should be communicating the team does should say hey if you buy this car because of the long range air annoying that second charging control down and you do you got a loose time if you don't just me yeah it what would you fear would you pay a few thousand euros or pounds it's a three thousand euros if there was an optional extra for thermal battery management on your leaf yeah if you could pick it as an option would you go for it worth something to you know just because the range of the car is too small because if now the difference between a thermal management range and arrange without a thermal management would be six hundred kilometres compared to or 360 miles compared to the half of it let's say yes of course because then i can get rid of the combustion edge and only drive everywhere even on holidays with the leaf as high as i am just not taking this car for trips longer than 450 kilometers 3000 euros would be a bit too much in my eyes because i'm not suffering from the front from the rapid gait but for people being really interested in in the sun relief and only not buying it because it doesn't have thermal management i think 90% of these people would pay an additional 3,000 euros for having the thermal management yeah thousand euros i would just just just for saying we're not just being the loser in front of patriots a nice but not three three bucks well i picked three thousand just because that's the uk price for the i3 range extender and so just as a figure i mean who knows how much it actually cost me son i'd love to see if if they're just included in every care whether you it make that much difference at all and who knows is something will obviously never know final question then again on the leaf do you think it was an engineering decision to not put this in or anika not a financial decision by nissan you know what did the accountants make the decision because i can't imagine an engineer wanted to do this you know after his hat i think it's the financial part of nissan which has forced this lack of tbn [music] of not including one of the most important things to an eevee car this is i can't even comparative combustion because there's nothing but i could say with a combustion engine if you leave it away it doesn't just work and it's that gross of saying it so basically i could say even if i'm not suffering from is basically a tv come with them the thermal management is crap because it's just crap so i think it was definitely a financial decision for making the car more attractive on the market because i think in the end it counts if you are communicating for less than 31,000 pounds then saying for just five to three thousand pounds because that's a psychological thing if the people compare the yun dae-ho yannick electric to for this sudden leaf and i see well it's well it's the same i don't need that much lush exterior i don't need the led lights and there is a missile leaf but it cost two thousand bucks more for this i can can go in holidays i take the noon day but this maybe even on same level and communication the tv commercials when i driving these highly produced thai and produced we're driving with a pro pilot and fascinating stuff and only for thirty-one thousand pounds or euros and that's a cost aspect because it's it's maybe a i think it's it's it's if if someone said is working for this i'm in the position of an engineer saying hey i've tested it now with my team for two million two million kilometres and we've got to the ship to the decision of not including a thermal management this is not an engineer this is maybe someone from from a house greenkeeper from a golf court yeah who just got a job as an engineer somehow because it couldn't be a logical decision it's definitely a positive feeling in my eyes definitely and it's a pity but this sun doesn't give you the option for these people to say you can buy it with the thermal management or without a thermal management and even if it's 2,000 euros many people would buy this honey i would would pay this money i wouldn't but having the decision is always better as a client before you buy something so much might be then of not having it and suffering from something there was a cost yeah yeah absolutely right to anyone on the live chat if you want to ask any questions now and can do that in a few minutes so put them up there there's several people talking on there and mainly the thing is a lot of people and i've seen this on my twitter feed quite a lot the good waiting for the 60 kilowatt hour version but what i do want to mention is that at the moment the 40 leafy's is by yourself there's no competition given the range and value obviously tests that are just significantly more expensive and every other evey has a fair bit less range but i assume it's the same in germany the ionic here as a near 12-month where in least the i3 i think is about five six months the zoe it's getting better cost of obviously just updated it i think that's about five to six months for that the leaf effectively is the only care i mean my car if i handed it back under the finance agreement are probably keeping it but if i did it'd be going back at the end of july i couldn't order any care other than the leaf now and get it for that date because it's the only one available every other year the e-golf is nearly 12 months for the waiting list in it's almost the dog wanted people to quit without yeah yeah that's the only one that doesn't with but that's a cab that's been adapted for an alert to be electric with the leaf being ground up you would have thought it'd have been there but anyway that's one thanks so let's gone to the uk germany difference between the charging infrastructure just to give you an idea my nearest public charger and this is a slow charger so it says three kilowatt is about yet is about twelve miles from me the nearest rapid charger oh that's probably about 19 to 20 miles and the you know i mean this is how bad it is there are parts of the country that are much better of course but where i live and it's not exactly in the middle to noah where i live in yorkshire you probably won't know other is boys it's more of the rural side of the uk and there are three rapid charges across two cities it's about a million and a half people living in these two cities leeds in bradford and there are three rapid charges for all of these and i live kind of near them there's literally nothing i genuinely couldn't survive if i didn't have off-road parking and in the uk 60 percent of houses have off-road parking which means forty percent don't so could you survive if i suddenly ripped your home charger out do you think if you wanted to you could survive with the german public charging infrastructure where you are now yes i'm complaining about it hearing this i was trying to find your google maps right now just to see you have to say that music is a really big city yes i live near skipton if you want to find yorkshire is the biggest county in the uk so it's yeah so it's my nearest charger is about two minutes of driving away it's a 11 kilowatt type 2 or 22 kilo of my time too but that doesn't help because any way they can get six kilowatts with the leek because only has one place charging but if we just go away from leaf my nearest this two minutes away and there is another one two minutes away at a car dealer then the next let me call it pathway rapid charger is 22 kilowatt target supermarket it's 800 meters no two kilometers away sorry 2 kilometer stove hmm how many miles 1.2 my way where i can charge with about 20 kilowatts and the more will you drive downtown the more of these charges you can find located ads yeah parking spaces and stuff so even if you just pull away email three charges nearby i'd still have another one yeah and my my first rapid charger my really rapid charger is where i charged in my rapid yet this is on the highway located at a service station and it's about 80 kilometers away so it's 40 minutes 40 minutes to get there and it's worth it if i say okay oh spontaneously i have to drive somewhere in a few hours i'd rather either go there charge and i have a charging cart for me from from a company where you pay five cents per minute and five seconds per minute is if you charge 45 minutes yeah so it's it's euros at something so it's ridiculous especially compared to running in combustion engine so it's a good infrastructure and i also have yeah you know yeah yeah yeah yeah that one in the uk has a rapid charger or two here as well here as well and they are just just optimizing every week here in germany now we had 50 years here in germany and my closest six kilometers away from me and they also have four triple charges so four triple challenges way chat about ccs and tied to and four of them so actually i can't complain no but the problem is still at the supermarket for example if i drive fair it's a dual charger knows also triple trying to sell you have chat demo ccs and type 2 but you only have one parking operat no recharge one car at the same time and ever since i have received my leaf i went there five times and three of these five top at least five times someone was charging someone was charging he was just arriving ten seconds before welcome to eb world before and that's the only problem and that's the same problem with every child except do you have full triple charge a second here because you can quite can be quite sure that they're not gonna be occupied because car drivers for occupying for triple charges actually here yeah i mean i did a bit of a kind of research when cousin as i said before we were going to drive all the way across europe and do the alpen strasser in the leaf and i wanted to see if he could have first of all most do it and they just seemed to be charging infrastructure in most of the towns along the road itself and it just seemed that the euro per minute i guess it's different because you're all kind of you know you can drive across europe whereas the uk is by itself so it's always lags behind aldi and lidl for example i just started to do a bit of a rollout in the uk legal moss or donalda and i'm pretty certain in germany would it be right that pretty much every aldi house charging infrastructure supermarket is where i have this charger where i was talking about two kilometers away from me and there is another one not being so far also having it but many don't so i have in the closed environment about 10 kilometres circle i have five are these and three or four of them have one well the more you go downtown so i live in unique but not downtown munich in the city are these you don't so then you still need to watch out for the yeah for the regular ones yeah so if you if you would in rural germany i can't think of apple a7 - what would that be as bad as where i am here do you think he's just a numbers game for now for the charging you know the cities are fine the cities are where that put them because that's where the people are but you know i mean no no along the year the motorways and highways there okay but ultimately once you peel off into a small town is that kind of just this is what i wouldn't recommend because i know it from practical example that my parents live 45 kilometres away from me unique i live here can you see that yeah yeah boys five kilometres away and of course when i wanted to go that time i thought okay if i stay there for about 3-4 hours maybe there is charging possibilities there is but there is no rabbit charger it's hard to find a 22 the kilowatt charger so as a visitor it's maybe a bit shitty but if you live there and just the same time you have to say okay if you buy a tv car we've come automatically again to the point of view what i was explaining at the beginning 90% of these people have a garage and they're charging overnight and with the current miss early faulty kilowatt hour if you talk my job the night you really really really need to drive a lot to to have any kind of range issues i've been driving around today i started with 80 81 percent today and i don't sixty kilometres and i arrived with 57 percent now and i'm from 60 kilometres and also highway driving under 20 kilometers power so not the most efficient way in the city traffic we're in a city traffic that missile if consumed ten point eight kilowatt hours on kilometres per 60 miles in the average so that's fantastic due to one pedal driving so it's it's worse in the places in india you don't live that much in just central core of the biggest titty me yeah germany it's better but still not comparable to norway no no i don't think anything is is it really that's why yeah i'd love to drive there i'll just go there and rent something because i mean he said fantastic scenery so that that's what always yeah i mean i don't know if you've even heard of the north course 500 in scotland and it's i've done that in a tesla and it's um the mini astonishing for that alone it's worth doing so i'd love to go on our way just to see both i suppose it's anything he's chicken in the egg the infrastructure has to be there for people to get the cars but the cars need to be there for people to justify putting money into charges so it's it'll get there eventually it's getting better each year incrementally here i'm assuming it's in there and there are european networks coming around now the ayane tea that they're rolling out across euro so hopefully they are going to be as good as we hope they are and the enables people to drive but by the time these come all will probably be in three four hundred mile range v's anyway so the charging infrastructure is less important suppose so if you are new in this emo bility segment in germany i'm still totally annoyed by having the necessity of carrying around five cards having downloaded six apps because this charger is is this company this charge of this company this company charges you seventeen cents permit this company charges in five cents per kilowatt-hour so it's it's such an effort and you really have to sit down and read and check out carefully where you charge because it's also the question of money it's not i think you could pay easily every of these charges without getting poor but the it if you know that maybe there is a possibility of charging for three or for a safe 5 times cheaper then you sit down and just watch out on the internet okay which is the cheapest possibility and and this is the problem some why nowadays with this technology that we have available why can't maybe one card or at least your credit card are going there just do it that nick that's a chop budging and you're gonna get charged even if the price is diff okay the prices shall differ but not the ways of paying for it because i think there is 20 different ways of 20 different companies hiding behind these charges and that's - it's so annoying i i haven't just yeah i have until now for for taking this time for checking out everything you have to order these cards you need to sign up on the website and that's [ __ ] so why can't we just go there this is the biggest issue my eyes with e-mobility doesn't matter where you are especially if you drive to foreign countries it's in the i live in munich driving two hours i'm in italy or even lot less i've been in italy i'm lost you i miss switzerland and even there it's more confusing because maybe don't speak the language okay luckily if i'm german you can swiss people understand - and the austrian people understand you and i speak italian fluently because my wife is italian but if you don't and you drive to italy they sent me in front of a charger you can't see what do they tell me now what do i need to do who do you ask how much time does it take to ask yeah it's a common thing for a few you know i've been three years evy driving in is it paying in the back side when the the uk of bringing legislation in in november so all charge points public a publicly accessible charge points have to of pay-as-you-go access which were hoping basically means contactless payment as pass legislation so all charges in the uk at least should be hoping contactless payment by november because that will be the law and say one card to rule them all as it were would be a debit card or a credit card because everybody's got one of those and it you know it seems easy maybe one common card or a little currencies imagine using currency to pay for fuel for your car whoa actual money to pay for fuel who thought that yeah it is is a common book bear yeah it really is and it's only gonna get more annoying than more common electric cars get of course and so we're up to were practical to an hour now and [music] some things wonder if miss sun could get close to the mk1 lisa's world european car of the year was so fancy he's a taxi driver as it points out with a new leaf i'm not sure i think he's got the best electric cara walter and they have no idea about the european one quite possibly quite possibly i've not looked if i'm honest but that name fact that that raises a point briefly he is a taxi driver got the leaf as it soon as it comes out it does seem perfect for taxis does if i kill all our leaf it's got the range to cover an entire shift and it saves them a significant amount of money of course and fuel so i think he leaves i think near birmingham oh yeah yeah sorry yeah yeah he's in the uk and i think that is a thing because when people start gain taxes and start getting into electric cars as a common thing if taxis are getting them all the sudden piggy's more in the public consciousness there's a city in scotland called dundee most of their taxis are the previously for now obviously they're going to the other leaf as well they've been doing this for a few years there's the cnc taxis in carmel which is south england they've got a fleet of about eight with their own rapid charges to use for the for the taxi rank and they say the same about i think it was the star looked seven eight thousand pounds per year on fuel lament and in toulon and because they've got their own rapid charges the taxi onkyo there's no infrastructure they can charge for free overnights maybe or just i was drive anything else new taxi driver no question yeah belief comes to its benefit with its high range of 300 is mostly drive in a city yeah really easily drive 300 kilometres and i think you want to 300 kilometres per day and you can charge overnight and even if not and you need more drive quickly to fast charger plug it in and in germany well i can understand done it and you've said you don't want to do a long journeys in your leaf but from someone who knows many of them partly for videos partly for fun partly because i saving money i'm from yorkshire that's what we do here especially the young child i find that it's a more relaxing journey because you're gonna stop anywhere on a four or five-hour journey ice with a young child yeah yeah exactly so i find that actually if would you take in the other car the only difference is that i'm driving about ten mile an hour slower on the motorway i'll be stopping anywhere for probably 20 30 minutes just for them so you know when there's just one person in the car both absolutely i'll probably just go straight down not stop but when you get family changes things i find so i do encourage you to do at least one decent journey in it and even quite they even get involved in plugging the caring weed out it's good fun and it bricks the journey up a lot as well i find so they get less itchy and i want to get out the car you know because you're getting out of the car you're walking around play around for a bit and then you get back in and you've got another hour enough and then you're getting out again so time is a big thing but it's because my my example my my perfect example is always really closer there is the garda lake 400 circular words away from me and i need to charge once at a rapid charger and then again the second time for about 15 minutes and as i can't drive faster anyway that kind of return in italy because in italy they really have hot polish but it's not in germany if you drive fast in germany you pay a few euros and it's time but it's whistle and austria italy they really they just slit your throat if you try fast so you can try faster $510 20 your batteries aren't gonna overheat so you can randomly charge at the first time of that issues drive off again and you do stop anyway with the child if it's now 20 months old or five years old you've gotta stop anyway yeah eat something go to the toilet and these 45 minutes passed by really really quickly and you can drive off again and you charge only once again for 15 minutes even if you don't have to do anything eating or going to time 15 minutes it's really long time and you arrive and if you are really careful with selecting the other charges because there are also miss are card dealers on the motorway you can charge there for free also in italy and you can find we're not paying even one cent for for for charging your car yeah and that's why i say we shouldn't be operating this thing so that's why i say if you have as a conclusion a range of 450 kilo 450 to 500 kilometres this is 300 miles in this circle he's driving you're not going to suffer from charging speed if you live everywhere except dubai and arizona but most of the listener relief buyers do you live in europe and even if it's paid even if it's italy where it gets a bit warmer my wife is from south italy they have really really hot and lots of days 35 degrees permanently even their [ __ ] car in a garage you won't have problems don't buy it confidently because this is my opinion you know i kind of suffer this it's it's so much panic i mean if you type it and replicate on youtube you're gonna have bitterly critical punch in your face of and then of course additionally if you read the comments of so many yeah i just test drove this piece of [ __ ] yesterday and i recognized the same he didn't he just right if you're so many people so much against ebe mobility and so much fighting against it they can't wait to find anything speaking against it and then they are rewriting this strength and say yes it's [ __ ] because i can see it in the comments of my rapid gait where i said it's not gonna happen to you for drive normal streets what you have to do everywhere except the germany yes punching punching punching at you have to imagine that you're driving uphill in on the route 66 with four people and they just stuck in the middle of nowhere i get a lot of people on youtube manly telling me how he's torn electric car and they've never even sat in one it's amazing how all these experts come out on youtube and and yeah yeah i always say i try i try and always be fully honest if i had a single cat i wouldn't have an electric car right now if i didn't have off-road parking at a drive or a garage i wouldn't have an electric car right now he doesn't sue everyone yet as a second car i think they are perfect in everywhere because the survey money they're easier to drive my wife was very nervous when we first got it obviously we had the backup but she came to love it very quickly so it's i don't know if they again if they did it across europe but nissan used to do a four-day test drive for the 24 and 30 leaf so you could really get an idea of how how good it was all about or whether it fit your lifestyle and that for me was key into getting one because we had it for four days we took it to work we see fit yeah and it's the easiest thing in the world to drive it's point-and-shoot practically isn't it and so it worked for everyone yet but it's coming you're not going to stop this electric revolution no matter what people say it sonics we're hybrids we'll be around for a long time i'm sure but you know when when porsche are bringing the mission ii out which is gonna be the game changer for me because it will be the first electric car i think where people want to put it on the wall the poster you know when you get a teenage you're putting an electric car on the wall that for me is when the culture will start changing the generational culture so we said they will grow up that when your daughter he gets her first cow and mine as well i am sure it will either it'll be at least a hybrid or electric just because by then most things will so it's working environment do lots of reviews for folks and morgan some inside and within the next twenty twenty two folks was so incredible and unbelievable evie cars on the market where we can we can talk confidently about within the next five years range of 600 kilometres easy be a tidy concept cars is over at the end the id concept cars which aren't that much concept anymore in the background because they have it they drive around with them here and they face these three hunters 360 miles with them or 600 kilometres but of course there is many things in the back remember they still have to do for putting these cars on the streets just having public access and i mean there is 110 kilowatt hour battery the id vision for example and it works and it drives and it faces 600 kilometers so within the next 5 years it's going to happen a lot and we leave that link where everything changes because as soon as a car in my eyes just i saw what you say no it doesn't fit everyone's needs yet but as soon as a car can drive 600 killed it's not wlt people not and if see this kinds of promising never fulfilled stuff no realistic 600 kilometers everyone can drive an e car because it's not just but batteries in the range that's going to get better and better it's also the charging because it 5 years you gotta have access so it's not just because nowadays you already have these 350 kilowatt chargers and the car's got it capable for taking 350 kilowatts so if you have a hundred kilowatt hour battery in a box or whatever and you can charge your 350 kilowatts this means that within an hour as it gives you three times more energy be know your battery capacity years it takes three times less than an hour so about let me say 20 minutes until charging from zero to 80 percent and then no combustion engine the driver can say anymore that he can't doesn't suit or doesn't match his neat because no one could drive six hundred kilometers even solo if you drive in without anyone just that and in germany the speed limits gonna be more and more so germany in about 10 years there's not gonna be saying today where you can drive from munich to berlin in about four hours because if you're driving at night you can't drive 320 kilos however if you to with a lamborghini there's no speed limit but that's kind of changed for it more and that's going to come to a benefit will be cars because if you're not allowed to dry out faster the holy trinity on it finds you anyway and of course no one's got a criticize that you need to drive slow with the e car because you can't you're not allowed to drive past them yeah yeah i've got many surprises by many car makers even from car makers that you don't expect them to surprise you within the next five years where you got to see well it does seem to be the the lesser known manufacturers are embracing this kia with obviously the sole and now the niro that's coming out it's a chance i think for lesser manufacturers if you in numbers terms to really propel them to the front i mean it's it's what everybody's looking at and the kyani raw for example has got a lot of press at the moment it's gonna have a a good range it's coming now and there's not much else to compare it against right now so i think there's there's a lot of background stuff sake went out that we probably don't even know exists yet and it's all twenty twenty onwards certain the more on it seems but but it's an exciting time i think it genuinely feels a change in you know mike when when i think of an analogy really a big difference in the automotive world is happening right now you know not just changing tv but it's the old kind of culture behind it the thoughts the lack of noise i mean one question i don't want to ask city you had an m135i before we've sports exhaust and all that the petrol heading you must be missing yeah putting the windows down on a country road going through a tunnel you know there must be times where you think oh i mean i do i love i love both cars you can a petrol and an electric cat i cows in general so and and i do sometimes miss driving the x it's a mini cooper s and sometimes i think no i'm gonna grab some foam today i'm going to take that so do you you get as i entered your head yet once the kind of novelty wears out where you think you know i wish i had someone with a good exhaust in this weather the aspect of not paying even a diamond driving is more impressive to me than the missing engine set and i was really really really a car and it sounded susie asked performance exhaust system and it was really roaring nothing else was really even the maserati drivers were looking at peace sometimes this car passed me by i'm missing it because we have many many m 140 eyes yeah gorgeous and ferrari commuting money is you've got many of them driving around and then i say cook it's not why don't have i this because it was my decision and i knew what am i'm trading my car for and i think it's also the aspect of having a daughter have been more calm by driving now because the car doesn't have this acceleration doesn't have this top speed it's more so i'm a lot calmer now it's just this i'm more relaxed and it gives me more i think more life quality than what i'm losing with with my sister linda bmw got the first rules of law when diesel's can't drive into a car drive down town and it's gotta be the same with munich and sunday when they just jumped off for diesels they're gonna start with a petrol petrol engines because maybe didn't have diesels but they have a lot of higher fuel consumption what about the porsche cayenne turbo asks with this massive weight with this bad aerodynamics consuming about 27 liters per 100 kilometers per 60 miles mmm this tea is co2 do you can you could carry the co2 it could do some workout with with a co2 any brilliance i'm so happy of having got a richness of this problem that i'm right now not missing it but maybe it's going to come up again but right now really this is when i say you can believe that everyone else can face it as well because i'm really i was totally my car sometimes i went down and just push the ignition just for hearing it even if i didn't need you to drive anyway oh yeah i'm fully aware i mean that the one thing how i've been curious at is there's a big modding scene in germany as there is in uk housing car modifications you know dobson stuff that i used to be part of it that my favorite cat of all time the only one i truly miss i've ever owned is is this lovely little beast there the corrado vr6 i used i love that cat to base but i often wonder what the the modding community when everything's electric will be doing it's not they're gonna change the exhaust on it or something that to make it louder you know they're gonna strap bigger batteries to it you know is it gonna ruin the the modding community not because i think you could even with the leaf if you open it find ways of making it more powerful then of course range goes lower but i think the tuning community or the big tuners will find ways of i think they are currently doing it finding ways of tuning et cars but maybe it's not necessary at all because if you take a look at it noticed i leave just to saying as a big comparison - ugly it's 550 watts power has an acceleration from 0 to is 65 kilometers power the current golf 7 gti performance which has 245 horsepower so hundred horsepower more so than keeping up with a missile native at a greenlight battle you need 100 ps more for keeping up not for passing by for keeping to keeping up so if you buy a tesla now i think there is no reason for tuning it so maybe this will be sunday the end of of the tudors of the money companies because what you want what is it say what you'd to do there's at a slurpee hundred d you can't accelerate faster than they still go well yeah i guess it's as well yeah visions of all these teenagers going to know what teenager ten years [music] it's a change of culture he's definitely i think our generations gonna have this time of it but it's an exciting time i'm looking forward to what's coming up manufactures actually seem to put in an effort into new stuff now and you mentioned the beliefs acceleration of recently other nine three becoming soon booked and i read in several places so i'm assuming it's true because it's on the internet that the i3 is the fastest accelerating bmw 230 and that's including m3 m5 s oh i mean a no it's this kind of useless statistic but it's quite an interesting one when something that is quicker than their much powerful about forty five kilometers i think per hour do you know the exact accelerator time of the food two-thirty i couldn't tell he's got he's got hundred and seventy brake horsepower and a cabin fiber body of course so it's the i3 aren't so far away from each other i would check out quickly because i have uploaded in german german forum a photo with the comparison between the golf centre gti performance and the leaf and there you can see the acceleration time i'm quite curious here i found it just let me see from zero to 40 from zero to fifty kilos now it's 2.8 seconds and from zero to 40 km/h it's two point two seconds so traffic grand prix [music] the difference from off the line and even if you have the same acceleration time you are off and his acceleration time even if it's the same only he starts by jumping off the line but until he has stunted so you've already gone yeah because it's starting with an eb car on full throttle at a green light it's comparable more to launch control starts going to do launch control starts as a green light because even even the thirty leaf is quicker than most standard cars and it is quite amusing when you get a modified i know cle or something you know with a 20 year olds not kidding it and you know quite angry i find but he's quite amusing but well yeah it's three litre v6 diesel aldi's i have really embarrassed the green light i could hear that he accelerates but he had no all fun and games in you right well i could carry on talking forever but i better not because we'll end up breaking youtube and but but yeah this has been good fun i do look forward to some point hopefully next year it should it was gonna be this year but next year of actually visiting somewhere in germany i'm hoping the alton strasser cuz it looks awesome so if i'm obviously very much in your area there will certainly yes we have a few of the friends in germany as well so probably ever do it do at our might even go around the nurburgring as a leaf ever gone the round the nurburgring and be curious to know that someone's got--someone's done it already oh i can tell ya that the i don't need if you've ever been to the goodwood festival of speed it's a mile and a half track the fastest car to do that and everything has gone up this from 1960s ferraris to the bugatti chiron last year the fastest car to do that backwards is the nissan leaf the remove the restrictor so you could go back backwards in the leaf as fast as you can go forwards so they got stuck they've got a stunt driver in it and he basically went up the the hill run if you so it's got the record for the goodwood festival of speed going backwards as the nissan leaf still i guess i guess we just stumbled across what some of the modding community might be doing right ok well thanks for watching guys everybody on the chat kenneth i will hope to see you down at the fully charged live event which is silverstone in a couple of weeks now he's from canada just so you know he's kenneth baca he's a tesla model 3 i know he's i know that he's from canada and he's canadian because he's got the youtube levy revolution sure now i think it's called but but yeah that it's got to come from somewhere the nez perce and so when he when he sees that well you never know turns out your long-lost cousins he's saying yes apparently it is that the streamlet is a bit of a delay there so if you guys would leave just just check out my library on my because i have i have reviewed the dystonic beef and i'm sometimes i mean they're just i'm not trying to do the competition with you leave 40 kilowatt hour i will be uploading things comparisons between eco mode and normal mode doesn't really make a difference and many other things because days weeks anytime just well the link to the car mania youtube channels in the description below of this and for anybody that does want that and so it's i mean it's because of use for the disa leave are horrible i mean i have about five hundred fifteen thousand ds of my polo do this leaf has currently 5307 and that shows how small basically the interest of easy cars is compared to the combustion engine because well if you go out of the leaf before it came out that would be where higher and obviously you have access to a lot as soon as bmw do something or volkswagen that you have access to that i am not in any way jealous about then you will get the views of course i'm sure when they're being a full electric 3-series out if you get older that before it comes out with the general public i'm sure i'll get tons and tons of use because it's early access in it that's the hardest thing i found and i've done this town with in over three years i can see the leaf reviews are not really having the comparable no each it's it's not in the public consciousness as much is it it's not a sexy cab but people gonna google and want to watch a youtube over a leaf tearing around a track so i think you say it's i find it's a steady climb of views rather than a massive hit and then it stops because there are always people i mean ever i've got i'd say probably hundreds of messages now over the past few years from people who have watched various tv channels not just my own and have gone on to buy one because the same videos mine yours and he's given them the confidence to actually go and buy one because the don't you know say the manufacturers or rather the dealers pretty much know nothing though that you get the good few i mean i had an argument with a dealer in january before the leaf was launched he was adamant and wouldn't take no for an answer that the new nissan leaf was only coming with one pedal it you know i read no no no it's a de pedal you still get a brake pedal it no no no so only one pedal is this man and he doesn't he was selling them i mean you know no no there's a couple out there that are very good but ultimately yeah yeah there's not a lot the probably not a lot of profit in the in evey market i suppose yet so will so yeah it's it'll be interesting i think they're gonna have to retrain a lot of them but to be honest were they any better with a combustion engine and dealers that much up on the new paul or you know if i if you asked him about the new polo gti i'm sure there be probably as clueless as they were how about the leaf in real terms sir so i guess it's nothing new but but yes so kenneth i will probably talk to you in a couple of weeks in person because i believe you coming over to the uk for that and may even do another i prefer doing live streams because there's no trophy and editing involved and i'm it gets it gets you on a topic in a discussion that you who knows where it goes so i'd to carry on doing this with various people around the world that i will never probably physically meet in america or canada or europe hopefully i will but ultimately this this for me is more enjoyable didn't than doing a traditional so that there will be more i just need to find someone interesting to talk to us that's the next step so yes that's been it's been good fun and so for everyone on the chat thanks for watching for everybody that's watching it after the fact again thank you it'll be more of this again for those that have been mentioning that they haven't got a notification valve live videos you have to on the little bell symbol on the subscription and all to get all notifications on the i'll probably do with something separate on that so chris thanks very much for doing this it's been it's been good i will probably to you off and on over the coming months i'll keep an eye on your and hopefully i'll get out to germany at some point next mir we are apparently going towards law for her my wife's 40th probably in a car as well so i don't know if you ever go where northern germany end you could always intercept us somewhere or even me as in who knows and so yeah it's been great guys thanks for watching chris thank you i shall stop streaming now so bye everybody and i'll see you soon",4
Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK3WKwmReTmSFjf3mjWm4MJZ,2BZ1P0697wU,"[music] hi guys and welcome to a bit of a trial this is with child this before but never with this other layer so you see so thank you for being the guinea pig and the live stream test i suppose this is the first proper one that hopefully will be staying on the and as the title suggests it's about people who can't charge at home i mean i have an electric car i could charge a home it's very easy it's the thing that most people particularly say oh i'll just charge it on it's easier but the person i'm talking to i'm not sure if you want to it until i call you el l&r or you will probably know her if you're on twitter with your she's electric twitter tag and you're on that you're quite prolific on the old twitter there but and so so basically the reason why you're here is because you don't charge or you can't charge a home right and i stay in a flat and sunny dundee and i am fortunate to have unallocated parking space and so when i was looking at getting eyelid current i did look into getting old charger and i had a couple of different people come in i my my parking space from a couple of installation companies i we do have lacing in the car park so i thought oh there's power there we might be able to do something and one company said yeah it shouldn't be a problem to put it into the lacing system and then another company came out and said i would i would touch their support and the power that we need but also although i've got my own parking space it's across the car park from my building so the length of cable to go it was going to cost an absolute fortune so i thought well we'll just see how again [music] and why did you choose so you can charge it working that's prolific bonus i mean can you tell us a bit about dundee it does seem to be well significantly ahead of most towns and cities in terms of charging infrastructure i mean i have nothing nearby literally no fast nor slow nor rapid not nothing at all so obviously done they seem to be going nuts almost ready to charge points about the hopes now electric car and pencil and indy so proactive and even before in the hub's i think there's at least twenty places that you can charge across the city as a woman and undies quite a compact city you could probably get from one side to the other and about twenty minutes to half an hour and so we're quite compact and one of the big things for us as well that one of our local taxi companies really really got on boards as well and they were one of the first i'm guessing in the country possibly across europe to install their own hub where they put five rockets and themselves and as i said there's ones that are all all over the city and they've had the vision to start installing and the charging hugs the fresh ones open already and you may have seen some pictures on online and of that and there's an off key and which about fifteen minutes free from my flat and there's another two planned one is literally a stone's throw away this could have six rapids and it and one and the next time up from dundee this still under the dundee council a little technical property that there's going to be another hub and big part to play and it is the tents themselves have a vast fleet of electric cars and the university of dundee and quite a few charging points and those are the ones that are used at my work and also the nhs and two sides have got quite a few and edie's running about and the light roslin 39 wheels is a rapid charger there and there's some fast chargers as well so a comedy should the council the nhs the universities are no local businesses is quite a few vans you see some you be 200 organ about the the total companies so it's gradually snowballing and or more people are realizing bazooms a lot of private people can't pick up the infrastructure is there so as that includes duplicate uptake do you think of the actual chasm dum di zhi just yeah it's obviously helped because it has it made people think of them time a new thought one because you saw the charge pointing yeah that may make a difference do you think we're coming up to 90 electric taxis in dundies lots of people on a daily basis you know it's their run to school run to work or whatever they're experiencing being an electric car or where there's somebody through the work the university or any chase drives and evey today i mean there may be oh i can actually run one of these myself as well so i think it's just bringing them to the public forefront because if you just drive into the city within a couple of minutes quite view different electric cars always past you so i think it's becoming a normality no really it seems to be a bit of a scottish thing as well and i've recently come back from the north course 500 and inverness that's not quite a few electric buses is there as well with its electric chicken okay about a third of the book sees were definitely barrier there between scotland's need to embrace in it a lot more started in england and definitely the wheels and which is which is a good thing because hopefully he's proven that it's easily doable the next question i guess is if you have to move of the outside of scotland if you have to move there i say over the course a scholar named ed him if you have to move to a debride he didn't have off-road parking could you still survive do you think i think could be a lot more difficult andras capture the moment and before i was and i've only been in dundee five and a half coming up six years and i was sitting in the west end glass school before i moved through and i think even though i would probably be struggling but wouldn't be anywhere near easy as for me a lot of the infrastructure is coming i don't think it would be quite as easy as i wait there's a lot more charging points i think that's gonna be a huge thing for for people's doubles your commute you might have a shorter range evie but you can charge at your work doubles your range yeah yeah of course so important and it doesn't always need to be does need to be about the chargers even fast charges if you got a rule of three pen plugs most people by the end of a working day you have enough charged yeah so i guess we kind of stumbled on the key thing for people that don't have off-road parking he's literally the lock luther structure and work would be a key point and boy if if you after two and half years of not being able to do this at home can survive but you couldn't somewhere else i guess in a lot of places where i am now if i didn't have a driver i've linked to the couldn't survival answer so i suppose it's the counter do you know if the council came before the private sector in dundee was there a who's responsible for this with each other working together to create what they what they caught and a moment and we need to kind of things that the university would really quite early it don't go things that when i first came sit on g toes for some of the first touch points and i think it's been a little bit of both kind of simultaneously and it's kind of forward now this seems to but there's a grant now i believe so the i think it's in scotland as well a government grant which helps councils pay for unrolled parking 75% towards the charger and accounts we'll have to check that in the last quarter for that and i know there was some big crowds going around that the dundee quite a reasonable slice i think they would only score two shitty when there was a big bit and i know and there's trying to member which manufacture is that again on their website you can go in and kind of almost request one in your i think they're looking for people to let them know weird points points are needed and as well i know there's some companies the lamppost charges i think oxford and lucy i believe yeah yeah i mean so there's a myriad and a myriad of options basically and but ultimately i think from a mass adoption but for more people to do it we're gonna need the council on board at least a third of car owners don't have a driveway or parking so that's a lot of people to accommodate i think as well as the moon charging and things that i think car shilling and things that no it's gonna be a big thing of the future as well and the majority of our cars are sitting there not doing very much for for most of the day and and also i'm sure that i was where but some of the charging points and dundee are shared with this cool wheels car club of charging point i use directly there's a week since on that that and you can hire and write about it so for people that reality of running car every single day that they don't need to it can easily hi one of these ones and i think that a lot cheaper to run than the equivalent or diesel car from coriolis car club but don't think it has and fuels another incentive for again people getting painful view of a tv potentially for the first time so with y'all reason other than blackmail from cousin wells it's an ecological decision i was that a financial i mean i got one primarily that the one that that made me go for that was because i do a lot of miles and it saved me a lot of money so i it was a financial decision firstly for me and then the ultimate it object toys in electric cabinet so there's a lot of appeal there was an ecological one first and foremost so they're usually several reasons in the first first of all but then i knew you'd be saving some money but i didn't realize how much i would actually be saving at the moment my leaf has done just about 23,000 miles and because most the charging in scotland is free i know charging to charge more common and more than happy to be what it does but i still spent less than ten pounds on charging so far we do get free charging there's definitely a difference this is the thing scotland seems to be where i think we were gonna say wait england needs to be and wales especially there's a lot of people on the comment saying wheels he's just talk black hole in terms of charges and so there's it's obviously kind of coming from a both you know someone at dundee has obviously decided that before they've become semi mainstream and pushed it obviously the university has done some similar stuff when it could you survive without charging at work is there infrastructure there for that definitely when opens caused by ie to me i think that's gonna open the opportunity for electric cars why for the i stay in t s there's a lot of flats old older style and in a victorian built plants but with no parking and things that so there's a lot of people and and there's quite a few high-rises and dungey as well that home charging is just never really going to be a possibility and but the things that are coming in where though you leave the car for a couple hours or you come home and have a quick boost on the rafters huge difference across the city have you ever come across is it worth with not being able to chat here the university is offline or something yeah a bit have you ever been stuck well you know b- now in terms of evey driving because everyone always thinks that we could soft-pedal the truth when he seems to pushing evey so you know if some say buddy what are the worst parts about not being a charger call really affect he did kind of lifestyle i would say that i'm probably a bit more cautious than somebody that does of a whole charger because if i've been on a longer run and i'm heading home i know i'm not coming home to a charge that all they need to charge it work the next day so i need to leave a bigger cushion i got left green twice and or if i come home from a long journey and then i need to go at least to that day i need to be planning into that deed i need to go to one of the rapids to be able to take away again if i am doing a longer journey i will the night before if i really need things to be up to a hundred percent and i have to make climbs the day before whether i go to work or do something intended or go to the gym and 100% circle max might as well as people with home charges and they've got the light rail you know i need to feel feel tank tomorrow plug it and and i probably needs a little bit more planning and charger and it's maybe just generally that's a bit more cautious and make sure they've got enough juice to get me another charger yes i never run out we find by yeah by choice or otherwise it's it's usually ladies they're planning if you are a faulty chargeable to obviously we've got dozens of charges it seems near you it's not i guess you've got lots of plan b c's and ds down to the infrastructure again so i suppose that is ultimately the key a lack of off-road car dean for structure which is down to the council and various private people and if if you did move you potentially have to give up your car presumably just if you've got even leave for what i'm doing only need to charge once twice a week i'm just on a 24 kilowatt leaf at the moment so i just plug it in a couple of times a week for the majority of people i think the average commute is about 20 miles s so for most people they could do a good couple of titans in a week without having to charge so as i said it's just going to get easier and easier as the master new capacities increased that is gonna be demands and going longer between charges yeah i mean i when i went for the 25 to the 30 just for that little bit of extra it made a huge difference because sometimes because i come on from work my wife goes to work so because we're a town so we both use the catholic communion and there were times where i do too many miles because i go all over the place and she'd have to say at the other cap with the 30 that almost never happens even in winter just that extra about 20-25 miles so has made a huge difference so with the 40 i don't think he'd ever happened so yeah i said the bigger bucket something you if you're at two and half years i'm guessing the other three year deal back or even the 40 caliber running into what some people are seeing on social media so i'll need to have a little bit i think i'm also possibly keen potentially to buy my my leaf out rate and keep its majority of my dd needs a great beard that i do a long commute but it would be nice i am i not possibly the 60 kilowatt when it comes out but it just seems that caps gonna be between my pc and their mind up in a couple of months yeah although that was to but the the price their residual values of the cars is way better and i think anyone thought the guaranteed future value always was always seen as a bit of a jerk really to make it cheaper but my car will be worth actually a fair bit more than the guaranteed future value and i always assume it'd be the other way around yeah yeah i mean i mostly done better-looking says he said there's such a long lead time and i mean the irony keys up to a year the eagle fear about the same i think the kia soul well the first the nearest fourth kia dealer seems to me don't sell it and so we got the a on again i think that's 9 to 12 months so kind of when it leaves the leaf the new leaf as an option just to be a get one for when that in sir i think realistically keeping this care even if it's just for a few months or more and then selling it affluent until my year model 3 arrives with cast first day reservation yes just over 2 years i put the farm pack in 1000 pound where two years ago and macau it's probably about that before it turns up even assuming i can afford it i mean it's kind of bonkers really but yeah who knows it's i think i'll be keeping the 30 leaf because if someone said to me what car should i buy now i think they use 30 kilo our leaf 6.6 ward is the best value by far it's got enough range for most for is not a big jump and i think the 60 will be a significant jump up in cost just there were a lot of cheap pcp deals going out there on the leafs originally probably to get people into them i i was drunk i have one and a half cars and my friend and i am sheer obviously it's my dirty secret israel have kia sorento that we used to a horse box cause the leaf can to a horse unfortunately well yes i mean can the horse not tuck itself there he's not not the idea of the horse to tour the leafing region we've got about five minutes guys so if anybody on the chat wants to ask either it was mainly a question do so mainly it's just people complaining about their local charging infrastructure or lack thereof definitely you seem to be in a unique position in terms of what's available as we've said yeah so i think how far away do you think the uk's from being able from anyone being able to get much by them without off-road parking i mean 10 15 years seems a bit of a stretch even now to be honest because councils are jumping on it a lot of councils anywhere come to this meeting the other week time in london and they were all discussing this automates it's an electric vehicles bill that's going to be going through the house floor votes as soon so i think a lot of councillors are probably going to be forced into whether they want to or not and also with all the different capital used for emissions and things that and they're going to have have to israel but as well as the councils i think all the other private suppliers and things there's going to be an increasing market for it and money almost drives these things so if there's gonna be demand for it but it's just in everybody's singing from the same hymn sheet having strategically chargers and things i said a big big part it is i think charging is important and highly charging is important but for me i think the biggest thing which is all things driving an evs door to me is really being the workplace charger i think that's something and i think that i there are all they've grounds for businesses but it's just really getting that message out there to businesses that they could be installing them so i'm not sure whether that would come from the government or the cases or again employees kind of managers and and things in the right direction i think as well you see one person at work plugging in that starts a conversation other people see that yeah yeah i'm sure their experiences in the short time but they used to just be a couple of leaves using the points but you just seem more - were more electric cars and also we're really lucky as well that we can obviously use the chargers but the council of meets at 3:00 to park and our pen saloons parking and our parks so people are going awesome i can come and park for free one of the girls at my work has gone 24 kilowatt leafs 18 and she said nine pence each eod and parking and charge and really good space for words well yeah yeah exactly and about 160 70 pounds a month in fuel costs alone because i'll do about twenty thousand a year so i say the financial and that's how i always try and go down the financial incentive we weren't talking us of one because if you start going on to my ecology anything people just think you might be preaching so if you can save money that what makes people listen i said there has been a few people who spoke to the can charge of work who've we've had a bit of resistance from other employee say no i'm gonna they're getting free fuel from work that's not fair can you not give me free petrol mister employer has ever been anything that but not too much negative gain created police saying that this pieces if it's somebody's parked at one of the charges in the multi-storey that yes so they are actually have a pyramid so there's normally somebody coming around shaking them and the guys are quick especially as a whole for the public charges are there sometimes blocked are they looked after by the wardens i have seen them occasionally but again i have seen the warden tickets all of them so they they're pretty wise to all as well so that student discourages people if they get a ticket but again said well there's one five-minute sorry well yeah suppose i mean that i've spoke to not the auction county council yeah geographically a very large one and they basically said there's nothing wrong with that right our air quality we have no intention of doing this at this time even though there are several cities that go under the you know that the level that's recorded and and it's literally just the private sector we've got to rely on these goes through was quite quite spread out as north yorkshire isn't you know there's lots of the town the villages everywhere but ultimately there's no council backing and there doesn't seem to even the only green councillor in my area which is craven even he said that he's almost given up pushing it in the council and he's a council so i guess it's maybe they don't see the incentive all they see is that money's going out by paying for charges and may even be losing money on on making parking free i mean the leads for example is pretty shocking in terms of charges but they've made it free for anyone with electric ads back in the council kappa it's say that alone could be enough for someone to at least look into one and it's costing them practically nothing there's no outlyer there so those things that could be done ultimately as was in there that don't involve the council spending thousands [music] the purse from above or maybe the central government monday to tell he obviously works i never i never really had an idea of how we had work as a how a council could make people by obviously dumped under you've proven you just put them in there and me and they will come to seem to work quite effectively more more prevalent the daily basis is no uncommon to every other car and especially russia at the taxis and being just a few questions but manly one of them is did you enjoy your in a tesla i'm guessing you had one for a while oh yes couple of cores in a tesla but this time last last year i was treated to but for the weekends and by our anniversary weekend that my husband stephen surprised me by hiring more delays for white car myself in fact it was the exact same one that you had a year ago same register [music] well it was the depths of winter when we having ice on the inside of the range wise but i know many people do the creature comforts in a car yes it's is something i'm you do a one-off so you can you can hide the twizy for anybody's interest you can actually hide your tweezers in the lake district yes yes they have about six i think you have a couple in the past and me brother about this is around the lettuce tree the good fun there's a few people asking about the tesla higher-cost now i've looked at this recently and the several companies that do it but i know white power of just changed their pricing hundred twenty three pounds a day now okay the model s now it sounds a lot but refer back to the north course 500 that we did again we saved the boundary and 20 pounds in fuel costs because i mean just getting to inverness is hard enough and and there's no fuel costs with most higher companies to give you the card as well as the test of super charging so it's not actually as bad as people think really because if you do a lot of miles you can almost make the fuel in the daily cost and i did notice the the autopilot on the motorways was fantastic we got to inverness and you didn't really feel you were driving yeah yeah i mean you did drive we did you know we didn't do this or anything that but you felt tired maybe it's cause even after college as much as well people might say oh that's expensive but if you were to spend that much or want to hire an equivalent and super car something that's gone that speed you're gonna be paying that it's not probably more i should be honest yeah and thank you and my mind would be my my preference oh over over the tail of judy is car to be in so although it sounds a high ticket price if you compare it to obviously compared to hiring a ford fiesta prepares for further weekends and you're paying for luxurious and it's incredible corner so and for some people is is a treat it's not something you'd probably do it okay and that financial possession but yeah it was just great experience and you almost feel a vip cruising it and so worthwhile freighter but see this thinking of doing a longer journey and rather than their own car way but it's an eevee or diesel petrol car to kind of treatment sales and it's just enjoying it yeah yeah so i figured about them two quid a day if you take fueler and continuously it's a ninety thousand pound car yeah that's not bad how you run aston mine yes see how much that costs you of course yeah i think dara say it's an accessible premium car maybe because most you know if you said alright i've saved up enough afford and asked the man already used for out here eighteen ninety thousand pound car i couldn't afford to run it but i think someone mind you know it'd be a massive purchase you get tested but anyone can afford to run a test but because it's probably cheaper then across bst once you've got it yes sir once that kind of goes down into cheaper realms the model three leaves you know you can get leafs now for what but seven eight thousand pound upwards with know about release and you know becoming the news market is arriving now i think we're we're we're people who will say look i've got very little money this isn't they don't see the total cost of ownership i see i find you know the fuel costs and the pcp costs or the monthly cost at about the same i find there's a market to three thousand pound car with fuel and depending on miles of course but yes there's quite a lot of people some people thinking hundred twenty nine pound is expensive and i've guess it's all relative in the he came to cap in a hundred thousand man caravan and so yeah there's plenty of places online lots of people asking where from white calories just a website using just google white car testily you'll find one and a bride use i know they've got ones all across the an excellent experience wait wait cars been excellent we have to get the model x for the horse box i presume just i think this horse could live behind you as well so yeah it's the it yeah it's the luxury car people i find people look at the tesla as an electric car and forget the fact it's in ninety thousand he said looks rig is expensive because of what is not because it's electric and there's a lot of misinformation out there i find when it comes to v's in general yeah and as you know i don't know why in turn telling you that you obviously know that and so we've got a couple of minutes left no i said five minutes ten minutes ago and so last time last chance rabbit for any questions that you've got for either of us and thank you for doing this by the way we have chance to talk before we start to due to technical issues i want to do more of this type of interviewing if you from people across the world because that's the hardest bit i suppose worth asking will you be going to fully cast yes definitely gonna be there all day on saturday and sunday i just be whatever bird john and i could have fun see him back up the roads and in his taste i think we'll be there for a couple hours on the on the sunday morning before we we hate back but no really looking forward to it and it's gonna be fantastic to meet so many people that i interact with on a regular basis yeah so media that should meet them in person assists and excited just to see so it's gonna be going on the events and different speakers and and it's not just electric cars will be lot of renewables and these links to let your car something it's gonna be great yeah yeah hopefully i mean i'll be there sadly as well of course i think quite frankly i think anyone that does anything electrical related will probably be going yeah and the i went to they won the milton keynes event give them that launched the live thing that they did about november when they were trying to get sponsors i was there for that and i met quite a few people for you know james and care and louis from ii cows and it's kind of snowballs from that i said meeting people and then lead to other stuff so i say so i think just for being there with other people that are online a lot and evie evangelist ever see i think it's quite nice for that so yes question i don't have it i think it's crazy but my doesn't because it's quite a sunny city but it feels a missed opportunity but and when we do move to as happy s be able to be charging my car from from the solar panels as well running on pure sunshine yes yes it's just literally the cost i mean in fact that's some again that scotland has not sent mom to buy a car for this financial year as well [music] between five or six years 0% and has to be a new electric car and from the second time [music] i mean example to be a common thing that people get any diesel actually can do going back in the diesel or petrol car in general for the noise sometimes i think there's something wrong with it it's just making a noise when i'm when i'm used to silence and it's just such a physical cars to drive over the lease it's just easy it's just pointed belief that's great okay so he's not trying to persuade you to get it definitely i think will be a whale away before ever maybe for each one and beliefs checks all the boxes and permeate at the moment and only happy driving it and excited to see what's gonna be available next yes well everything appears to be 90 2020 literally everything is coming out in 2020 in fact if i hear that one more time i'm gonna scream and all the volkswagen stuff the tesla stuff and and and and everything exciting you got the key an arrow and a few other things coming out before the end but before we yeah trying for hours on end because i have a happy in a way on these live shots and people don't seem to think and now we're in our youtube is so right again thank you for doing this probably you don't know oh my god right so thanks for doing this thank you for everyone watching live and asking questions and i'll see you soon guys so thanks and i'll see you soon bye",1
Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK3WKwmReTmSFjf3mjWm4MJZ,DVG9TWuZShE,can't wash it back let me see if we can flip it around for you uh there we go now you've got a few uh decisions to make basically because oh camera's struggling on this one oh my phone camera's not liking this there we go uh we have four options we have bronze silver gold and platinum now i think we uh we need to set a certain goal over the next 10 minutes say oh my phone's not really liking it uh if we get how much we on now hurry i'll just double check now my phone really is very crappy we are on two thousand seven hundred two thousand seven hundred and ninety six so if we get to three thousand we'll say well what we are so two seven nine six uh let's call up two eight all right so if we get to two nine we'll go from bronze to silver now the difference is that bronze is just shampoo and wheel wash silver includes a high pressure sidewash yeah so let me flip it around again uh gold you thought you want me to see it but gold basically gives you high pressure side wash shampoo high pressure wheel wash wet dry [music] basically if you don't do that nope we're not going for the high pressure side wash that's what you gotta start off dude one second having some technical problems this is my uh there we go my view at the moment here we go right so right there they are so we have high pressure side wash side pre-wash or it if we go for gold active foam bath shampoo wash high pressure wheel wash duper bath yeah super wax and under chassis right so i i think we need 3 100 to go for platinum for platinum 3 000 for gold 2 900 for silver so wow so that's what basically you need to donate another hundred quid to get a silver 200 quid for gold and someone said they'd donate 30 quid if we just did this and someone else said they'd match it so this should be perfectly doable guys um this is going to happen yep yep we want to get to 3 000 pounds this is all for the charity the just giving link did i put that in this scheduled one if not i mean basically it's www dot ev hyphen man dot com at uk false last giving you'll take it to the just giving site it's on my twitter um link all over it it's on loads of my uh twitter sorry i'm coming in the chat now uh harry's putting it in the chat now so there you go um so until we get to you you're not getting high pressure sidewash until we get to 2 900. uh and then we'll go to gold which is 7.50 for for three thousand pounds donated three thousand one hundred will go for platinum which is super gloss polish so all the writing we've got on the outside of this car you're gonna have gone you know uh hopefully telling people what we do well hopefully yeah there she is guys uh you ain't got long left after you've got seven or eight minutes to get yeah you get donating so if you don't donate we're just having the boring wash yeah nobody will see that oh my camera why is it terrible uh so yeah nobody wants to see that one you want to put it on there put that on its side just a little bit uh is um i'm still very weak how are we doing how are we doing is good but i don't know why i've got really really oh everyone said it's that bad i think we've just got major delay on the text right all right okay um so we're uh four minutes away what's the uh well we have now let's account double check oh two eight would it two eight two six so that means when it's silver is that right i think so no no no no no this is a silver two there's two nine for silver oh come on i don't want to go through regrowth but i'm going to do this absolutely corn you gotta get three grand otherwise uh it's just a boring one i'm afraid but come down unless they aren't refreshed properly all right it's gone down someone's withdrawn so we're taking money out from second money i did say i'd donate to the car wash oh thank you mr fishbeit um nick riley david s style uh we're getting there how wet will we get we i have no idea we've got windows how i mean i think the um the brilliance of the tweezer will shine through and we won't get wet at all i think nice but we'll see we'll see all the electronics in the glove box uh right okay so come we just need an extra 40 quid keep refreshing it if it gets to three grand we're just gonna go for uh for the proper wash everything if you want what do you think i think we'll go all the whole way for three grand yeah we'll go the whole way for three grand you've heard it here okay that's my rate so yeah underwater and everything yep wash wax wetter than a ministerial aid someone's put [laughter] this cab dirt even matt hancock how much to do with the windows down i don't think that letters legally i mean um you don't want to see a wet t-shirt it only just gets yeah it only just gets us through the uh oh come on we're not far off plus i don't want a high pressure wash on the dash of this thing it's not that waterproof it's actually it's not waterproof no the dash is in for the rest of it two eight five six now two eight six six two eight six six so we're another 30 134 pounds away from from the full whack and in theory we're going to start this in one and a half minutes and stream the entire thing and yeah we're streaming it all um we may delay it another few minutes just to get to that three grand i think we should let's get some air in it's getting a bit warm get a bit warm in here getting toasted 98 people all it needs is a couple of quid each for those who haven't yet if you can afford it that'd be brilliant um that's the funniest thing you see all day or or not because we're not gonna get wet in this brilliant twisty turn the ac on we have done yeah we have to look for the window open here we go windows open yeah so uh yeah let me let me show you that it's going on a theme park right apart from there's actually the real chunks we might die yeah oh two nine or six trying two nine or six we're getting close guys let's get it to that three grand mark and then uh we can be wet and stickier in here we have the trial run just to make sure it does clear that yeah we have gone through it just to make sure it clears everything because there's an under seal watch whatever the hell that means i've got no idea i'm just noticing this rather large paddle gap just here down there i can get my fingers well yeah let me let me show you around the uh weaker part uh there's a full there's a car waiting behind there's a car over here ah three seconds should we go around uh yeah we'll let the other guy go through that gives you more time to get three grand oh you got a reprieve so somebody's somebody's queuing up so we can't really make them wait look at things become you can see what you're gonna get oh yeah oh let's sneak preview there's the rollers let's just run around again we're going back around oh it's a fed oh no it's an outlander fev which means he's going to stand there for an hour and not plug in right so once he's done then we'll go through um go on now so we're just waiting for him as soon as he's done we're off oh no that means we're gonna get a sneak preview of what's to come but yeah well you know what this might give us time to prepare do you ask him what he's gone for nah was he talking to someone oh tell me it's working it's better that's it for all this bloody build up i mean there's a hand get wash there there is a hand uh washed place around the corner from here we will do something i promise it doesn't say faulty it's got all the green lights on so it should be okay uh well we're waiting any questions uh about this eevees in general take your pick and efficient life decisions you've got to make we could never help with yeah yeah yeah yeah relationship advice harry's pretty good at relationship goodbye so yeah anything you want to know or advice on it how to get rid of certain things about you oh someone's uh super chat donated which is brilliant but that goes to me rather than that so i'm going to have to make sure i put that in later um what's the charge level currently oh eight five out of ten because we charged up at the uh pump oh so we're go oh the guys move forward so it's definitely working we're good let me switch around again uh what's going to happen oh it's squirting on it oh oh so i wonder if do we know what it's going for i can't tell can we that's hardly high pressure oh no look at what's in the bottom of the wheel wash what should we look just above that that jet that's quite what's that looks the first jet up a horse pipe going in oh that's going to go right through that big gap on the door [music] what's happening now oh some sort of misting mist this is coming from the side again i haven't done detailing before i don't recognize any of this they're only doing the side of the car for one not the back or the front is that is having a snowfall he's got to get off all the contaminants of traffic build up and stuff maybe a tfr well if he's gone to the top i don't know and that's that's the order up what's there oh just kung fu now they're already going down definitely gonna get it oh yeah yeah there's no way we're working out this one do you know what i think it may try to open the windows i'm gonna have to keep the bell down come on guys no not five or three thousand yeah until we get to three grand we're not going in there oh it's my two day eric roberts neil sarah tim wow tim's donated 50 quid wow thanks tim oh look at this all right oh my god look at that three thousand and one okay it's going again oh my god we're gonna die oh that's quite fast oh no oh wow oh oh he's got he's cleaning his wheels now oh that you won't be a hair bit us it's quite noisy is that quite what contact being made ah that's what it's going to be doing let me get the normal camera yeah yeah yeah that's what we're waiting for that's what we're gonna go through we're just waiting for this step to get out of the way basically you spend your entire life waiting for fence to get out of the way doing the back end i guess oh it's moving back forwards now oh no he's going does it twice [music] [music] oh obviously we won't be able to film this from the outside but we have got um because we're not allowed outside um now should we keep this handheld on mount it can't build the handheld so you can show it control we're gonna have a couple of gopros on i'll record and yeah we'll get probably a montage of some descriptions at some point we are obviously doing the um there'll be a for it or someone did say we can can you put the gopher on the ground in front of the car well no because we can't get out of the car put it on the front of the ground i guess we could put it on the side you're not gonna see it but but no it's a wide angle lenses so we're in keithley there we go uh oh he's not far is he finishing now i don't know i'm actually feeling nerves it's went for a rollercoaster ride it is you know you can see the guys in front of you uh kind of going you know setting off and i'll go with me next hey so it's another rinse now and it's the wax uh i think he's gone for super whack oh did you think it has one of those big blowers to dry the car off as well well it does say super that's it do try yeah yeah wax in there let me show you what's going to get can't get that there we go i will just spin this round again one second we've got writing all over the car which is basically a dry wipe so it comes off easily so it's all going to be gone by the time we uh this must be the wax oh so now it's rubbing the wax off of it wax on wax off it goes on for quite a while doesn't it you get your money's worth i've paid eight pound fifty and not got this one with a lot of stuff there's 144 people there's more people watching this than they did watching the original stream for everybody that's watching we'll be doing an end of 24 hour stream uh it's about eight hours eight tonight when we're finishing at 10.9 officially uh just waiting for this guy to finish i just put the link in again to donate yes we are doing this to me to try and get people to donate just because we've hit three grand doesn't mean we stop that's a good point can you take an electric car into a jet into a wash well this is a fight out that way in a minute let me spin it round just watching this there's right so you'll put it on there yeah [music] at least but where how have we got time for a platinum wait it says bronze silver gold platinum what's brazilian i thought that's the most expensive one yeah something to do with the undercarriage oh sugar for that as well it's all for charity right so we're just waiting for this outlander bev so get out the way as usual hi that sounds actually really hot now it is yeah nice i might need that to dry out with it oh let's see if we can spin this round again oh it's a little there we go oh that i don't know if you can hear it that's the uh it's dragging him so this must be the uh flashing on one i guess it's getting blown yeah the mitsubishi driver is getting blown off right now and i guess it goes around the car no it's not brave it's stupid [laughter] i wish we had someone to uh who would come with us so they could have filmed on the outside put it on the big tv no it won't be any fun because it's the twizzy and it's perfectly sealed we won't get wet no it's going to be absolutely fine yeah that's it yeah stupid is doing a lot of insulation in the summer how waterproof are the dogs we'll find out from left uh well here we go but look these here they keep it tight but there are a few gaps spin see around let me show you guys so you can see the gaps there down there and i'll show you that back here there's a bit of a cap there that's not exactly uh you can't set the doors off a guy's still getting blown up it's a good one he's got his money's worth it definitely has i think these are the epitome of laziness we've got the machine polishes after oh god yeah something's really come out now here we are at morrisons no one's using it look at the price of fuel wow go on once it's done we're going in let's see what we're on yeah well let's have a look at the thing here three thousand five stops up to three grand come on you can do better than that it's for the little children and the hospital and the office rather oh it stopped it's resetting okay let's try and figure out how this works okay uh how to buy yowa select one of the available so we want number oh i want to open the door program oh hold up it's gone oh it's free it's free for us to go into number four number four selected he's got four there enter eight pound fifty come on is it not oh come on how does it need the card to work all right here can you hold that yep yep just picking one i don't know where would you put the cap on there uh moving up for that guy we're doing the start which he didn't seem to want to oh that's okay if you can turn the crap well do not confirm that card gaming there we go here come it right hang on well we have to move forward first that's up here as well only your camera's on i've got that one on you turn this one button on the up there yeah all right window closed

should we drive back around to see if it's got a big red space on it yeah nothing to see here nothing to see here [music] i want money back oh yeah i think we should look out and complain that's true good the thing is we can't go in that way we have to reverse back into it to start off again i think it's actually broken all right uh legit [music] chat [music] [laughter] the what writing oh look at this uh the rain's gone yep it didn't really clean it though did it the writing's gone but i thought it would be broken oh um we can't do anything else now right so what what type of consumer advice can we give to people don't go through a car washing this don't don't well clearly the car wash is lit um i've let holes down yeah i mean it's a car it's slowed on the motor it should be allowed in a jet in a jet yeah car wash and it did the whole thing there's it went of an issue at the start trying to figure out wait what's someone going to do if you've got a big spoiler on the back well um i don't know what to say this is the only one in the area is that right i think so unless there's one at the end of the bypass does anybody know if there's another automated car wash around to keep the area near the um well should we go to a hand car wash yeah let's do that did you hear just i mean look live streamer well yeah i guess we'll carry on that one and my battery's on 20 vents uh reconvene oh it's sit down right oh i did catch it only yeah yeah well we can ask some cash yeah all right uh let's do that one of the centers has freaked out someone said it's just it's just freaked but thing is we can't get out to have a go at the people in the uh in the garage to say look it's can you reset it for us oh it's definitely a bit wet in here right well um if anybody wants to use the ultimate couch and keep playing i won't bother coming to morrison's not today no no no no definitely not today two idiots have broken it we just saw him do it yeah it's still broken it's still there still not doing anything uh but surely there'd be alarm bells ringing inside morrison's garage shop thingy and they should be coming out to us we could be the guys getting paid seven quid an hour i don't think he cares oh there is ah there it is there's the car wash well um around well about half a mile up there there's a hand car wash uh i guess we could uh could try that but i don't know of any automated one near here yeah oh well well um i don't know well we'll go up today we'll people will be there in about two minutes guys and we'll try it because you know he's been hit for it if we didn't break it

and the van gaal in the yeah that's true this is my mechanics door we'll touch it all right just around this corner let's hope there's not a queue oh no oh red light how do you have it there you can just heat up the road well now the r8 with the red stripe that makes it really fast all right here's the carwash player hopefully they'll do contactless because i think i want to go at one pound 50.

Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK3WKwmReTmSFjf3mjWm4MJZ,QyvEXzww-28,flag yep we're 45 minutes away about 40 actually from uh until we can get out we could go to the toilet uh we can sit in cities we can lots of stuff bed bed [music] rather than a phone remember tv i thought i kind of do [music] music i mean you know just the modern life i'm always scared to leave i've gotten used to this small space i don't know what's going on here we don't want out there we could meet people yeah a charity i don't know wow if anyone was watching this obviously dude 3 116 316 pounds that's amazing absolutely that anonymous guy again known as yeah luka derek jones thank you very much guy with his registration not enough again some registration checking you out for uh mrt and in charlotte i think we're just tired now aren't we yeah i think we did it right starting at nine and well nine initially yeah we can leave into bath and bed yeah cause i thought a mirage falls we'll start in the morning and finish it but thank you imagine having to stay awake no of course 500 in the twizzy well it was flat the logistics just do not work out because it's a three-person job yeah yeah you need someone to follow you around basically and that's the problem we'd need to do it in ten days off work probably yeah at least a minimum of one week before work and then you've got the both weekend yeah yeah yeah we'd never we'd never make that in the videos ah brightness from the window where are you the sun oh it's just the the phone uh not very good at uh sorting it out you know it looks bright but it's not it's just focused on those not only yeah uh but he's funny but it's been i mean yeah it's been a fantastic day in terms of weather really really out so it's a good thing we've been spending it all in the inside environment of the renault tweezing look a greenhouse at some point yeah and a shower over nope let's have a look at a few yeah ask questions because we're too tired to talk talk too much uh right did you kill the phone no no the phone's waterproof um it's just that when the guy literally stuck his jet wash into the car and just pressed it i got a blister on my hand um because i went that to stop it and obviously you know a powerful jet washing there yeah especially a commercial one and i put the phone up there with the top of the roof to stop it getting soaked and i must have pressed the you know the green button or something that and for whatever reason people come back so it wasn't actually the water that caused them yeah yeah no idea some sort of bird um yeah it wasn't the water that caused the the malfunction as it were no the screen was fine on on my phone yeah i could see it yeah we could see a film there um so i still can't get over the fact with brook car wash no we didn't uh i thought it failed when we happened to be in it yeah so we didn't know what's good no just before it failed the car was going this yeah with the thing we were shaking from side to side you're a tornado experience we use dry white markers to write all over the side uh and you know of this so people wouldn't have to explain to everybody uh what we were doing so if someone look when we were driving past these here we're stuck in the hip 24 hours and it barely touched it pushed it yeah and then we were going it was a little you could just drive that yeah you could wipe it off with your hands that we've got some tissue you know we've taken bits off of it she went out and done that so yeah sorry that was uh that was a bit strange yeah right right uh oh they've got some insulation done that's really good yeah so now you'll have how would you charge for that i've got something that needs doing actually plenty of insulation to do in the in in the height of summer uh what's it to drive oh it's incredible it's good fun have you ever driven a lot of the lease nothing that [laughter] i don't know what to call it kitkat it's driving a kit car or a car that some of you mates made you can hear all the road noise it you feel everything through the steering wheel it's literally got no suspension no power seats uh rock solid the brakes are unassisted yeah unassisted brake no power steering so it's an old school cat he does feel kind of analog for electric isn't it yeah it's the most good analog electric car it gives you a good feel yeah and it is really good fun mainly because everybody i mean everybody apart from the occasional you know and the amount of people who go past and go wow oh there's something in the back yeah because when we took the the windows off obviously you could hear a lot of people yeah yeah oh wow and then the weather's back would move forward because he kind of tucked away yeah and then they got there's two people in there all the time that was after oh it's non-stop especially as you know when there's loads of people around and it's nice weather [music] um uh so uh that's good fun and i can't i can't recommend it enough to all the people uh here we go where are we well uh you did have them on subject with your tools well one uh so when you get as wet as well yeah i know my version of get as wet yeah different to his version of get as wet yeah wait what's funny whoops all right i just left one fair enough yeah where's the camera on this one oh there it is it's so wide angle oh yeah right uh me and my friend just rode past you on our scooters ah you waved me out actually yeah but yeah i think i know what you mean and just coming down yeah yeah you're going to kong could you remember yeah are you watching this world right yeah i hope you've got to where you're going you're not watching it when you're honest [laughter] i don't get caught yeah are you watching those little brook and that morrison's uh i have to point out just because every single person seems to do this twizzy is one zed yeah i thought i mean that's what twins it's the funny thing about it maybe the french pronounce it differently you're probably we're probably pronouncing it very wrong uh me and my friend oh yeah just right there uh lakeland florida again wow um hang on you made lancashire well i i i live very near the border of lancashire unfortunately yeah and one of the major downsides about where israel is yeah i mean basically within you can see the smoke from here within what five miles in three directions you can be in west yorkshire north yorkshire or lancashire yeah yeah pretty much in a triangle um how many miles per gallon are we getting about 24 25 miles an hour yeah i think [music] some people will genuinely ask about it so yeah you can't tell if it was joking i'll just leave it america say to his ee i don't know if there are any americans watching yeah there's someone from florida how would you pronounce t w i z y because they say z they said not to use them um we've got 30 minutes left how much she's going it's dry yeah i know i've been cleaned inside now a bit more now i reckon he's probably going to go in august but part of me thinks i don't know here we go we've got we've got here what's this what's it easy daring [music] dairy [music] this is what we've been that's why we always go somewhere really quiet this is all about the charity um then i think people still are i think it's got us a little bit gonna look a little bit the link is in the description below um yes ultimately about all that really yeah yeah about me if you want to know why we're doing it just on the link and it will open up just giving details on there so we did we have we've pretty much survived on sweets bacon cookies yeah cookies i had a pizza chili cocaine breeze oh yeah i've been in the future cherry cherries yep and uh i think that's why it really i think that's it oh mcdonald's oh you've been bitten [music] geez i think i can see here brother look up you're in the kitchen yeah hello look hello wait no the whip out the window [laughter] we're not coming down i'm just trying to say hello towards this snowmobile in the winter oh it's brilliant to drift it in snow again well i've if you look back about two and a half years uh in the where i i borrowed the tweeter and it was the uh beast from the east so proper snore then i did a few donuts in that one cause it's rear-wheel drive of course it's basically a sports car traction control would you call it mid engine probably no rear engine 911. so it's a 911 with lamborgh and um a renault sport tuned chassis two-seater yeah yeah hyper car or supercar you know what it's a supercar crossover they have everything in it and the fact that they're still selling the exact same thing eight years later just means how good it is yeah it's pretty perfection i've sold it i got it right first time so just keep doing the same thing i ain't broke do not fix it switch gear from a clio and a bit of other things i think this one's in a van it does look very french the steering wheel looks it's straight out of a van yeah hard weary yeah and the handbrake's a bit special in it yeah because the trouble is though you have to pull it up to release it but sometimes you keep pulling it up and looking up enough yeah sometimes you take a cap anymore because it's right it's at the maximum uppage uh so yeah it's oh yeah mclaren center center right yeah yeah mclaren as well is there anything it's just what ferrari-ness has it got four-wheeled it's got four wheels throughout the ground there we go the color the color's a mclaren orange as well what was the orange i'll get more lamborghini nothing to do with gt porsche gt an orange oh an apostrophe with silver the gt is the old-school one with no it's a v10 in it with the racing engine i know what's this color what the jeep renegade fez it is there we go everyone that supercar uh right so let's see if we've got a few of the uh just send us messages because we've got another 25 minutes and we're very very tired uh so answering answering questions will be really good how much are you selling your twitter go for well whatever the market rate is about seven that's probably at the moment at the moment it is yeah but who knows who knows uh and i believe i've added my own windows with it what else did the pub make apart from korean pizza have a look on their website yeah how would how was alcohol really good food really nice people up there and how old is the pub sixteen hundreds yeah it's very old about sixteen hundred we're talking you know before america pub is not a joke no that pub was built before america was even founded by or even found yeah america did exist the continent yeah um before colombo found it yeah colombo yeah yeah well there's one mark but it wasn't those pesky kids right let's go let's look at some more questions aluminium yep aluminum yeah aluminum aluminum elements you're literally missing out a part of the word illumination nothing's underneath aluminium pavement sidewalk it has to be explained yeah pavement into mobile bbq it more or less was earlier it was that one it was i don't want to keep firing here we have thought about putting a plank of wood across here and developing a table you're getting a bath yeah that would be brilliant you just put it across there just put your paint on it fantastic no i think i'll leave the weber for the bbq sensor driving position we've done that ferrari temperamentalness oh it's got no temperamentalness rocks solid and yeah um probably got as many handling of the ferrari we've got more looks than javelina he would do he would he's the other ferrari and this was it reminds me of a bugatti yeah i think so yeah i would think that that would be the performance side yeah i think so yeah cheer on oh yeah at least i gta 6 and for orange do you need a driver's license yes and you need to drive your life to be on the road to be on the road um apart from well you need a provisional license for just a scooter is that right you need to do some sort of test you have to pass by taking scooters i believe you can get a lower powered version of this though and drive that on a provisional here in this country yeah even after brexit yeah yeah yeah it's lower powered and it's power that dictates what scooter you get isn't it ah so it'll be limited to 30 mile an hour i guess hence the ammo i bet you can chip it it's probably hence the ammo yeah yeah it's limited to 28 in it um so yeah you do need your hands how about this for a question if you could combine the paths from every eb on the market today to make the ultimate eevee which would be would you have which is just a tight cow a thai can with tesla batteries yeah oh no a tycoon tesla supercharges thai car with the supercharger network the tycoon is by far well for me to buy the best the model 3 is a really good car i really do it but if someone took the supercharger network away from tesla it would then just become a coward yeah yeah very good one but it's his trump card isn't it that's it yeah it always comes back 100 i mean that is why i got it and we'll probably won't let so many people get them yeah if you gain the miles it's really not that well what can people worry about it's not range anxiety is it charging yeah yeah is it working it'll get better but for now that's the massive advantage uh how far did you drive honestly don't know i reckon we're done the 850 maybe it's after saying it really because we're doing lots of shots a lot of it's just been going around the town or around up and down hours yeah more twizy admirers there uh let's be honest all these real you know people stood outside that nightclub uh all the girls were clearly underage which is why they stood outside tonight [music] [laughter] what about trump john porridge trump orange lauren's love yeah it's not quite old enough and it makes sense um just caught you two just caught you guys we'll catch up with you two getting wet and bubbly later donation done oh thank you very much and bond everybody on your has such cool names you have to have a kid and call it here yeah yeah brexit doesn't matter because they haven't changed any of the rules since christmas well maybe if you to do this again what car would you do eating van's not allowed mod less [laughter] trouble the car is so comfortable and you can fully stretch out in it yeah it would be a challenge though would it yeah there's not a challenge there um so supposedly for me if you have me that will be here maybe that will come back to 2016. you've got more space there though when it's very square seats side by side it's got a heater a heater which effectively has the power of deadbolt breaths but it's basically uh a hair dryer isn't it it's a a 5.99 hairdryer in it or one of those usb fans yeah but it's practice only purposes windscreen yeah it's not the heat of a cabinet but it must give you a little bit here yes uh i had a 50cc and i was 60. my brother had a thompson moped oh well he got stolen and then he got someone else but you could always tell if he was working and you can always tell when he was coming up per broadlands it's not because you could hear it yeah you could hear telling you coming home i sort of take on this gun thought of all plays oh that's his middle name is james far brilliant i used to know someone called oliver james bond did you yeah he wasn't very james bonded though no so yeah i'm going to say some ladies man but he could be three uh so it will be a lady if you've got your name james bond they're not going to mention his actual name was it or is it hold it go the other way the whole thing is after the last don't know it took a tail reservation yeah are you coming with your wife i'm sure you are mr mrs smith can you have that oh no yeah yeah yeah yeah honest [laughter] you were with someone who's certainly with smith and mr reese smith would to [ __ ] in the hotel okay yeah no no no yeah uh right uh your questions up the questions i heard it had the power of the hand dryer in the dents down the green dragon it probably does what we up to i'm just gonna pay i'm gonna pay the um everybody yeah yep the donation link uh 3146 pounds should we try and aim for something by how long we've got we've got 17 minutes 17 minutes 17 minutes then we can no we're not cushioned we're on pillows pillows uh that people put on the sofa and then you have to remove them and put them on the front of the bed people people put the cushions on the bed don't they take them off after they've made the bed yep and then when they get in bed to throw them on the floor yep get in bed and then you got to make the bed before you can put the cushions off the floor and put them so this is actually pointless pointless yeah it's that and we make waste money on stuff at least the tweezy will not lose value cushioning just a waste of money yeah and how many environments yeah it is oh i'm sorry oh god is that going to blow the air back [laughter] i have been to the toilet for 24 hours uh i can tell even this guy's been that bad for me you shouldn't smell your own but i can't on that one oh my eyes are watering you're you know you're right the water except my cause of

is drying tired as well yep my wife won't let me buy a twizzy well advice there uh is with any of your situation is buy it and then just beg for forgiveness it's easy to ask for forgiveness and permission yep um because once she gets in it that's it and she's not going to be scared of you going out and pulling other women in it that's not going to happen exactly i mean why wouldn't you that's all you have to ask her yeah why shouldn't i buy a tweety yeah yeah you can live in it you can yeah we've proven that yeah you can do that and it brings smile to people's things it pretty much doesn't depreciate no no you might as well have your money sat on the driveway rather than the bank account yep you can get a tuning box and it does increase the speed and be not to 30 considerably as well you could go at 60 i think 65 indicated it's slightly off i gps it and you're about two miles an hour off at 30. too tall to fit in the twizy the seat do the how tall are you going back yeah just back up is this live yes if you don't forget the things you've done not what you haven't done so just buy one yeah yeah i i don't understand centimeters seven centimeters but shortly i've got shots

ears [laughter] um right uh some more people done it dave strait the uh guy with the pond star name nice ears uh alberto d oliveria andrade i think who donated he says have a great poop have a poop on me can you come in something else someone wants us to do another 24 hours but now i guess sir 48 hours i think we'd have to have a bit of a break first and with everything we've eaten i think i don't think it's possible [music] on the skits of local news they're looking for two car wash vandals in a small orange car it was in keithley so you're gonna have to work on that one there's no evidence of proof nor live stream on the on youtube i know people who work for your social place i can see there's a sweet thief oh someone's taking the sweets out of the twizzy uh circumstantial opening happy new year i think it's time for the beer or two crispy old man exit yeah creepy old one i think it's creaky creepy wrong one small step for an orthopedic shoe guy that's not enough feeling shoes it's quality yeah they're in very trouble reach holiday reeboks straight in the bath i think that's a good call i think there'll be some sort of scum line i'm james i live next to thomas that's nice oh james who's thomas oh that's it yeah that gym is that your boyfriend it's for you i want to work with him i definitely want to win he was on he was walking on the street he's the one with the dog 3 246 wow uh well done well done ladies next 24 hours yes you saw what we were without an hour in the supermarket there's no chance we're going to be doing 24 hours i have to live with this all the time as well this is not for sure tell her not to eat the chocolate raisins i think that's what you say right so is there anything else you've got two minutes guys to ask your stuff because we want to get in the bathroom um we want to get in the bag we wanted that wasn't bad it means getting a bath yeah it means getting the bath so let's uh thank of course the wonderful start of the show she's done a lot of work these past 24 hours a lot of driving um so yes and i have to say this thing here the twizzy has killed the car wash there you go yeah twizzy [laughter] [music] and there we are there we go oh sorry that's all yeah the home from home that's that was the original uh configuration because they're not they're not the comfiest long-term seats are they um oh no oh god from home we were in that one and that one how did you sleep in that quite frankly i'm not sure i think just exactly look at that i think we went from doing a full week's work then getting in that straight getting this with no arrest [music] i went home had my tea and i sat on the bed and i was that far away from going to sleep yeah and then you came can't even do 25 we did the livestream and then 24 hours and here we are again yeah so anymore before we yeah we went shopping so it's it's full of tweezing i'm not sure it needs it too bad too oh yeah i might plug it in a bit i wait till it's a sunny day and then the sun can uh charge the tweezer uh right how can we top that i don't know well you guys decide give us some challenges give us some ideas i guess i still think close to cost maybe finish whitby maybe set living sentence to whitby yeah i mean i did think of uh taking the twizy to the highest and then you know altitude the highest pub in the uk yeah from here so driving straight to highest pub and getting through it and then stay in there to get you still could do that because the twizy can do pretty much anything you want uh so yeah i think that's an option but yeah before uh electric scooter we did think i had electric scooter around north coast 500 but we can't do that for legal reasons you're not allowed to ride them on the road no unless it's rented we'll say bye guys we're heading off now we're you're going are you oh yeah we're off now in the twinsies i've been waiting for you are you going to use your only fans uh page for when you did it yeah i told you about that one yourself forever right well i'm assuming there are no more questions um and thanks again for everyone who's going to we've got a few uh from a danish city el from 1988 and to another 24 hours i don't think we could do a lot of things we can do in three or four days yeah because we have we have jobs yeah we cannot take three four weeks off to drive anybody just it'd be the lots of the same thing yeah but you don't want to see it's just driving up and down an area or deal it's boring or even uh tt course patient ain't far from us i o m t t i them on t t cost yes well i think uh yeah on the open days you can just you can freely just drive around will it go around about 30 miles around yeah do that won't worry yeah i'll take it a bit easy probably uh great work 37 miles yeah 37 miles all right there you go um because an electric motorbike can see which one wins [laughter] if we're giving a 10-minute head start i don't think we would do it public roads yeah on ireland i suppose the trouble is she's getting it there yeah this is the trouble isn't unless you've got a trailer and something you can when you've got it yeah you've got a three and a half hour recharge so to do 80 90 miles we'll take you yeah yeah four five hours which means you've got a range of about 180 miles yeah is it a day it's too timing just to get it there's me right should we should we come off now uh thank you very much last time yes thank you for everyone's donated yeah if you haven't or you want to uh still donate then the just giving link of course will be valid for some time i imagine yeah yeah so if you're watching this in go do something useful uh uh so yeah brilliant this has been great i think we've come close to two thousand pounds are they done so yeah which is absolutely amazing blow the way back we've gone really way above the uh what yeah what was the thought we might achieve even under being up to what we might yeah the best optimistic uh sort of projections really yeah good enough as we actually [ __ ] what am i getting from that right well we'll sign off uh there are no more questions we're pretty much going enjoy your back poo no no no no not doing it in the bath that's gonna be just messy it's a time saver though because it's just trying to plug afterwards here but then yeah [laughter] uh right before we get into really much stuff yeah um thank you very much yes thanks for watching donating keeping us amused all that sort of stuff and the will be quite many weeks away um who knows where um so yeah thanks for watching guys i'm going to press the cross button now and press end,-1
Electric Vehicle Man,PLjc2gh_1SxK3WKwmReTmSFjf3mjWm4MJZ,ROb4VnnnEtk,i've forgotten to press a button but yes i'm live i'm such a professional as always right okay guys um welcome that's how i wanted to start this live stream i was staring at a screen that you couldn't see uh anyway let's get on with this first things first though i have my usual this one is the crystal head onyx for those that we're asking and they always this noise and we're gonna try and not drink to the same level that i did on uh well in the first year where i basically well let's say i woke up at three or four in the morning uh to make myself feel better i'm gonna try and be a little more sensible on that one so let's have the first oh here we go yeah first little shot and then we'll get to the questions cheers to 2023 i guess hopefully it'll be better than the previous year in the previous year after that one oh it's been a while since i've had one that's uh powerful stuff also got plenty of these as you can oh as you can tell i've just realized i ain't got a bottle opener i assume everyone can hear me and see me by the way i'm hoping that goes without saying um right so i'll start off with the questions from the uh kind of announcement because they were first there's only a few and then we'll get to the live chat one uh first though i'm going to send a message to my daughter to bring me a bottle opener because as always full professional bottle opener i can't spell there we go right i'll have that in a minute you've got a good old traditional mug beer right uh let's start oh thank you mr donald parish for a donation he's from oh nebraska i always to know where people are in fact if you're from anywhere outside of the uk in fact forget that if you're from anywhere let me know where you are i always i'm always really fascinated that people watching different countries around the uk and so forth uh right let's start with this one tesla model threes can now be picked up for oh forgot again somebody did donate so uh it's only fair [music] oh it smells turps i'm going to ease off on this by the way and then i think i might put some orange or coke with them what are you having let me know thank you mr donation all right but i don't it why am i doing things that i don't for me it's being it doesn't taste nice until the third or fourth one of it doesn't seemed really nice uh okay right quickly lincoln nottingham denmark uh boston massachusetts um bishop stortford bradford of course uh well brilliant uh i'll keep an anna and get back to this question i'm completely unorganized as he clearly can tell so let's start with some questions that's what we're here for and then as the night goes on we'll steadily get a bit more mary i suppose tesla model 3 is going to be picked up for less than 30 000 pounds they can't used of course and that will probably drop a bit morrow's x company car start to appear so three four-year-old model 3 with 60 000 miles or an mg for long range uh well i did have a look last week there was a model 3 with 60 000 miles funnily enough 2019 and that was a 28 and a half thousand pounds so uh i think i think that's that's getting to the realm of reasonable on the used front 28 in a bit for uh let's visit a car that does well over to well i'll just say over 200 miles in the real world we've got over 300 bear horsepower decent tech so far so far eight year hundred thousand mile warranty on the battery and drivetrain um i would oh if i'm doing lots of long journeys i'll go for the model three if you're just using it as a car and occasional long journeys i go for the mg4 because it's new but that's a tough one it's this is something we have to drive them both and then just see which is best for you which you prefer it's nice to have a choice really uh happy new year how i have a question if you don't mind we have on order a 4.8 kilowatt solar system with give energy inverter and 9.5 kilowatt battery our usage is 5 000 kilowatt hours a year but we have just had aircon installed very bosch and that has pushed up our electric consumption from 14 to 21 kilow hours in the winter i assume that does the heating we are currently on a very good fix until the end of august would you recommend getting a second battery we obviously wouldn't see any benefit until the end of our fix and we can move to the niko 7. so we get eco7 and that's from steve uh go on the octopus go target the uh what's it called gold cozy octopus cozy it's for heat pumps so not batteries so forget that not to make sense was it i'm guessing you don't have an ev which is why you're not on that one uh you know what if you can afford it i will go for the second battery because i'm convinced in the next several months 2023 there will be a heat uh sorry a home battery tariff someone has to do we've got one for heat pumps we've got one for evs there must be for batteries at some point uh have you looked at any wind turbines for your house uh any that look okay not going to annoy the neighbors uh yes essentially the planning stops that excuse me uh where's that bottle opener the planning stops that because as far as i've read it you need to have a detached house to um you have to have a detached house excuse me to get a wind turbine or if it's cited on land it has to be something 20 meters or something ridiculous perhaps someone can let me know in the comments um from your neighbor so essentially anyone with the semi-detached it's impossible you can you simply can't get one but with a wind turbine unless it's a massive one that does a kilowatt when it's running full pelt it doesn't make financial sense you've got to go big um or it's just not worth it with with that so unless you've got a farm lots of land i i wouldn't even look at wind because it's just not possible um now i'm going to have to send a message to my wife with a bottle opener ah what what's going on here this is what it's doing a you know i've never never all there i'm going to do some live stuff because i'm getting behind i can come back to these in a minute uh where we go there we go where we go wow it's been a lot there's been a lot right boston bradford glasgow uk sally baba i remember you from last time uh is it one glass per donation it was last time and i got apple apocalyptically drunk and that would mean i'd be on the floor far too soon so drink yes shot no um i think uh maybe one of these but yeah i'm not i'm not talking for donations because that's what happened last time i said oh if you've done it i'll give you a drink and then i overestimate underestimated what the youtube was and uh couldn't keep up quite frankly but it's only fair i have to do something uh or orange and vodka what do you think which one which one do i get a bottle up enough to go get me onto uh skellman thorpe i'm not sure where that isomer in the uk milner uh hi ian wishing you all well looking forward to this evening ian who's ian i'm not ian i do get some strange names my name's andrew not ian uh hi from cornwall harrogate uh uh welts border with only evse for our 24 kilo hour leaf and fifth well it works for you it works hello from lead lots from lots of york shots good to see plymouth torquay carling and crompton oaks cider mr martin's drinking uh brazil milton keynes island southampton oh and dora i'm here on a ski holiday very very lucky uh crumpton from scotland uh oh every time it scrolls off i miss where i am here we go how much is your insurance for my model 3 weirdly last uh when is it i think it's it's middle of year anyway when it renews it went down quite a bit i think i know they've changed the insurance rules now haven't they've um they've got to uh i'm just saying yes i do still need a bottle opener the the cat gives you a preference to if you're a new customer or an existing one so it was about 600 pounds for the model 3 and it's now about 400 pounds that's for me obviously my wife uh and harry not that it made any difference for that um but i'm in the 40s now so i don't really matter what i drive it seems to be the same price no matter what i mean the the tt which granted barely does any mile sits in the garage i think that's about 180 quid for you mini 200 no about 300 quid or something that can it depends where you live and who you are more than the car i find uh yeah i have a bd postcode so that never helped uh where was i oh here we go thank you bottle opener ah i'm gonna ask you for that for five minutes say hello i would you were busy doing what things things right well thank you okay this is this the one from the cracker yeah oh you could have got me this one thank you very much there we go i will see you soon hi they may be joining us later on i'm gonna get mitten on merry let me just pour this while i read more so you need to drive anywhere from car one we need to recharge exeter then two or three times before we arrived anyway as opposed to an easy 400 miles in an ice car yes it is less convenient doing a long journey in a full electric car and at the moment not really that much cheaper or any cheaper depending on the petrol diesel car that you're driving oh it's got a bit of head on it oh can you wear that bubble that's nice uh i'll finish that off in a second uh we are on bulb can't wait for the transfer i'm guessing you need to octopus absolutely get batteries in charge at the cheap rate yes but you need to be on a tariff and to get the right tariffs at the moment you need an ev uh in bradford drinking tea what's the tea got in it whiskey maybe new year how are your extremities not blue and ice on your nose with your useless heat pump it is true it is true we do have a heat pump that is utterly useless and won't heat the house up at all um in fact let me show you the app that's what it's saying at the present uh come on focus focus camera oh you won't focus that's useless and that's useless it is because there's 19.8 right now and that's in the hall where the thermostat is eight and a half degrees outside it is raining i don't know if you can hear the picture pattern on the windows nothing i can do about that i'm afraid and so yeah any questions uh about heat pump cars youtube anything at all just ask uh uh where we go it's a good thing that your missus is in the emergency services you'll need it for when you're paralytic by 10 10 o'clock ah last longer than that hang on let me just top up the beer well that's quite a really powered that badly look at that that is awful it's an ice cream back to the drink hmm excuse me right less drinking while talking hi from swansea nottingham north yorkshire good man uh selby here an ionic and a v8 jag so precision gunner uk he's tight with money open bottle with teeth [music] uh well listed i have pretty many buildings so i need to woo the conservation officer to get our type 2 chargers can have you got a garage can you go in that i don't have to go outside but yeah listed buildings that could be a problem um was the reduction duty uh due to you being older now the insurance no no no it's uh i don't think it goes down between 41.42 um obviously my wife's still 25 so you know that could put it up a bit but no i think it was just that that rule change that they can give a discount or preferential discount to new customers so it has been always cheaper for us uh for the last few years anyway to to renew weirdly uh hi from otley not far from me with practice you can open bottles with folded paper well um i i just end up cutting myself if i ended up doing that looking forward to the new hyundai corner yes there is a new one uh i'll have to email hunt sorry hyundai about that one they've come out and said that we're all saying it wrong it's hyundai not hyundai excuse me but i'm very sorry about that it started it started let me go to a few more questions i'm going to try and keep up with the live stream so if i haven't mentioned this question ask it again in in five minutes or so picky parton can't stop burping i just had a big tea about an hour and a half ago on some trifle so that's not helped what ev if any would you recommend as a first car both used and new i mean i assume you mean for a young you know newly passed the driving test person uh 500e uh relatively cheap and you know to buy one and ev prices anyway uh yeah 5500e honda e if you've got a lot of money rentals always probably the best because they've been out for ages and there's lots of cheap ones around uh if you're traveling a lot in the uk and do european trips would you rely on independent charging networks or would you play safe and buy a tesla ooh well teslas make it phenomenally easy i mean you just put the destination in the sat nav and it tells you where to charge and it just works you know the worst case scenario is your q a bit ultimately it does just work but there's been lots of people that do uh european journeys in you know in other cars using the normal uh network and and they've managed it as well well if if the car that you're buying i guess cost the same as a test that i would probably go to the tesla if you're doing lots of journeys because the supercharger network is still the unique selling point that keeps me in that car i'll be doing a about it in the next few weeks or so um because we've made the decision of whether we're keeping it or not hmm happy new year to everybody from australia strove oh that's terrible how much per shot of school vodka for you would miss his evm i'm assuming you mean donation actually oh she won't have any of that when you drive bmw i4 when they give me one and as it's bmw that will be never they occasionally do uh events that they invite people to but uh they're notoriously difficult to get hold of especially when you're running a small youtuber so if i could get older one i would i get this quite a lot why haven't you reviewed this or can you re can you review whatever it's not a case if we just ring up and say can you give me this usually i send an email or saying hi can i have this and they go oh okay then three months later you'll get it or we don't have any at the moment or you i would say about 30 of the time i just don't get a reply uh so yeah it uh it's not just a call up and get get a castle i think it can be a pain in the neck especially for the big macs audi and bmw i'm exactly brilliant hmm when will ev suvs be replaced by saloons hatchbacks uh slash aspects should i say as a more popular ev uh yeah they are all suvs out there i mean that's for a very good reason from the manufacturer's point of view one suvs are what people want to buy two you can put the batteries underneath the floor raise the car and lose no interior space so it solves that problem um i don't know i mean you know the public are buying suvs it's the public that need to change what they want you know you've gone from a nissan micra to a qashqai because people prefer to be higher up or something um i i don't particularly suvs or well they're not really suvs anymore rather there used to be sports utility vehicles and now they're just look it they don't actually do anything suvs oh here we go again excuse me we won't need another car until 2025 6. what do you think will be good second-hand electric car to get to give an idea we are looking at a something mg for it so i imagine you're saying if in two or three years time you'll need a car that will be used so i guess it's what's been sold now in the last year or so right um mg4 of course or the other mgs for value they can't be argued with depends depends on your budget predominantly i mean that's the first thing i need if you're looking in the mg4 sort of price bracket not much around in ev world i'm afraid that's kind of family sized very very highly rate that one as a family cars and all rounder it's brilliant um but i kind of need your budget unfortunately um can you do another update on your car i assume you mean the model three well it's three years old in april so i guess that would be a good time uh right let me get back to the live stream uh questions and then i'll go back to this one oh god i'm going to be behind in the questions i'm i'm lots of scrolling to do so bear with me bear with me uh this guy's in stockport uh which is nice uh i lived in bd postcode insurance dropped by half moving it would do bd postcards aren't cheap hmm excuse me hello even man look at my new heat pump three weeks in it's amazing how many people have heat pumps um i'm getting installed during winter i guess it makes you know i don't think it's cheaper but a lot of people that have said things that i've just got one it's always been in winter other than something you think people get a heating system but when it's not cold but needs must i suppose but yeah heat pump is just another heating system i think that's the first thing that people need to get used to it just works in the same way gas spider does it i pressed the temperature on the thermostat and it gives me the temperature as long as it's size properly as long as you get the heat calculations done you'll be fine it will be fine costings different get the fish different question uh oh alice ah yes i am amazing i wonder which alice that could be say hello alice do you know if ev battery will degrade if carries packed for a few months in negative degrees it's certainly won't do any favors when teslas are left and it does vary between manufacturers they recommended to be kept plugged in not to 100 to you know it's between 60 and 80. when it's left anyway um i guess it depends on if your car has thermal management on the battery if it does it'll probably be fine but anything that's not used certainly battery wise tends to not do any favor that they to be used at least a little bit um a car if you don't use a car for a few months you don't do any favors really it kind of you know you need to use stuff to keep them i don't know what the technical phrasing battery terms will be but you need to at least use it every now and then now obviously a thermal battery management will deplete the battery steadily so that will use it and then if it's plugged in or if you're on a smart charge you could do it remotely give it a little top up every now and then so the various ways of doing it um but yes anything left tends to not go well for anything not just batteries so the cues at gretna on bbc breakfast this morning three hour wait have you ever had to wait for the charge i assume you mean teslas because that's what's been in the news um i think maybe once for 10 minutes i mean it's it's the christmas period that's the exception here and obviously some of the networks have been opened up sorry the tesla superchargers have been opened up to other cars which has made them busier but uh typically not i think in the two and a half years i've had it maybe once and that was for five minutes so i found it quite rare but there are more and more tesla's been sold every day and although they are increasing charges it's gonna get to the point where the more cows same amount of charges you're gonna get cues fortunately but the cues for them are nowhere near the queues for the uh the public network we've got two charges and one might not be working you only see two or three charge uh sort of queuing at one of the let's say grid serve for example because if someone turns up and sees three cows queuing for one charger they just typically go uh whereas the tesla people tend to queue because they know that there's a high turnover when you've got a dozen people using it and moving out how is a public fast charging infrastructure in the uk progressing lots of complaints here in the us recently i'm assuming you say fast you mean what we'd call rapid charges the the you know the 50 to 300 kilowatt charges uh it's getting better but i found that the amount of cows sold are outstripping the amount of charges being installed so although the charging network is bigger than it's ever been there are way more cars trying to use it so that's not helping it really isn't i mean i would say now for me personally and i'd be interested to let me know in the comments what you think is it for those that have had an ev for long enough anyway i would say it's easier to get it or it was easier to get a charge three four five years ago or even eight years ago a rapid charger than it is today because even though there were less charges there were far fewer cars using them and a lot of the cars were shot to range and didn't really travel so yeah it's um i don't want to use the word it's getting worse is the charging network but it's certainly under strange should we say maybe that's another that i should do whatever is there any chance you could put your mic nearer your mouth do people need me to do that can you hear me can you hear me i can turn me up a little bit on the volume levels how was that then hello hello i can't this this will go in there further forward unfortunately i mean it's just here so it's it's less than a foot away from her mouth it should be okay but let me know if it's too quiet um classic ionic corner 64 and currently pole star 2 what next oh oh what would you go for next hmm well i assume you've not got a tesla up to now because you don't want one um oh there's a lot coming out you know what that's that's a tough one no point you're saying something a nero because you've had the corner pole star 2 is good but quite inefficient and i kept on banging my knee on the center console oh you know i'll have to come back to that one remind me because i'll probably forget i don't know corner ionic pole star 2 what would you get next what would you point uh i have a heat pump uh diking 16 kilowatt wow that's a big heat pump mine's five hope this is recorded i have to and pretend i have to watch the glass onion oh the film i think it does look quite good but yes it will be recorded uh at least i yes youtube does keep it on i guess i'll put it up for everyone to watch in the future if they want uh great when does the fun start what fun do you want what fun do we want to start you know you're the one's asking me questions uh i'm gonna be an extra scrolled all the way to the bottom i need to keep going oh wow there's so many questions that i got to i'm getting there i promise i'm promised getting there and there is a delay as well from me saying something and you you hearing it what's the app for your heat pumpers mine's the same but no one said um my app is the valent app uh i had to get a a separate uh wi-fi controller i guess you call it uh installed on the development system otherwise you can't use the app so that's the only way you're going to get the app i'm afraid if it's got that built in can't remember it's called the uh just put veilden um wi-fi app it'll come up on as a piece of hardware but it's about 130 quid it's not cheap uh did you get your heat pump from octopus no i didn't uh it was before they started doing any of that uh what's the uh oh i've done that one glass onion was bad now well i want uh and what walks that one then he's got good reviews though it's not a top gun too i imagine still need to rewatch that there we go um sound could do with a boost someone else uh in fact let me scroll down to see if anything if this sounds okay levels of fine levels if i believe right i'm going back up again this again awfully complicated terrible when it comes to recorded videos a little online ones being a producer for your own thing i mean this is what i can see i hope i can take this off without unplugging anything uh no no it's uh all right so that's the camera i can't pull it any further that's the text that's the analytics that's the keyboard that's the light see this yeah that i can't pull the camera that didn't work at all i can't pull the camera any further back but essentially you're producing your own system and it it's it takes a bit of getting used to which is why hopefully once uh start doing the regular monthly live streams won't be as long or as drinky as this uh for members only um i'll be a bit more practice at it hmm the recent cold weather was too much for even my conventional gas boiler heating to maintain temperature hmm so i think more insulation is my next scheme yeah thing is i always get told that you need a high credentialated house or a heat pump you don't you absolutely don't what you need is a hyper integrated out for any heating system because then you'll lose less energy a heat pump will heat the house even if it's leaky but it will be running at a temperature that's too high for it to be really efficient so it will work but it'll be less efficient and the the efficiency extremes are far bigger with a heat pump than a gas piper the gas boiler tends to run at a a small bracket you know 10 either side sort of thing whereas a heat pump you could go from let's say for 500 to 300 just by whacking up the temperature to a ridiculous amount so i think that's why people always assume you need to insulate houses because it makes sense to have one so it will heat the house but ultimately you don't need it but that goes for any heating system insulation first then worry about the you know what whatever generates the heat or moves heat around um so yeah we're pretty much as as good as the house is going to get without going silly so um that was the next step but we needed a new uh heating system anyway because the gas boiler was on its way out a bit sooner than uh than we expected mhm where am i our asos heat pump is three years service on our detached listed fat house you will document how ruby chevrolet was my roommate my installer he was he was all right i was fine i had no problem with that i mean there's a few legals but uh ultimately yeah it is now running i won't say perfectly because there's always tweaks there was one setting that changed which i didn't know about and i i shall point out that i told my installer to leave it as default i wanted to fiddle so i could learn the system um and i changed that i think was a 18th of december it was a hot water setting i can't remember what it was called anyway um that probably adds a 20 30 efficiency difference just by changing that setting that setting so it's a it's a continuing thing i need winter to you know well i needed winter to be here to know how it behaved and then to tweak the settings and now i'm gonna have to wait until it gets really cold again before i could test the settings and so forth and so forth so it's an ongoing uh thing with it with a heat bumper finders it's good for tweakers if you're a tweaker what's your thoughts on the new rebranded q8 e-tron what a massive audi electric car to be honest i've never been a fan of audi suvs it's somebody's photocopied the same car and just press the increase size button exceptionally well made good cars they're just ball into me but if somebody give me one or it was a lease scheme i know the nhs um they used to do of may still do lots of audis on their kind of company car scheme thingy lee scheme i wouldn't say no to everyone absolutely not but i just find them i don't know i look at one and picture it being packed on the zigzag lines outside the school it just there's no passion there if you know what i mean and how do you good at making passionate cars uh right oh oh mr parish 99 cents uh oh and i think that's only a beer one i don't i'm not gonna go for a shot for me not not because the donation was too low it isn't i i appreciate any donation i promise you but i've got to i've got i've got a lot of hours to get through here hmm starting to get nice you know what i need nibbles alice oh my lovely wife if you're watching this i think there's a tub of heroes in the garage let's see what happens see if that works otherwise i'll have to send another text message can new customers get octopus go parents installing solar and give energy battery in march anyone can get octopus gore but you need an electric car you always have done it's just now they're tightening up on it i'll level about a year ago anyway uh so if they have an ev or a plug-in hybrid yes um otherwise no but again hopefully a new tariff will come out at some point um so all you need is the battery uh donegal island again for anybody new that's just joined us where are you in the world i always to know that do you miss your leaf days i have a 2012 since 2017. 55 battery now oh you i got you you bought 2012 leaf in 2017. uh 55 battery so that'll be doing oh 40 odd 45 miles maybe i mean let's face it for a a car that just goes from the shops and back it's gonna be fine but it's not an only car i suppose do i miss the leaf days uh not really i mean i never i never loved the car it was the first electric car it led to this thing the so there's always that and it never let us down really nissan excuse me dealers weren't the best should we say but the car was pretty much faultless it's just it was just a car there was no again there's no passion there that's why i to have a you know the one in the garage and that just for a bit of fun so do i miss it no because now i can just do longer journeys and used to supercharger network i've been spoiled by that by the tesla supercharger network it really is night and day plus events on which furniture will be standing at the end of the night well compared to that night that you're referring to where we've got a lot a lot more distance between me and the furniture behind so i think i'll be all right they will probably be joining me at some point in the night as well um in fact you can just see lots of beer there the uh fated no longer sold evm evk mugs as well um the award at the top uh so yes yeah ikea of course half our house is for monkey uh if excuse me if i remember your pcp on your tesla's due in a year or so would you get another one keep the car or change it uh well we have since paid the pcp off so there is no more finance on the car so we can do what we want essentially that's that's basically i spent the last two and a half years doing saving up to pay the thing off so um i'll be doing a about that in the next few weeks so i don't want to spoil it too much but essentially we're getting a new car but also probably keeping the tesla for things i've already said the supercharger network in fact i might as well just say it now because still plenty of people to watch it every time i do a long journey in the tesla anyway because we do long journeys in press cards as well i always say the same thing to myself in fact the last time it happened that made the decision for us when i thought about changing it with the i did in august uh it was the aura cat going to birmingham and then i was driving down pulled in at the services near birmingham to get something to eat mainly but i thought well might as well charge so i just plugged in there was only i think two being used including me of of 12 chargers i walked across to get something to eat and there were two grid surf chargers one of them wasn't working oh i assume so because there was no one part there and the other one was working and there were two other cats or three cars in total waiting to use the single charger and again i do this every time but it that that kind of hit home again to me i said that is exactly why i need to keep the tesla until they open up the net the whole of the network to everybody or the public charging network gets a lot better you know the the long journeys that i do it's going to be noticeable so if i got let's say the genesis gv60 which is the car i would have tomorrow if i had the money um it's a brilliant car and i probably prefer the car but then i do a long journey in fact when we go to scotland you've got one working wrapping charger if you're lucky two of the other ones at fort william i assume still haven't been commissioned and then i think eight or a dozen superchargers tesla superchargers there and it it spoils trips it spoils journeys and if you're doing one for for the if i'm going to an event where you have to be there whether you know you have to be an hour on time it can it can get in the way sometimes if you don't plan ahead and i've got used to not planning ahead but the public charging network is getting as i said steadily harder to use so we're keeping the tesla because there's nothing wrong with it b it's a great car it's quick it's now 48 and a half thousand pounds for the same card again i paid just over 40 for it so i won't be getting another one it's too expensive now but we are keeping that for the foreseeable future and maybe changing the other two for you know a single something or another um my model ice 366 fully comp protected uh yeah i think the trouble is a lot of people think uh electric cars are expensive to insure but i find that's usually not always but usually because people will get a ford focus uh let's say a three-year-old fraud focus and then buy a tesla i think well it's double the insurance well it's got 300 not break horsepower well that's got 950 that's cost you 40 000 that's cost you 15 20 whatever it costs new that's why it's more expensive because evs are more expensive they tend to be quicker not because of them just being more expensive to insure if you shop around of course which is always key uh gotta send our lovely 2022 mamba green mocha e ultimate for the first service soon always seems strange to me that you have to service evs and i know they're doing it just to get the yearly you know money from people but excuse me i haven't serviced that tesla once it's two and a half years old 40 000 miles not spent a penny because even tessa said there's no point unless it needs something it's fine there's nothing to do i probably will get it checked over though when it's three years old just because it's three years old and you never know and of course the mot will be due i'll be weird i had an mot for a long time apart from you know the tt whatever hmm right dan is also listed home improvements come before ev charges all right so that's the previous listed person well can you put inside the barn maybe alice is back alice are evk how long will we have the testify i have no idea alice for the foreseeable future he's not going anywhere this year certainly do you think the future of personal transport is ev synth fuel and hydro hydrogen i presume articles causing confusion hydrogen will not work for personal transportation it's too expensive it's not green enough you need a colossal amount of electricity on top of what people think we already need for evs and sync fuel is just a a big con quite frankly when it comes to uh well if i was uh selling lots of petrol i i'd think of a green way of producing the same stuff wouldn't it now that's and then the producing such small numbers it's uh point zero zero zero one percent of what we needed so i think electric yes as soon as i can solve the problem with the batteries in terms of raw materials and make them cheaper etc and they will do because there's so much money going into research uh you know laptops and phones as well as cards then the problem with electric cars goes away solid state batteries can be charged up extremely fast so that gets rid of another problem with batteries i mean that's first if you could charge an electric car for a five uh not for a five for the same price as petrol in five minutes or less then people probably wouldn't have a problem with evs it's just at the moment the you can't charge up in five minutes counter so yeah we're still at the early adultery stage of evs for me 10 years 20 years from now who knows where we'll be but it will be the same situation this is not the pinnacle of evs this is the beginning for me excuse me yeah here we go right hi from aberdare i think that's wales what do you reckon about the media coverage about the tb supercharger cues and do you think it will put people off evs part of me wants to say whoa i mean let's face it it's a one-off at christmas it's looking at the queues of uh i don't know the trafford center i go wow look at the queues i'm not going shopping there it's boxing day of course it's going to be busy but that is highlighting a very big issue there are way more cars coming to the market and then the charges are supplied and i don't mean test i mean in general so yeah i don't think if you are very pro ev or whatever you want to call it i think we need to push the networks to put more in push even tesla to put more in because it's clearly needed now but it's getting to the point where i think yeah the media are going to cover anything negative petrol or electric it doesn't matter no one wants a positive uh headline to it it seems um that id5 looked cool on the outside people poo on the inside you know i i really volkswagen i always have them my favorite car i ever owned was a volkswagen corrado of the asics and i just them as a brand in general you know that the whole kind of dope scene that i was sort of in for quite a few years but and i think anybody that's that's owned them for long enough will admit as well the interior of all volkswagens at the moment are worse than the previous generation add that into an electric car which is naturally more expensive and you're thinking why am i sat in here then factoring that skoda and cooper with the bond as well can basically do a slightly cheaper version of the same car but way better interior and it just makes volkswagen look they've screwed it up in fact and this is hearsay i guess but when i was at uh the geniuses event in frankfurt clang um i was talking to someone who was quite high up should we say in uh the hyundai motor group sorry hyundai motor group really high up so you know the whole motor impress was there from most of europe and he was saying that uh somebody from i think he said someone from volkswagen basically give a really good bollocking to someone from skoda for making their car look bad essentially look what they've done with the enyak it's made our id range look terrible any other and i don't know if they've got sacked or anything but basically someone got a a telling off now for me if that were me i'd be having to go the id designers accountants whoever's responsible for that saying how can they do it and we can't but uh but yeah volkswagen have dropped the ball recently and at the moment not seem to be changing it you get a gold fire for about 40 50 grand look at the interior of it the crackers um trying to decide between renault megan i presume the e-tec and the cooper barn or should i spend a bit more and go off the kia nero haven't tried the megan e-tech for long enough to know the cuprabana did uh the nero i very highly rate so for me in terms of interesting the cooper bomb would be the most interesting the nero clearly has the better range by a considerable margin um it depends what you need again if you're doing long journeys on a semi-regular basis definitely the kia you get the seven year warranty with the gear as well you don't with the renault and the cupra so there's that um and it all as i said in the reviews every it's all the car you ever need there's nothing it won't do and you will get 250 miles out of it in the real world um so oh i don't know you know what test drive them all see which one you prefer because they're all an option you can go off just what feels best rather than what's practical if you know what i mean you should say agni v man give me the cat you know what it's harder for me to get a press card now than it ever has been even though the is way bigger obviously than it ever has been go back three years say there was only well excluding fully charged it was only me and maybe one two other uk kind of electric related uh channels so i got invited to i won't say everything but i got invited to most things i'm trying most cars whereas now every man and his journalist dog is doing a youtube and b electric specific channels and because they're from big publishing houses you know uh what's the other one um that big one not electrifying.com the other one anyway whatever the call it's just another arm of auto express or one of the big magazines so clearly they always get the cast first and they can just palm it off onto the sub channels which means there are more of those exist i'm further down the pecking order even though ironically i'm a bigger so it's um yeah it's now a lot harder for me to get a press car than ever it has been corvy didn't help with course um so yeah it is that what family petrol car would you buy at the moment oh that's something i haven't looked into quite a while oh excuse me obviously budget kind of helps um i don't know i had a bmw for a while three series i always really driving one of them focus again kind of one of those cars which can't really go wrong i presume you don't mean focus rs level cars um so oh i don't know what family petrol car would i get on the assumption you cannot charge so no plug-in hybrid either of course tech i don't think that's a question i can i can answer quickly unfortunately hmm okay key is south korean manufacturers are knocking out the park but i need a budget if they know in fact if anybody says what car would you can you put a budget on it because otherwise it's an impossible uh question really to answer even from dorset what do you think of the citric eberlingo i love that thing i mean the range is pretty poor it's 90 to 110 miles but what a machine it's huge in there we got the the long version i'd love to go wild camping in that thing i guess it depends what you need it for good mpv um can get a seven seat version there's not many electric seven seaters out there so if the range is enough it's great when tesla opened it superchargers for all the dvs will it be the same traveling in europe doing long distance or tesla still be better well the thing the difference between a tesla network and all the other ones is that tesla have eight to 16 chargers on average whereas a lot of other ones have maybe two to four you're getting bigger ones now your grid turbine installed they've got eight or more but they're quite rare so yes at the moment tesla will always be the easy option doing long distances purely because it knows where they all are it knows if they're working it knows how many are in use at that time how far your car can go so you literally just put where you're going in and it does it for you you don't have to plan a plan b plan c you don't have to have a card for anything you just plug it in and you walk away so it will always at least for now be the easiest one ec4 that's a great family car yeah i forgot about that one uh e nero phoenix phil never lose your man no no the corner was film devil and the nero ev is it's now called uh that's more of a gary thing i suppose i mean did i prefer the nero because it's bigger and uh so the narrow was based on oh let me get this right um the ionic platform as in the ionic 5 platform whereas the corner was based on a different platform which is rather drive differently i found the nearer a lot more fun to drive than the corner even though they're virtually the same but they're nice different chassis so the corner uh has a smaller boot and rear than the narrow basically do the same sort of range and everything else same more not same battery so for me it's a better car i don't know about the prices though is the corner cheaper at the moment for the same battery size um glad you prioritize honestly over ingratiating yourself to car companies to be fair though i did ask this once because and i think it was after one of the volkswagen videos actually um because as i talked to the guy on uh on twitter basically who works for volkswagen and said i mean we were genuinely not hash we were just truthful and when i watched it back i thought it was it was actually very balanced but i said can you do a negative review that's not backed up with you know with facts if you art you know it's not just trolling the the the the carrot that if it's justified can you do a too negative review and the pr guy basically said no no no absolutely not if you know because they know what they're dealing with daughter if they think that you're being unnecessary or harsh or just i said trolling uh or saying stuff for for whatever reason other than the review then they may have a problem but ultimately not what they were he said what they will try and do is try and get you into another car when it comes out to try and win you back because if you do a let's let's imagine the id3 version two comes out and to do it really well we will then do a this there's the fixed it the brilliant they're back so they will actually try harder so no actually uh it must be our companies most manufacturers or pr people uh actually they don't have a problem i don't know how many actually watch every but i think if you can justify what you're saying and you're not just you know being an idiot then i don't think they'll ever need problems with it but you never know dear maybe sometimes they will prioritize stuff but the day that you start saying something's good because you want to get another one is the day no one pays attention to you anymore as in watching you i have learned though over the years to be a bit more diplomatic if i think that i don't know let's say a piece of the interior is rubbish and we've got that's crap i would say now look at that for me that isn't very good i don't that compared to this car look at it it's not very good so it's backing what you'd say up with evidence whereas a few years back you'd be oh that's rubbish that's rubbish without really justifying why saying it is rubbish peugeot e308 is due out next year which is a hatchback yes i do what stalantis group are doing but they haven't done anything uh for a while have you watched andor yet because it's very good i haven't no in fact in terms of that sort of tv series uh we've just finished boba fett we haven't even started watching the um uh what's called the humor greg one yeah so yeah we're well behind on tv series quite frankly excuse me alice uh lana if you're watching this adult supposed to have some heroes from downstairs i'm i'm getting nibbly thank you uh leaf if cheap for second city cat yeah it would be my dad drives a c-max and would ford to do an ev yeah that's trouble with ford they've done the mustang maki and a transit now i mean let's face it a proper electric fiesta focus c-max big seller if they do it right anyway without banging the drone for tesla too much your ev cat is only as good as the charging network and the networks other than tesla report exactly this when i talked to even the ev haters if you will 90 of the problems people have with electric cars are the charging not the cat the cars themselves are no longer really the problem it's platform cost it's the it's the charging of them on the public network especially if you can't charge at home so to consult that that's my that's more important now is the charging network than the car right my old belief has not gone down in price for two and a half years i bet it has in the last couple of months though unless it's on the lower lower end side just because prices are definitely evening out when it comes to um well all used cars not just electric ones uh any new viewers let me know where you're out in the world i always to know that i've said that every now and then i'm sorry i've got really itchy nose i don't know if you noticed this when you're watching a well excuse me when you're watching a car review or something every now and then i'll be doing this as soon as i start talking to a camera my nose itches it's very weird uh hi from livingston cost e octopus best tariff octopus gore or if you have a supporting charger such as the omi charger octopus intelligent but go is uh you can't really fail on that one uh question aural form orothon plus what app do you oh the heat pump uh what app do you use or extra hardware as installer was a knob didn't give you the manual uh the app is called sensor app and the hardware uh hang on a minute i'm just doing some quick googling for you and center-up violent you will need uh control uh controller it tells you somewhere wi-fi i'm just doing some google interests i wouldn't just bear with me guys sensor home i think it's called basically it's a it's a white box that connects to wi-fi that they have to hard wire into the system you'd think they'd build it into such an expensive piece of hardware but no it's extra i am too small for a tesla really i mean you can put the seats quite far back if you're too small for a tesla then you're gonna be too small for many cars i'll just send a message to alice heroes can't see some nibbles notified right uh okay happy new year yes where are we it's half past nine been here and now we're already at christ i'm wasting a lot of people's time um i can hear fine it's oh my god have we only got to the hearing point this is how far up the list i am now what we've standardized on ccs in europe do you think it's time we standardize on the location of the charge part well i guess you can otherwise everyone left back in the same way and then when you've got two bears next to the same charger it won't work as well um i think we should have one of maybe a few places rather than just literally put it where you want but i guess uh i don't know as long as you can reach whether you're driving or reversing i mean for me personally it should always be at the back to force people into reversing into a parking space it's one of my biggest book bears when you see someone just driving straight into a parking bit as in just a normal not charging and then they're that when they're reversing i can't see i can't wonder why your cats eats because you're too lazy to reverse in it's easier for me to reverse into a spot than it is driving front end and the dump site safer coming out god what is wrong with my bloody nose foreign levels are fine i must be back 20 minutes behind on the text so if you've put something up i am getting to it i'm going down the list i live in western canada and have been trying to order an ev6 as of april this year care of stopped all orders for the ev6 and estimated two to three years before canada might get one wow i love canada nearly moved to western canada spent two weeks there and liked it so much we genuinely looked at to at moving and getting the visas and stuff that vancouver and whistler and banff and jasper all that sort of stuff i just loved it uh charges definitely busier yep oh let's just scroll to the bottom for me give this a second wow i've got so much to go through uh oh my god here we go i found that found it i'm halfway down the page bear with me guys i feel we need more ev garages for upgrades you know that's more run than you think there was one in skipton which is kind of one of the towns close to myself who's been there a few years and i never knew until i struggled to find someone to mot the twizzy and then they did it they're a heavra so if you google hevra h-e-v-r-a i believe that will give you a list of any ev garages sound division still find good uh i mean epping's essex i've seen a lot more reviews in the past few months hello here we go thank you i was getting nibbly you want one as well dear what what do you think guys which is the best one to be caught up with the chat yet which is about i have not caught with a shot though which is the best one i want to know in the comments i'm gonna have a whisper what are you having cream makes your own favorite i'll get a crunchy a fudge and a double decker for me thank you very much oh okay you're both there oh what's your favorite mummy every time crunchy on the screen anyway oh crunchies are awful what i couldn't i come back i just did the word boobs and everything went off um right uh [music] thinking ionic six or may have to buckle to model three hmm i was a guy that i couldn't think of the car from before oh you know what genesis gv60 seriously mr john sims i assume not the guy of life on mars uh gv60 that would be what i would go for hmm love afford the one thing that boils my is when councils installed charges and catbacks i want you to pay for backing as well as charging see i don't mind that too much because you're getting fuel and parking and i guess because you're taking up the space for a fast charger anyway not a rapid yeah it's a tough one i know what you're saying you get charged twice but if you're on a fast charger you're typically parking for a what an hour or two or more so you can you know you can probably shopping or doing other things i'm not sure as your yellow truck behind you got a battery it does in fact well it's not in them six treble uh double a's can you believe foreign this was last christmas we've got a new one this year it's a formula one technique this thing is astonishing i mean the uh that the engineering that goes into it all the gears work all the uh you know it moves forwards and backwards that tilts and you see we've got pistons that go up and down in the engine bay it's absolutely mad but at six six double layers per time to use it's more expensive for to fuel than an electric car on a rapid charger hmm who's me oh fudge all right okay massive increase in evs this year both cars and bands yep yeah tesla are upgrading some of their charges at least you'll find so many pumps are not able to connect to the internet my samsung heat pump has no remote access i don't know about samsung but my villain wouldn't without this uh the extra hardware that connects it to the internet so might be worth checking are what's it called open energy mon monitor sorry google open energy monitor it's not cheap you're looking at you know several hundred pounds but it puts the the install sensors all over the place you know uh temperature sensors and electricity monitors so it basically gives you all the you know the the geeking for and very accurate cop information on your heat pump you can't control it turn it off and on but at least it does give you some sort of online access to what it's doing glass onion is terrible i found an earplug well am i too loud now right okay 100 of your iv charging is done at home our house is not too far off at the moment unless we opportunity opportunistically increase demand at the destination or the red occasions when i am required to commute yeah charging is essentially a you don't it's the mindset i think with a petrol diesel car you get low you fill up or half up or whatever you know but you get to you know the red line two is it and then you fill up whereas an ev if you can charge it up you'll need enough to get you home or to your destination you don't have to fill up as it were and i think a lot of people forget that get some whiskey drunk i don't drink whiskey this is crystal head vodka the onyx version which is why it's uh in the shape of a crystal school yeah it's about 80 quid a bottle 78 to quit a bottle so it's not cheap and it's very good with mixing it's uh danacroid the guy from ghostbusters he owns half of the company i believe he's very uh very good stuff odin or from over the hill dude your sound division just fine thank you very much can't come in on accessibility of public charging as pandemic new normal means we can do all our charging on our electricity at home uh love your got you've got me into my first electric car there is no other down to earth person to present the subject yeah did i just do the guns i'm very sorry about that uh yeah much appreciated thank you uh i think you just got to see how it is because well yeah when i anytime i do a on the car the only kind of metric the only kind of thing i have in my head is it's talking to someone in a pub if you will if someone was sat opposite you're in a pub or a restaurant or wherever and said you've got one of those whatever cars what's it what would you say to that person that that's that's the only kind of thing i try name to do because that tends to what youtube is really it's you're talking to someone foreign pumps have you looked at heat pump dryers we got rid of our tumble dryer because we never used it the uh a tumble dryer for me is the sort of thing you'd use when you got a young baby we'll just use clothes horses and dry it that way naturally because even a heat pump tumble dryer isn't cheap to run uh why are we told not to put a heat pump tumble dry in the garage laughs when he why are we told not to put heat pump tumble dry in the garage when house pumps are placed outside i didn't know you couldn't put in a garage i mean it's got to extract the uh the condensation yeah the the air the hot air and the damp air out so that might be why you're gonna have to have a vent coming out of your garage but i don't see why you couldn't put one in your garage early um i've never had one so i've got italian photo which is the better one to invest in to start up solar battery or a heat pump solar and battery if you can because the battery is cheaper because you don't pay v80 when bought with solar um heat pumps don't often make financial sense unless you've got solar in the battery and the tariff so for me solo because generating your own energy is always guaranteed gonna save you energy and if you can store it and if you have a battery and you can charge it up at night if you're on the right tariff then again you can you can do it through winter as well so for me once a tariff turns up for a home battery i will probably go for the battery first but solar for me is he's always going to save you money guaranteed because you're generating stuff that you're using whereas a battery relies on a tariff that doesn't exist yet unless you have an electric car well getting a bit uh yeah lubricate the old vocal cod hmm and i skipped it out skipped anything passed away no wait brilliant okay uh right okay where am i oh god i've got loads to go through keep the questions coming and where you're leaving all that sort of stuff i promise i will get down to you eventually uh i've heard of people water heaters but not dragons yes there's essentially a heat sorry a tumble dryer uses roughly three to four kilowatt hours of energy which at the current price gap is what one pound 20 30 p for each time you use a tumble dryer whereas a heat pump tumble dryer uses about one one and a half kilowatt hours so if you use one regularly enough a heat pump tumble dryer logically will make sense financially rather hmm can you recommend cheap charge cable for a 2015 leaf just go on um there's a couple of sites that sell okay eco cables or something that just google electric car cables uh and as long as it's uk abyssed company i think you'd be fine because you have to confirm certain regulations but you are looking probably a couple hundred quid depending on type of cable cost excuse me start to melt my foot still got the double decker he pumped tumble dryers are designed to be used inside of heating combs house heat pumps are designed to be it was outside are they greetings for norfolk mosley in north northern ireland uh do you think the genesis is good yes i do i think i'm answering questions that i've already mention um because i'm so far hope the list still as i don't live in uk what is the current level of the plug-in car grant there isn't one in the uk anymore i got rid of it no more grants would you consider a swap for a model y a swap yes but quite frankly for me to get a model y would well i reckon my car is worth about 32 grand at the moment maybe model wise what are they 50 now for the standard range i paying 18 000 pounds to get essentially a standard range model y from a standard range model 3. it's just too expensive i think now i know everything's got more expensive than you have to recalibrate it it's just it's just i just don't see that as a 50 000 pound car mm-hmm i have wonderful heating running via a gas boiler will it work with a heat pump and what changes are required if it does it will be perfect for a heat pump i assume that you are at a temperature of no more than 40 degrees 35 40. so yeah i don't know if any plumbing work needs to be changing but as far as i know because the temperature of the water going through your floor will be the same that we'll just change the uh you know the gas boiler for heat pump and uh just get you the heat calculations done so you know what size heat pump if you get a heat pump that's too small it won't provide enough heat for the house you get a heat pump that's too big it will short cycle so it will come on and off and on and off and on and off and run inefficiently you get a heat pump that's perfectly sized sweet as a nut hmm i think i'm going to say a double decker for the heroes foreign okay i do them whispers are good too excuse me bloody nose it's funny just checked the heat pumps a few hours ago i don't think they're a good option at the moment compared with gas boilers well again everyone's you know damn a lot more expensive so without the solar and the batteries and the heat and the tariff i wouldn't have one at the moment but there's a lot of misinformation out there about them that's what needs changing and bad installers hmm put this down a bit hmm oh yeah my sweets are melting hmm excuse me need to uh get rid of it do you know us must be just talking let's be vibrating my nose says oh mr maloney i finally got down to you for a donation uh i'm gonna have to fill that up again uh thank you mr paul maloney um for your donation to the you know what i'm going to put some orange in this one first shot sir not the tastiest things in the world i have to say i'm gonna be on my ass if i keep doing that but what i will do is have some orange here is you have the same amount in it so i can get some vitamin c going in oh that's nice just fill the uh next one up there we go there we go poor pain strip it there we go ah right cheers okay mfg chargers are smashing it our patronic charges seem to be the most reliable on the market other than tesla contactless works well instable and osprey seem to be the most reliable out there pretty much yep install um not faultless but pretty much the most reliable did you see the fun for louis playlist driving a self-converted diy tesla powered volkswagen classic bus driving from uh no i've not seen i'm guessing it's a youtube uh the new york over winter picking up the wrong glasses uh no no i didn't but uh yeah i'd love to convert a car but it's just it's too blue expensive you should service bricks on the tesla any electric car if the roads are salted in wintertime yeah yeah i give them a good clean at the end of the bypass off enough but i know what you mean i do keep an eye on myself i'm not totally inept but in terms of actually going to a dealer to service them what's the service on an ev i remember when they recorded the uh my leaf getting serviced all they did is plug it into the computer tell me that everything's okay we actually i already knew and then topped up the screen wash and wanted 80 90 pound for it and that's now 150 pounds so what am i paying for you're not doing anything have you changed the tad or smart trvs out for the valiant ambisense ones uh no essentially so i've still got the uh the taddle trvs on all the radiators but all they do now is essentially again i don't know if it'll zoom in and i'll count this camera doesn't seem particularly effective at oh come on you useless thing i mean look at that that i won't bother with that again essentially no um all they do is stop any room overheating so they're all open because the heat pump controller does everything um so at night they go to to 20 degrees i think no 18 degrees so the couple of the bedrooms do shut off uh well i will do 18 excuse me but other than that no so there's no point um all they do is is remain open the whole time pretty much on the heat pump takes care of everything so they just stop any overheating of the room but other than that they don't do anything yeah i don't think i'd need it to replace with even the valiant one because there'd be no real benefit to it a heat pump works best as i'm told for the whole house to be heated turning rooms off is counterproductive hmm that's one of my uh yeah one a day oh [ __ ] is not more powerful than it i remember i need a finish off my double decker about the meat eating on camera not nice going out to get pringles ice cream and beer does anyone need anything whilst i was at the shop pringles ice cream and beer that's a night in i had a new nero since august love it very comfortable but it's a great car they just keep telling me my nero is delayed because they haven't heard anything there's a lot of delays with production uh but you will get it uh it'll be a surprise one day you get what we'll probably do is say it's coming next week even though they told you it was coming in three months so you'll you'll be taken by surprise i guarantee it let's go to octavia vrs for ice alternative very good car actually yes you're right i used to have a an octavia virus first they have a brand new carry over your owned an octavia virus 2008. uh yeah the other superbs go to superb really really good i didn't have a budget just a dog wife wanted de niro said the porsche was too wide yes it is i mean there's a bit of a difference between the past and the the nearer i assuming they mean the taikan uh well with the money you've saved on the nero you could probably just get a secondhand proper partial for foot and she would need to drive that you're better looking than electric van man and make myself into whose electric van run there's an electric van run does that exist i'm gonna have to google that electric van man i can't find anything oh once i get down to that point in the chat who's electric fan man foreign motability leaf 24 now e208 changing next year not driven the mg4 looks bigger it's not massively bigger but it is a little bit bigger than the toy but it's it's it's i think it's a little bit smaller than a ford focus for example but it does drive really well although i the e28 as well no i think you'll enjoy it you'll be fine new toyota prius prime plug-in hybrid looks good you know it's the one car i've never driven a prius and i don't i don't mind toyota i know all the self-charging nonsense gets in the way but they're meant to be very good cars the prius have been um so money no no object what color tesla would you get [music] probably i quite the dark blue okay i can't remember the names i'd probably go for a black one machine policy ceramic cut it yes it will uh occasionally look awful in winter but when you get a black car looking really clean it does look really good and the fact that they've gone black on the door handles and the trim white looks stupid now i think so yeah i think black for me i think that that is an extra and i don't think the red the reds are right but i won't pay was it two two and afghan for it hello from abigaily north wales uh anyone else is anyone else from the outside of the uk as well and there must be more people around the world why did they not make the prius 100 ev well toyota have made their bed they're currently lying in it um they're obviously banking on hydrogen which is clearly not worked and febs i mean i get what they were trying to say better to scatter around a little bit of battery a lot on all cars rather than big battery in some of them but then that doesn't really help forward the technology and speed up the the the research and development of avs it would just slow it down about me lots of burps going um travel from norway to england this summer 4 000 kilometers using ionity no problem had to work two times approximately 15 to 20 minutes on both yeah ionic is a decent network european wide um not meant to be that expensive either um so yeah i think anything's possible but it's just easy with a supercharger network b deal in north yorkshire tumbridge in kent have you come across have you ever came across a car that's truly terrible uh well new one i assume uh well the only joke about the the most when it comes to brand new cars anyway not evs um you might have seen on the transit electric transit the um oh god i've forgot his name oh the the volkswagen t-rock or the rather the convertible t-rock why anybody would want the convertible small suvs beyond me but the car's probably fine actually i mean let's face it it's just a is it a tall polo so technically there's nothing wrong with it but it's the name t-rock it sounds a nickname that that kid at school and we all know who we're talking about it there's a kid at school that wants everybody to call him t-rock but no one will and that's what i think of every single time i hear anybody mention or see a t-rock but a baby blue t-rock convertible just don't see the point in it but there's no such thing as a bad car these days just boring and unnecessary and bland and crackers i don't mind the car with a bit of personality but uh yeah i just don't get the t-rocks off i think i'm gonna do a convertible you know do a convertible uh well we're tom bridging yes i've done that one andar a lot of people seem to these and are any good and the tv series i assumes a lot of people mentioning in under uh nerd question for you would the same battery chemistry be in the 2017-24 leaf as in the current leaf i imagine it's been altered and improved slightly but there'd be no major upgrade there's no there's no thermal management there's no yeah none of that which is why for me the leaf now is just too old it's a good price but when looking at a a new leaf i'd probably just go straight to the mg for zs uh use a lot better it's just my issue with the leaf is that once you get to the seven eight year yeah and upwards period the batteries will suffer because of that lack of thermal battery management unless they've been looked after by whoever owns it so then you unless you know who's owned it before and you're into a bit of a oh how's this been looked after a a petrol engine as i've been looked after and that doesn't just mean has it been serviced because there's no servicing uh so no i don't think the battery chemistry is massively changed it did change between 20 13 14 onwards but as far as i was pretty much the same as it was it's about to be incremental upgrades but not massively so what's the drawing behind you oh yes alex did it a year or two ago of the of the twizzy pvk obviously we don't have the twitty anymore um so yes yeah i always did it basically so one off maybe i should raffle it off and get something for it right me i can i am considering the ec4 or the mg4 oh that's a tough one hmm the ec5 is a lot more comfortable the mg file is better to drive in a fun way but the ec file is a more comfortable drive that don't i assume you mean the long range mg4 because that would that would beat the ec4 for range by about 30 40 miles i reckon oh that's a tough one you know what that's again that's one of those drive them both and you'll you'll just you just twig with one of them you'll you'll rather you'll with one of them and go this one that's that's the right one the mg4 or the ec4 but the very close in terms of they've both got their own good things going for them whereas uh you know the kind of they are kind of different personalities stalantis is bringing out the peugeot 408 which will be the ev version eventually too far away is coming back is it really are you still happy you got rid of the twizzy at this time of year i'm not bothered because it was fun but in in cold weather this it was really well you've no heat and you didn't it's not sealed so you're basically outside um but yeah there are there are times where you think because you could just go out go for a drive somewhere and people will come up to you and ask about it whether you're at work supermarket and wherever so you got a lot of you got a lot of love from it but uh i sold the twizzy and for almost the same amount of that i sold that far i got the convertible tt which is bonkers when you think about it a 3.2 v6 roadster with 40 000 miles on it costs about the same as a tweezy very bizarre uh northumberland here avimo scotland uh bradford again hailing island where's that i'm going to google that healing island hampshire never heard of it uh all right so back to the questions we've got bedworth uh newcastle upon thai oh yeah my page is just refreshed i'm gonna have to go back up to where it was oh wow oh wow i'm oh god i thought we're catching up sorry guys i'm really far behind again uh let's let's see if we can plow through this a bit better he's now a good time to get second on bv uh they've gone down a lot an awful lot i mean my well i said in a recently my uh model 3 from we buy any car which is about the lowest price you're gonna get that was about 37 37 and a half you know in august a few weeks ago probably a month ago now we buy any car simpler sim card 30. so good time better time yes good time ish i would probably say give it another new player in march april and see where we're at they're not gonna go up they're only gonna have to stay the same or go down for a bit um but it's not a bad time if you need one you need one this octopus support the army version one i think so because it's all app controlled so i believe so i need to top this up the biggest problem with talking is that you drink a lot and then you drink a lot and then it's that blow up especially after a big tea in trifle and uh more heroes i haven't even got to the i asked people what half an hour ago what the favorite heroes were i haven't got to that text yet i'm going to have another one though whisper this time i think excuse me uh right here we go south buckinghamshire come on there must be someone from abroad yeah and then all the people from bratton who disappeared down the road at longley and keithley uh hi from wellingborough no thumbs of course e front is the best um i can't remember what that was first i have an mg5 trophy which collected on the 9th so far so good chelmsford essex here mg4 or tesla very different price brackets tesla's about 15 to 20 grand more expensive 30 minutes behind yep yep look at people coming on it asking a question going this is rubbish and then going because i'm taking so long to get there but then i don't want to skip to the end and miss loads of questions easier for me to reverse into a spot too absolutely vodka will start the nose issue it's gone now at least you know for a while so i think i'm okay until you're right well more drink will help you read faster yep there we go fuji is the best yep twister creme egg twister see for me they're just a little bit i them with a bit bit cichlid um a crunchy i hate crunches where's evie cat or you'll be asleep in the city poor little thing he's uh he's got three teeth left in arthritis another person for crunches why do people crunches they're awful hmm whisper yeah definitely twills of the oh no oh god wow rich air sorry i'll just finish my whisper well i won't finish it 8.99 donation very oh excuse me and that needs to go up uh thank you very much that's way more than uh is necessary but i appreciate that so thank you for your ordination oh god my voice is going cheers again guys ah you know what eating sweets with beer and vodka makes everything taste very strange let me get another one ready maybe god there we go oh no it's got vodka on my keyboard got rid of that one and now oh god this keyboard smells of vodka oh what am i there we go yeah yes sorry thank you mr agar for for that incredible donation much appreciated gv60 is a great shot wow i'm still installing that it is i would seriously have bought one have financial situations be different genuinely so do you recommend the north course 500 i would move there if i could yes we're going back uh well not just enough cost 500 but to the highlands in general um and probably most of the north coast is um april may maybe i think something that i mean next year it's fantastic we'll go up there once twice sometimes three times a year for the roads and the scenery the west side with side the west side is is the best the bester called it style is the better one for me the west side of the highlands is the prettier the more remote and the the narrow roads it's just incredible the east coast uh and kind of most of the north you get a lot of nice beaches up there um but it is uh is more it's the lake district it's quite dare i say tourist here which is ironic as as i am one but uh you know there's a lot of it's more built up should we say um so you don't have to do the whole north coast 500. i think that's the thing that i mean we don't now we probably do we we miss bits out once you've done it you've done it so you think well there's no john uh yeah jonah gross for example it is just a sign and uh and then a cafe that does nice pizzas but other than that there's not really any reason to go there other than say you've been there so there's a bit you can cut out on that section which saves you about an hour's driving maybe more two maybe yeah enough driver just to cut it out and then carry on um this time round we're staying inverness uh sort of area and then cutting clear across to the top corner and then coming down the west coast back ending up at fort william um so yeah not of course 500 100. uh that's amazing unfortunately because i was supposed to do half an hour ago i don't know what that's refers to oh i wonder if it's the uh the lego thing that is incredible i'd love to show you it working because it literally is it changes gears it's lego that changes gears to go faster it's mad whoever engineers that it's probably more complicated than the car it's absolutely insane do you have any thoughts on fisker in the ocean uh well until they bring it again it's another one of those that we'll get in a few years now i did have a good look at it at the uh at goodwood festival of speed and it was all right but it was just another suv for me it wasn't you know that special and we are talking about the same character yes that one um and it was nice and if the price is alright which let's face it it's never the price to say it's going to be in the uk is it ever um so we'll see what it's in the command it's another option so does that you're supposed to move we're not charging so you are paying to pack whether you charge or not until you'll have to move after you're done charging true uh what do you think about vin fast uh let me just google that i mean something not been fat i've been fast vin fast electric cars vietnamese private automotive company let me guess it's another car company we'll never see in the uk or maybe we'll i don't know i've known nothing about them beyond pictures from fastly so yeah oh no it's been a while since i pronounced this so i apologize so uh here we go al salam alaikum is that right uh happy new year basically i i always get that wrong but you know what i'm saying uh should hybrids be banned from rapid charging it's not a problem anymore the only plug-in hybrid that could rapid charge was uh the outlander and ever since the rapid charging got to the point where it was more expensive than petrol you will never see a hybrid on a rapid charger or you shouldn't so for me if someone was charging actually charging then that's enough because at least they are charging it was just charging at such a slow rear which annoyed people but no for me i'm not too bothered by hybrids because unless you're at home at the moment you don't make financial sense to charge on the public network about me again has anyone placed an odd of solar panels and batch storage that's mine in may still no installation the batteries arrived but still parts for the solar still waiting stock yeah and there's massive massive uh kind of push for solar and batteries excuse me huge huge huge push everybody's wanting them the energy crisis obviously meant a lot of people suddenly started looking at them that me that never were before or at least you know thought about me but didn't um and the the industry can't cope with the demand quite frankly and uh the amount of batteries that are sold from all manufacturers has gone up massively to the point where they literally can't make them quick enough from from what i understand from various twitter feeds anyway and manufacturers say we're literally building them at capacity more production lines are going in and we just can't keep up so it's just one of those things it's buying a car but sometimes you have to wait for one unfortunately you just you've done it at the busiest time ever in the industry i'm surprised at the soil a bit though i would have thought the usual you know since may i mean to be honest that's not too bad for the battery me from what you understand though again going for a few twitter feeds from manufacturers a lot of the uh stock issues for batteries and what says gone but it's a lot better but then you've got all the backlog for the installers to install them on and now we're looking at shortage of installers so you can't everyone unfortunately people want things oh can you not doing next month it's nearly summer we've got a massive lead time we're so busy i'm afraid we can't if somebody can ring up get solar than a battery within the next few weeks i'd be concerned why they're not so busy to be honest because everybody should be rammed yeah oh yeah we've got my whisper my 2018 leaf technica technica techna has just passed a hundred thousand miles and he's running perfectly or no more warranty for you then but battery anyway but yeah apparently evs can't do 100 000 miles it's just one of those things once there are more out there people will get used to it and that whole thing will go i'm based in northeast scotland uh anyone experiencing similar to below i'm not sure what i was talking about what average kilowatt at peak you use on the heat pump per hour where's my look [music] i better show you the app if the damn thing worked on my webcam um but this gives me the uh it's not that accurate in terms of it evens it out loud but overall it is enough to show what it's used or maybe it don't the one thing i will say about valent is that their servers are shockingly bad in terms of i would say about twice a week to go down for a few hours it's awful it's oh here we go back online all right so let's go back to the worst day which was uh the 14th of december we used 32 kilowatt hours for heating for the heat pump and the most it used in a single let me zoom in yeah between eight and nine was three kilowatt hours so use three kilowatt hours um at its most essentially so um when it was at its prop coldest including so all i can see is what the house is using unfortunately at the moment but essentially it hovered between two and three kilowatts for the bit that's with the house and the heat pump and you know just general stuff being on in the house so once you knock the house off we're probably looking at around between one and two kilowatts for my heat pump i've got a five kilowatt heat pump and remember the heat pump rating is not how much energy uses it's how much heated outputs so a five kilowatt heat pump will not use five kilowatts of energy i think mine will use at most about two and a half 2.6 kilowatts or something according to the manual um so yeah it's it's one of those where in winter for a couple of weeks of the year it will probably use or cost as much as gas does but for the other 50 weeks of the year it will use less obviously i'll be doing a after winter ends with all the facts and figures and stuff that no one says about low fuel and pg for petrol and diesel manufacturer says 50 miles per gallon i bet most people will get 35 to 5. here's true for years we've had you know people might say advertising at whatever mpg and you never get that and we got used to it whereas electric cars are often camera said oh well it says they get 250 miles i want to get 180 in winter well that that's normal i've got a hair stuck on my nose i'm sorry oh sneak back keeps back so yeah it's um it's just manufactured you know what they're not lying they're going off the wltp scale which the european yeah the eu rather implemented so it's useless to tell you how many mounts you've got but it is okay for a metric based on other cars sort of um but yeah it's uh it's always been the case in it i said the mpg's never matched but the heat pump it depends on house temperature and the size yep good man raising a glass with you yeah thank you very much what size battery do you have uh the the battery i've had for a while um although there is something happening with it soon uh was eight kilowatt hours in total uh not total so usable um so i will uh we wanted to top that up hmm top yorkshire tip for me for me keep the crystal uh well this for the next year and refill with any vodka it's the sort of thing unfortunately is that type of vodka and i'm not i'm not a big drinker i can count on one hand how many times i've been drunk this year um three fingers probably but when you have expensive something whiskey drinkers will probably know what i mean you can't go back to the cheap stuff it's just not the same it really isn't just purchase six kilow hours of battery storage for 1500 pounds from the british company of the 10 year warranty who would that be i believe you need an inverter on that as well yeah but uh my battery under your batteries are too small to service your heat pump at the low tariff electricity rate yeah but it's only for a few weeks of the year so it doesn't have to do every kilowatt hour uh how much have you had there is still two hours to go is it wow it's 20 past 10. uh i don't know how much have i had four five shots that's a bit of beer so it's not massive i'm thinking about getting oh nice too fizzy no that's that's a bad idea i'm still looking the heroes though i said we have something savory um what have we got i don't think we've got anything in other than this this is christmas isn't it this basically sums up christmas does anyone else get to the point where you're going yeah i've had enough of that now well it's before christmas it's oh give me that give me that hmm double decker again i think oh god this itchy bloody nose of mine uh right let me skim through the questions really quick and let me know by the time i get to that question shall i get the uh the girls up should we get them involved should we get there you know you can ask them questions right let me uh let me go down let me go down let me go down uh most of the chocolates in the tubs if you've got smaller definitely have electric leaf man yeah uh are you on the youtube normal 40 seconds delay uh i don't think i don't know i just pressed go live on the streamlabs has reported in the sun today do you think evs will suffer a downturn in sales in 2023 well the uh i will probably say because the cat produce enough to meet the demand last year i think we will get to the point where there's not a massive waiting list there will be still some for some cows i think that you want to see a drop-off of company car uh leases i think they'll definitely be a little drop because not if you notice but leases for evs well for every car not stevie's has gone up significantly they're going to be a lot of people uh renewing a lease and then going whoa hang a minute i can't find that now because it's going up 200 quid a month or something silly foreign how does a ceramic coating on the model 3 time for a new that's a good point [music] um the trouble is it's very difficult to test because when you clean a car you get you clean it with shampoo and the shampoo will leave residue on it which has a beading effect of sars so you've got to clean it and then kind of get all the shampoo off with uh with a panel wipe and then see what effect it's having so yeah maybe i should do another on it maybe after witnessing over about three years then it's probably probably about gone by now after a good ev with suv with good range need to know your budget um test this thunder drainage plus on ebay for 28 grand i'm 97 on the clock um they're uh they're getting better you should drink cider i never never gone with cider happy new year should i trade my leaf 24 in for the zombie 40 i wonder you can answer that i'm afraid the range difference will be very noticeable you'll probably double your range easy so if you do long journeys on that huge difference which ev would be on none by and which color on the outside i have no idea whatever one's the easiest they don't do a rover ev do they mg there you go you actually do hmm probably the cheapest does it what do you think of the kia keys are very good in fact probably one of the best overall try another double decker i've just built the home battery storage system moved to octopus gone to an economy 7 tariff i don't have an ev yet or any significant amount of solar but i'm still saving over one pound per day let me go 300 and you know nearly 400 could a year and that's the thing in it found electric van man on youtube it was an electric fan one on youtube let me have a look electric van man um i can't can someone post a link up to it i can't find this oh wait a minute no no there he is electric van man obviously just started out hmm i'm talking about that maybe when i first started out years ago when there were four evs around there's only a few vans it probably explains why there's been a month between that and that once you've done a few videos i said there's only so many av fans around um never knew it existed we have a big dog and take him in the ionic five boot easy the only five sir big car though it's a real big cat it doesn't look it ontario canada hey i'll say it again any new viewers that are just joined us over the last half hour where are you in the world what do you think of being faster again how far it's because i'm going over the same question hello from lockerbie in scotland what are we drinking there we go landlord got a few more over there i don't it's not over here yet i'm not uh so again it's very difficult to get older cars especially the ones that don't exist in this country i am not properly yet if someone gives one i absolutely will do it yet will take me over five years to break even but when it wasn't the other driving factor doing my victories the lord on grid i got a new battery you much flooding down there in lockerbie why is it flooding in scotland is it my in-laws have a t-rock oh my god have we only got to talk about the tea rock how far behind am i uh theory nesborough i'm looking at the maxis e deliver three tradesman that cost ten thousand miles around towns is it worth jumping into an e van at that mileage you better do it i'm guessing the ford transit runs out of your the financial reach because they are more expensive but it is just a transit van if you can't charge at home though it's not really going to save you any money at the one i'm afraid because the public charging is almost as much that's the big difference for it to make sense and it would make sense you need to be able to drive at home um podcast 2023 yes things are in place in terms of the podcast the reason why we couldn't or haven't done the podcast for several months is purely down to time we both well we're working with the same place but but we both work full time on it friday typical job then that means the evening and weekend for me to do this the as well as family stuff and visiting and holidays and illness all that sort of stuff uh harry's basically the same sort of thing you know it's basically a single dad uh family stuff house stuff and to do the podcast you got to get together for at least two to three hours even though it's probably only an hour now and after the actual podcast itself it's just time so we decided rather than do one very sporadically and at random intervals we'll just wait until we can do it properly and then it's just never it doesn't look look it's going to happen and the problem is it will probably be one thing that will never make money in terms of you do a and it will bring in at least something even a not a great you know viewed whereas podcasts there is no monetization uh for the free stuff anyway um and no one's going to pay for our podcast so it was just the way we did because you know we enjoyed doing it it's fun it is fun to do but out of all the things if something else they gave it had to be the podcast but what we are thinking of doing i've got a another microphone over there can you see that white thing there i'm going to get into his house and we're going to try and defense so he'll record himself there i'll record me here we'll do a an online call in his hit in his headphones and in theory i'll be able to marry the two audios up so we can do a podcast without one of us having to physically be at the other person's house so we are planning on doing it again just give us time and because we don't want to do it badly if that makes sense so it will get there it will get there because i do doing them good fun it's this you just have a bit of a chat hmm south yorkshire huh why don't saloons have rear wipers uh as far as you understand it because the boot went so close to the window the white people were getting away i don't know if that's still the case but that's how that's what i remember thinking from years ago oh god my page had just refreshed again oh jesus come on get through this text get through this text turn me on half thing don't freeze area lots of flood in there greetings from essex looking to replace gas central heating with solar battery infrared should the battery be sized to cover all usage in winter it's one of those things where there's no point in spending a few thousand pound extra to get double the battery sized or however much it costs just to cover three weeks worth of occasional dipping in you know of a few kilowatt hours per day so if you can afford it and it's a bit you know you might as well do it the install but there's no point in having two batteries and one of them is barely getting touched because during the summer you don't need the full capacity if you know what i mean there's there's a there's a fine line between you want you want slightly above your typical usage i think for 10 months of the year 11th of the year in terms of battery capacity if you can go much higher fine it's not going to hurt but in terms of financially at 12 months to know what you need but you can't add batteries at any time in the future so it doesn't mean if you don't go for it you can't have it later so does that uh hello uh our paths are so close detail about definition watching your uh give energy system two 9.5 batteries five solar off-grid gateway itself worked out and now asking heat pump or not i used to be a detailer i guess that's what you meant um i hate with what you've got on the assumption you've got and not a time of day tariff as well a heat pump will be cheaper to run but you will probably not get your money back in the same way you would with solar battery they're not a massively great financial proposition depending on your house if you've got an old house it's going to cost you more probably if you've got a relatively new house by me then yeah i mean i'm i'm probably saving four or 500 quid a year with a heat pump because of the rest of the stuff i have so 15-year payback period depending on how much the oz will cost so if you match that 500 quid let's say 500 quid a year to make it easy and you spent 10 grand 20 years it's a it's hard to say i mean that's that's based on today's electric prices in theory five years from now 10 years from now electric will be more expensive because naturally things just go up they might come down a little bit from this ridiculous bit we're in but inflation is inflation isn't it so i don't know at the moment it's probably a if you want to and you can afford it why not get rid of guts completely you're looking to get a heat pump for to save you money the solar and the batteries do it's a harder so uh electric catering that'll be fun that'd be that'd be dangerous oh god all that talk kill yourself uh 90 hour my garage 3.2 kilowatt solar next month i will be changing from lead acid to lithium batteries good good good will the id buzz vance by the end of suvs uh i think more people will look at one but it depends on the price if you can get an suv for 20 grand 25 grand in ev world well all right close to 30. you're not going to get a bus for that so if someone brings a cheaper version of the buzz out i guess i don't know i mean that's why i quite the uh what was it the lingo because it just it samples in tons of space relatively cheap it was a perfect utility vehicle and yeah maybe i hope so because suv's less fitted not really nice hmm that goes from portsmouth stellantis electric our bath so all about the exhaust noise yeah i've seen the specs of the outback because i did consider maybe looking at one when they came out but it's a little bit quicker than the standard fiat 500 meant to be fun a drive that's what they're aiming for but i don't know it's just it's a warm hatch not that impressive for me spec wise but who knows it might be a hoot to drying and that's that's the main thing uh in-depth question for you well i'm trying to skim through it how do you find the give energy app do you use the what's that consumers popped up go away uh do you use the quick mode select function every time i use it it sends five individual commands to update settings inbox so uh no to be honest all i do with my batteries say charge at the cheap period at night and discharge for the rest of the day and never touch it other than that there's no need to really charge up when it's cheap power the house for the rest of the time that's literally our ascended to quick mode doesn't really do anything for me i don't need to use it um last time it ended up not clicking back into eco mode how to get a spot to fix the setting which would have only been accessible engineer menu there is new firmware queen i believe in the next few weeks for the give energy batteries which solves all these issues uh i think it was due to come out in the middle of december but the same they want to wait until it's properly finished um only two hours to go oh my god i'm half an hour behind you go you're going to fully charge harrogate yes i will um best moment this year for reviews oh it's got to be genesis because we flew to stuck gap no we didn't we flew up front for jesus uh it was the first event i've been on abroad since kovid i think yeah and we both got out there hotel was astonishing great food proper event since corvid events were not really been put on because manufacturers don't want to risk it being canceled and costing them lots of money so yeah that that i enjoyed hmm do you think the model s plaid is too much for the average uk road driver when would you use it at the max on the road yeah but to be honest there's a locker let's visit you can get a golf uh gti gold fire with hundreds of breakers and i think the golf cart is in under four seconds now that used to be the highest of supercar territory and um yeah you're gonna get people killing themselves on it oh am i buffering i just want to double check that um what's the realistic answer to lack of public superchargers which need more foreign any fast car you don't have to drive it in mach 6 that's true i finished washing up happy new year to everyone in advance good stuff hmm when i had mine fitted the installers fit the panels when the weather was good three weeks later fit the inverter when it arrived another month delays later came back with battery yeah they're just installing it when it when they can trying to be as efficient as possible i suppose i moved into my house in july plus in order for the battery installed straight away got installed late in november we all had to get a quote they were swamped yep how did you change your battery setup to deal with your heat pump uh well uh i haven't at the moment i've got to yeah i put something in place but i'm waiting for the for that one when eventually everything's done uh oh oh evg here is is here if everybody finds uh evg post edna rogerson for anyone if you haven't seen it the ev6 versus evg uh ev grandma she's online although this was 20 minutes ago when it was posted so i'm not gone offline by now i am i'm going through this though i'm going well uh land but there's a lot of welsh people on today not bad thing i'm just wondering you know lots of wealth people that's good still not many people from abroad are you from are you watching this from outside the uk let me know excuse me uh on the tesla model y not home charger cost as much to run as my focus rs um that which i do well when did you initially place your oh that's for someone else um oh and there's my brother leave eb it's popping my head in uh happy new year lots of that and we're getting we're not there are we thankfully it's 10 16 and people are already setting fireworks off here 10 16. i thought it was catching up i'm getting worse have you looked into tap your boilers no point with the heat pump um i did consider one at one point but they weren't out it wasn't an option followers at the time so uh i the idea of them i i just still quite niche and there's not enough out there to to have a really good impression out of the opera how they operate ah good day from down under foreign must be weird christmas in summer very strange when is evg taking over your job oh yeah i tell you if uh if if avg didn't leave 510 mile round trip away it should be in a lot more that'd be fun good members only videos that i think uh good suv with good range up to 40 000 pounds evie that's where i'll go for uh perth western australia how many viewers have moved back to petra well ice from ev and also back to gas centralia source heat pump i don't think anyone have gone from heat pump to central eating you won't spend anywhere from you know several thousand to ten thousand dollar more on a heat pump and then go on i don't this and get rid of it if it was costing them too much to run it's because it was incorrectly installed not because of the heat pump itself uh going back to petrol from electric i think the odd people doing that 99 people doing that will be people who lease who suddenly find that the least prices of everything has gone up significantly and now an ev is out of the bracket that they're probably looking at no i've got to get rid of this pardon me apologies we've just traded up our two and a half year old mgs zsev for an mg4 trophy uh yep v2l where is harry oh oh it's just refreshed and now i've got to get find out where i am there we go i'm nearly there every time it refreshes it goes straight to the bottom so i have to scroll up to where i've got uh i found it found it found it found it where is harris since he was not here last year he should be here we all miss his curtain shirts now 10 25 when i post this message um uh yeah harry's at home being a dad probably getting drunk if i know him would you believe it hyundai dealerships are freedom of writing of service jobs really hi from cambridge good when are you going to do a camper tesla you know what we have been meaning to do that for a while it's obviously only going to be two of us not all three of us um yeah yeah i'll try and get one of those in podcast with special guest an option no one watches it that listens to it rather um and to be honest even if i had loads of special guests you've got the same problem how do we get together with them if i can do i don't know friday on an eight o'clock chances are they can't so we'll we'll get it back we'll get it back i'm saving up for a second-hand e-transit or equivalent when they are reasonable turn it into another electric camper i've loved to do that i keep on going back to it and you know you've gone that youtube rabbit hole where you watch a in my case uh of campervan conversions where people do it themselves and you watch another then another then another anything oh maybe maybe [music] um special guest lee from mcmeister you know what i have considered contacting him because if you get rid of the clickbaity bloody titles he uses all the time a lot of what he says is is correct the charging network isn't good enough but then he goes electric vehicles will never work because look at the charging network today yeah i don't know it's probably one of those who just end up banging your head against the world he did a of the evs were rubbish and said oh the charging network is crap but that one's quite good and i the car and he got so many views i think he's just jumped on that bandwagon and keeps doing it now yeah i saw a bit of lag well i think i'm okay now hopefully ever thought about doing a collaboration with other channels such as mr ev who's mr evie mr evie i think i know what you mean um oh yeah andrew yeah um late break electrifying let break show johnny smith is way bigger than i am uh electron.com again they're uh there are well-funded organization she was able i think there was six seven people working for them so i if there was a reason i guess if a contact i'm saying would you to do this and it was a it was a good idea that probably would but then it needs to be a good idea and i find a lot of if you had a bigger i imagine this happens i don't know if someone has 200 000 subscribers they're probably not going to do a collab with someone with 50 000 because only the smaller is probably going to benefit from that collaboration i imagine anybody watching my will also watch lit breakshaw for example i mean i don't know i've occasionally uh messaged johnny smith um that seems a very nice person so i'm sure if i had a good enough idea for the then yeah yeah he'd probably say yes but he's a very very busy guy and so am i and again he said that time thing and the idea i'm not sure what idea think of an idea that i can come up with that can do with just jumping a song johnny smith that would require this collaboration and absolutely i'd love to do you think we need to be concerned around the fact that all the battery solar systems use cloud-based management man i know what you're saying but i think it's a fact of life what doesn't use cloud-based management now the anderson charger that went offline that map meister was complaining about you can still use it offline you just don't have some of the smart features so i didn't watch his but i saw the thumbnail oh my god my charger spent he bought the most expensive charger in the world that they sold and then the company went bust but you could still use it as a dumb charger but i don't know whether or not i said that in the so as far as i know all the ones i know omi does i think the other ones that i've looked at do um have offline mods so it's not really a problem but it needs cloud sort of interaction for things to work um right um only one more hour of free charging on child support scotland ah several councils introducing charging from the first of january well i can't say i'm too bothered about that because hopefully it will give them enough revenue to actually keep the bloody things working but hmm yeah all right well yeah another 15 minutes it's probably what we're working watch him from spain there's been i don't think yeah have you used home assistant to integrate all your tech you know what i was literally looking into that today i mean i work in i.t so should be able to handle it but yeah i i do want to get that going i've just created a new vm so i probably will do that again just need time to sort it out and if i do want to film the whole thing that changes the whole setup because every little step you have to make sure you it so it slows it all down but yeah i don't want to do something with it i mean our next trip now stop off at perth broxton park and ride council have built a new low cabin hub with about five times another rapid and se chargers is that the one with there's a mcdonald's on a petrol there's a petrol station in mcdonald's at the park around here that's perth did they have loads of superchargers at the top of the car park you know is that exactly the perfect one i'm thinking of um our first the soul is still a good recommendation for solar batteries or the last july after watching our installed you in february i'm just refreshed again there we go um uh hoping they helped us uh yeah i mean i've spoken to them about this because obviously you get any complaint i get as opposed to their game and they said they just they just snored under he gets to the point where you think well we're waiting on a path to come from ex manufacturer this was not literally stop we can't do anything so we go and do another job and then the battery will come into we'll install your battery and then we'll come back and do the solar when that arrives it's just the industry's on its ass quite frankly because they're so busy but they're a big company they've been here a long time it's a family run and owned uh that would be perfect because no one is in that industry especially um but yeah i i've no reason to to say no so to just keep on it that's all i would i would suggest make sure you you know you chase them up in january and say is this still happening for example and they do that with any company by the way uh home assistant works great yep yep i am doing it i do i've started to watch videos on on the thing but um it's a rabbit oil it's probably going to take up a lot of my time now i'm thinking about another one ooh hmm i don't know which one now oh didn't know they did full-size twirls in these things hmm no i don't know you know what leave it for a second i'm gonna be good i'm gonna be good uh has ev w ivd plugged in and charge the car while not at home no i don't think they have we can ask them should we get them up let me know if you want them to get him up um do you watch beyond nylon's youtube very rarely to be honest it's one of those things that don't come up on my uh home page so i keep on forgetting about it but a lot of it is not relevant to the uk i'm very good at what it does don't get me wrong i mean very popular but uh doing a thousand mile trip is something that just doesn't happen in the uk so it's kind of a i will say it's not pointless one because it's a good metric but it's one that doesn't really happen in the real world no one's a thousand mile journey apart from maybe once once every three years or something i want to know how the car operates doing 10 15 mile trips on and off because that very much affects the range compared to just a single long journey but no no i'm a really good but no no i don't really watch it to be honest there's so much on youtube you kind of got to pick a jews uh as an example the give energy system can be locally controlled via some sort of terminal access system yeah yeah uh but if given if you want both forums would have aftermarket yeah most things have local control so i'm not too worried i mean think about all the smart speakers that you're getting netflix and you know amazon prime is all cloud-based it's just the way we are and it's the world isn't it do other countries have a means of reversing charger slots let's do refreshed again there we go uh trying to find it there we go how will we know who is next on stacked charges well that's the problem isn't it if there's a cue who determines where that queue is if the cat packs over there because he's waiting for a charger and someone just drives up as that guy drives out he's not going to see the other car so i don't know oh what's this cool andalusian mountains let's have a look at that what's that doing into lucy mountains very posh sounds nice it says he's warm spend hmm very nice very warm right now that it's quite warm here so it's about eight nine degrees which for december i think it's fairly warm fairly mild hmm obviously i didn't contact with buid none at all but maybe i should send an email if they're actually bringing it here um again it's all the uk stuff tends to be behind you unfortunately uh oh i think i'm catching up on nearly catching up shall i get the girls up they might be watching um ev6 was a very similar price we'll have to wait another couple years before i can change people having conversations in this company that's right right um should we change it up a bit should we change it up a bit um oh not a message who's this [laughter] hello hannah just can't figure out how to put a message on this one's you have to sign into youtube and type that's it basically oh i know we're not missing loads of messages sorry i'm just checking my own messages while i'm live streaming to the world as you do as you do is it new year nice we've got just over an hour till we get to new year it's not too bad right um i assume people are still watching this and check the concurrent viewers so we get uh evk and evw up yeah why not let's do that i assume they're watching but i don't know if you're watching you might as well come up bring nibbles non-sweet related nibbles uh tell us about the membership perks for 2023 good point well sims before really um with one edition so if you become a member by clicking on the join button next to membership uh sorry next to you can't do an ios devices for reasons that i won't go into but essentially you'll get videos early typically i put up a members only on sunday and then it goes up for everyone else on friday uh occasionally i'll do a that's just for members um but that that's fairly infrequent so if i'm an event i might do a little there um but i'm also going to do this essentially a live stream not with all that or anything uh and a lot shorter but a live stream where people can just ask questions and and that's the way of contacting me direct because i get a load of emails even though i put at the top of the page don't email me for questions on what you should get or what you shouldn't get this is for commercial purposes only because i don't have time one day i got 50 emails from people wanting advice and i thought i can't keep this up i'm literally that's going to be my job so i had to stop um so this way is i think the best way of doing it members if you for 99p a month essentially if you really want you can come on to the live stream ask the question get your answers or you could put the question in the comments below i'll sort that out later on um and i can answer the questions in the comments so uh you can watch it back later so that's essentially what members will get for for 99p for three kilowatt hours worth of energy a month that's essentially equivalent of the price cap anyway um so yeah that's it really you could pay more if you want or uh or just the 1990 whatever's good and don't forget youtube tick a third of that and then the taxman e texas is junk after that one so i get very little up from it in in real terms but it does have a little helps now there was another well people had a few questions on it let me just see if i can remember where it was uh you know what happened in this for a while i'm gonna need to go to toilet as well i'm really when they come up i need to go for a quick wizzle uh questions questions announcement i've done that one there was a where people were putting questions on it and i can't find it because i'm useless there we go that's already been us that's already been asked happy new year i think most people have done this yeah done that one button turbines done that one i've been pretty efficient i've done knowledge wow look how good i am is there an evm merch store there was hence the mugs that one and i know it's gone there was a there was a few various things really but the guy that uh the company that did it and sent it all out they uh just stopped took a bit of money from people from what they were telling me as in people were telling me saying i've ordered this and it never arrived i never got any you know the guy stopped messaging me back so i'm well i guess this is just stopping um merchandise is one of those that it's a lot of faff quite frankly to get it sorted out either you mix all little from it because the the company itself does everything you know it boxes it it pulls it off yeah you get it's so little for it it's not really worth it or you've got to do all the stuff yourself for the sake of making i don't know a pound on a mug or something that so it's just not really worth it to be honest um and to be honest i'm not sure that many people will really be bothered about it uh an evm mug and how many people use mugs um i keep on thinking if i could think of an ev specific product i could put the name on that'd be quite interesting but it needs to be quite you know quite useful and just to talk and you know everyone's got mugs oh third to youtube yep yep youtube take a third of uh of the of the revenue just apple from apps and stuff that i'm guessing they're not watching because they haven't come up let me send them a message now uh bring nibbles oh i put gibbles nibbles it's not easy typing on one of the things bring no balls if you don't see the message then my vlog right um ice scraper that's not a bad idea in fact no that is a terrible idea sunset his and i scrape through something in evie on it never needs because you preheat the cat but i you thinking though all right you think since your last second on ev cars you see prices coming down recently or anytime soon they've already come down um so yeah i i expect them to come down a little bit more but then for an average sort of area um so yeah i just picked up the wrong glass but oh well might as well go for this so cheers everybody we're at 11 o'clock an hour to go um cool now why not i'm gonna live one state cheers guys yeah weird in it you start drinking when you're old enough you think this is nice and then it it never really gets any nicer but you still do it all right don't get me wrong this is this is all right but vodka by itself is actually fat i need to stop drinking there's no real benefit at all just take the money makes you silly but i said i can count on one hand how many times i've done this sort of thing so why not what you drinking who's watching this if you're still watching this that is let me just move my speaker uh microphone okay uh all right they've got the message there on the way happy new year for everyone in europe uh when your last videos yeah price oh yeah prices are not plummeting but they well they are plummeting but the the getting to a more of an average for for evs um the one emergency piece of kit i have is 100 watt 12 volt inverter apparently i get eps fitted to the give energy system give energy bringing a gateway out in the next i know a couple of months or so which essentially means that the entire system will power the whole house just the tester gateway will do you won't even know if there's a power cut oh have you brought nibbles good what's that um let's make some space oh what we got then so we've got sprinkles fingers nibbles more drinks what have you won have you had anything or drink no is that your first no second just second okay well do you want to put that one around this side all right remove this now one of you can take over because i need a week yeah i'm kind of you're not put thing when you if you're in the car and you went over a bump uh place rosemary crackers all right all right where which one there you go thanks cork's bad for you shouldn't be having cook ie not some malibu no okay i will have some pringles though i don't mind cool and you will be on your phone you don't need your phone i'm putting on silence does anybody else so on this edge that's bitterly glued to their phone permanently i'm 12 by the way there you go between the ages of well for an age let's see i mean at least i have the excuses it's got to work related for most of it you just watched utter crap on youtube i want you that's what i said that's a crap can we all fit him wait wait i don't know i think so yeah i'll move back a bit in fact i'm going to move back oh hi there go for the week i remember you and i also remember spencer i'll be back in a minute guys can we get the window ask any questions now and then by the time i get back it'll be all right ask me questions [music] yeah i am very tall thanks um oh is this someone who's doing two-way library just on my 12 year old over christmas saw her about 10 meters the whole 10 minutes i can't tell okay so all the comments are on there i i yes neil i am i am allowed booze here yeah well it's a shandy thing is we don't have any then it becomes a massive thing doesn't it oh the mystery of alcohol etc whereas if she just does a drink my child lives in a room on phone yeah i don't live in my room but she lives on my phone just in it a room randomly yeah depending on where you want to be anyway secondary school it's actually not that bad right now well hopefully it stays that thanks for asking first term in another six years to go okay this could get interesting if it goes wrong right by the speaker oh oh you probably heard that okay here we go yep we're all right we're okay we've not damaged the speakers it's fine it's good it's fair to us how i wasn't in high school i'm not really gonna be on there oh that was good i'm glad that wasn't good i don't well this is about as wide as it can get um you can come behind maybe one of you how did we do it last time we were in a different setup you were over there with a desk it was you've changed the rooms because it's over here on your knees oh there you go there everyone can tears no i know i'm just kind of right right right so whatever uh that's spencer right now i love the older christmas so about 10 yeah 10 minutes to hold nine day of it yeah of course um everybody is on the phone spot youtube channels keep asking about merchandise but yes it's only the company that makes the merchandise and makes the money i've already answered it's true that's why i started the members or anything really because i think at least i can give you something or something question well so i just devoting it and walk away you carry on can i just check which order are we in is that the order right so these are the new comments at the top of it at the bottom new ones are at the bottom right okay hired to sally baba alibaba's mrs because i've just read that bit she said hi to evie k and evie evw so yeah mrs is waving through the other room all right yeah so i'm saying hiya why are you not watching us it's not this is as good as netflix to be fair i haven't been watching until i got cold i was watching well no we were watching did you see my comments i put on we were watching the christmas the christmas special strictly that we've missed yeah yeah it's i said nice the secondary school's fine i've got the lid okay go pick it up there yeah excuse me you're buying because heat pump is worth it i can't reach it i'm saying that or taking off my job evm sounds keith lemon lemon [laughter] what's the family opinion on the heat pump do the uh get rid of the mini thing first slow down sorry this isn't texting you may it's 100 mile an hour right so i i time for ibm to go and join the cat yeah cat's in the garage he's in the garage well actually he's probably in the garage he went out for a week he'd probably come back in well that's not very nice okay what was that all right the minute anyway the minute yeah so the minute no i do i've always liked the [music] 12 year old interrupting you oh yeah go on your phone fantastic twizzy sorry i'm moving on with the comments as well it's a very good drawing excuse me it's in the background it's the longest car we've ever run it's gonna show the picture i've already destroyed it all right okay yeah if you watched it i'd know that wouldn't i sorry okay are you taking the mic out of people with their success no you know i always do accents i tend to make out of everybody spencer thanks yeah so no i do i the mini i'm not so bothered about the sports effect on it [music] that's what i mean so i'm just i just enjoy driving it it's uh there is potential it's easier to to park along the street than it's the test is that the most important thing when we're looking at a car how easy it is to park bear in mind that the twizzy is the smallest car in the world yeah it was a totally strange and special concept it was just yeah but then when i when i passed forward i was fine i don't know what the harms are doing there but i'm on a horse i think that's your problems i was fine and normally i reverse one she can't reverse back the twizzy into a massive space so you want a smaller car but bigger than it would yeah i've got the northern car for you oh my god [music] watch this space you already know which one i want right david oh the yeah yeah well everyone knows i think i get it from my grandma yeah not my mom i missed a few questions no we're down down when you want the blue one person has to be in charge and it's for me no absolutely how can you tell how many people the family see it's gone down slightly since you turned up oh has it all right okay fair enough so we've got 132 people 129 now i don't know 132 there concurrent bottom left oh right okay that's two cookie reviewers i'm not sure which one these are we gonna say one's three out so well what should we address so we do the heat pump question first or should we address the uh viewership dropping i mean you did say that you were going to get something out earlier to make people watch the i can't remember if you were probably dropping because we're not talking about cars as much are answering as many questions as you were say but i can't see the questions all right i just want to get all the questions now all right watch all right so we'll start with mommy first since we had the heat pump so we've had september yeah have you even noticed realistically without with the exception of the rs installation have you know what i've what i've noticed is and say that the when you turn the well it's not a case of turning heating on and off the heating is just there it's a consistent level so you've got the radiators warm as opposed to piping hot or freezing that's the thing so no it makes a massive difference for me because i get warmers so anytime i go to a restaurant you can't sit near a radio can you no i absolutely so now we've got warm radius if you go into a traditional pub or nothing oh that looks lovely but stick me over the other side because i uh overall i'm not sure my verdict will be yay it is it's great to more comfortable to have it is more comfortable and also it feels it's more energy efficient because you know we're not blasting our heat when we don't need to be blasting out heat as far as the rest of the technical details okay and i don't really care no it's just that okay what's the short opinion of the people um but i do the fact that we're saving energy it's there you heard it here guys hahaha i wearing jumpers all the time so i yeah oh yeah while there i am it's the best i i rinsed my hands exactly that's not that's normally what you do hey of course i wash my hands hi james we're taking a long time that comment's been up there for ages we'll never get there i mean 10 or 15 minutes ago so that's why it all goes when you went to the lou i asked my mum because i said oh my god you're so close to the speaker when i was opening the speaker thing here i was a microphone oh well microphone then or did you get coke over there i was opening alice's can of coke here and um on this microphone yeah that's called the pop shield and you did tell me when you got it yeah it stops you up it makes you sound better makes you sound less whiny [music] oh gosh i don't care but this is coke zero yeah but she's me she only needs water and she'll go blue tv60 premium expect you to the market i'm gonna have to go a new five-year warranty except do you think i could find second-hand uk there was one available no you won't do you're gonna have to buy one brand new from them because they'll be so you're just gonna have to do it the used one was more than the new one so you're gonna have to wait a few months but yeah and that's going to be one hell of an upgrade can you imagine going from our original leaf you remember the gray one i do that oh the very first one two that genesis gv60 [music] that was incredible that thing in germany with the the lift the car brought up to you in a lift amazing amazing evie fam twizzy or citra and amy you missed lots of questions what's happening about the coke that's why you're highlighted it so it's i've just said harry burns hi harry we're not gonna get to your question for 10 or 15 minutes so hi harry oh there you are good hannah's watched hannah's been on which you didn't answer she sent me a message because she didn't know my sister so it's been on briefly watching i don't know if she's watching now but she said she wasn't sure how to comment and then when i said alice will put a comment up for you what do you want to say oh i'm drunk now for gone oh hannah's drunk i am shocked actually i'm not shocked mum and dad are on briefly but i don't know whether they're still on now if they've gone to bed how nice um you just said this is your sister didn't you excuse me i used to live with her sister i was living with your sister when i met you i thought you know what i picked the wrong one it wasn't in university but it was too late by then i'd left and you know married you oh i'm not gonna ride sorry drinking a cheese have you ever had a cheeky victor no we used to call them vim dodgers got the alcohol added in basically it's victor with vodka and at least for me anyway i don't know if you've got different things keep it with a ventil right all right so highlight some of them question to me and my mom and me mum where'd that come from even i'm not that have you been plugged the car in from a public charger so have you you publicly charged an electric car in the last two years since we got the tesla we've had it two and a half years this will sound really bad i have plugged it in but i've plugged it in by yourself when i've been with when i've been with andy on a family trip i mean it is really really easy to do with the the tesla but the first time i tried to plug in the the leaf which i served many years ago i got no right mess because i was using the wrong charger i need to get someone to try and help me you plug the chat about charger in but pressing ccs on the screen too it wasn't working and that was six years ago seven years ago yeah i love using the car take it to work etc but when it comes to a longer journey from the charging unless i know exactly where it charges yeah no it's not it's not the actual charge of it it's getting to the charger thing because i'm not good with driving if i don't know where i'm going so if it's the case if it's going to take me off the road and off my journey and somewhere else to find this charge point then it might sound you know a bit weak but yeah i get a bit right worried so the answer to that is no in the two and a half years and 40 000 miles we've done in a test i know the easiest captain not by yourself i mean i can't join unless you're not telling me something yeah yeah i guess not oh it's not great but why doesn't evie from do more car reviews speak what's eevee fan i'm gonna say you can tell us just shot for family there we go yeah i mean you should really make it up i'm not well i'm not down with the kids anymore we do do family videos from time to time but andy doesn't generally ask us because i'm a little clueless when it comes to cars i also it's mainly to do with her yeah exactly it's a car and well i could i could do the odd group maybe if it was tell you what the next theater totally different the drama the next car we get we'll do a members only we did the dvg yeah grandma where you two can do your opinion on it and i won't say anything about the car no clues i'll just say he goes do you know is is mum did do a which went down really really well when she was in the car next to him yeah but what i was going to say was i said to him what you need to do is get me and your mom in a car don't tell us how the controls work set us in there let us try and figure out for ourselves and my god we'll probably still we could probably do that with the tesla to be fair yeah i was asking andy how come when i put the headlights on i'm always no not the headlights no let me get this right oh yeah how come when i'm trying to clean the screen you know water coming up on the screen how come when i'm trying to clean it and i push the button in on the side but you know there's this clean the screen the stock when i push the stock bit on on the side it flashes the car in front always always catches it puts the headlights on it's because i've been putting too much pressure on the start moving it forward rather than just pushing it two and a half years so every time she's been screen washing the cat thing she's flashing the guy in front or the guy on coming and i hope you didn't clean the window when there was someone waiting to pull out of the junction or something oh she's flushing me let me go right right right now david again right you read it this time oh 140 now quality of the chat has increased greatly i'm from scotland i great to see you don't stop no i do it with anybody if it was someone from wales i start talking that wouldn't i you know just don't get a start don't get me started in fact we'll say it again if anybody has joined recently are you from a different country she can take the mic out of you with if you were here a couple of

skin is so fizzy all right i mean another one that deserves thank you oh yeah okay we've done your shot the new year in the new year at least i'll buy your navy buy any leasing is very expensive right now you still there's still there's still questions coming out that aren't related to you unfortunate you know that i would i would buy pcp is cheaper than leasing at the moment a lot cheaper because of the residual costs so it might cost you more per month but once but you will own a part of the car at the end of it and that is worth more and therefore it will work out excuse me the total cost of ownership will work out cheaper spencer said the new um well the new matilda movie oh we did wonder i did wonder about the renewed matilda movie yeah has anybody seen it no they've just they've just said oh it's good he literally just said that yeah i bet i bet that will be training oh it's just refreshed here we go what made evm want to start his own youtube pure curiosity of how it worked in the background because i work in i.t so i wanted to know how the codex worked so you you create something on any device you upload it and it just works yeah but if i create something on an iphone with going back now you couldn't watch it on another device you have to change the codex and yourself so it was just that really and it started with remember the dash cam then you discovered videos and aptitude and i thought well no that's scam so we'll try to make a comedic dash cam videos and then we've just got the leaf i thought oh i might do a about the leaf because there's a million car channels out there but it was very i think it was maybe two including fully charged that did stuff about evs so it was meant to be just basically almost a personal vlog of us with an ev but then it's ballooned into what turned into a hobby and that was literally a part-time business um so i need them completely unplanned this is completely you know never been a thing that i thought i'd ever do and you've ended up going to america i've done a lot of things a car you're going to be speaking that's fully charged are you well i'm not sure if that should be public knowledge but keep keep blathering away sorry drink no no free tongue that's not my fault down if you're watching you have 350 budget a month do you have any advice i'm presuming even for the car for a new one ev mg4 uh we'll should meet that i don't know if your reynolds always too small 500e too small maybe but mg4 probably would fit that i imagine no yeah guys new year to fuba we said it's yours now yeah that's a problem sometimes you can't understand what people are saying because we've forgotten the conversation was your same if the girls could do what you were saying if the girls could pick one thing what would they change about electric cast the charging that would make it a little to charge i'm pretty sure what's happening just just wait a minute unless it's the unless it's the tesla where they've got their own charge points with a public one having to get onto the app etc it's still a lot harder isn't it and getting more charge points in different areas for example robin hood's bay where i go to quite a bit with that was nothing there my mum and dad the whitby's got yeah it's so special it's hardly hardly anything in terms of charging opportunities so bring more my charging points will be my my thing okay uh ev in manchester right manchester the ev um person man city or man united i know you'll get a comment back from here matilda movie is very good by the way i'm not interested in that so we're gonna skip that one cat will you oh well we've already said that a bit anyway that must be somebody else saying number two minutes sorry stop moving all right okay do you think the chinese will dominate the eb car market in the same way as the japanese did in the 70s they were big inroads uh i will say dominate because i think people do the comfort of a volkswagen and so forth but there will be a big market share so it depends what you considered dominoes what are you going i'm getting a chocolate why don't you just dance i could have just pass you the box okay okay so uh dominate well who's to say but no i think the european manufacturers will have to respond don't make any more noise it's not going to pick it up if you want a speaker at all a problem with getting the food bullet trip now we've got bullet train wow that's going to be very long we'll have to watch that i finally watched paddington 2 this year that's brilliant basically not to buy something now let's watch that recently oh that's absolutely absolutely hilarious the scene in the prison you're talking about me by the way it doesn't get any easy until they get a job you're old enough stood up so prepared one no we'll not get easier with ebk but you cannot go well it happened what you could not go well camping with no phone signal or able to charge phone well you can charge your phone in a cat and most of scotland does have a phone signal doesn't it in fact me and harry were in scotland uh i know a year or two back and he did a test on his phone and got i think it was 350 or 400 meg must have been in sort of 5g trial area it was it's the fastest connection you've ever seen in the middle of the highlands uh hey i just sit there i thought was the election and then russell says it happened the long term as it gets you when you're not actually talking to alexa you haven't even said i'm going to turn off the uh the speakers and she says something in the background all of a sudden the room words that you can use alexa shut up i'm gonna be talking to you yeah i'm in the middle of a conversation with somebody else and you're just randomly interviewing right for us was relaxed so it's just that's a bit rude what are we looking at now i'm seen if there's anything we can oh well i'll i'll set up for the people's works as letter i'll leave it yeah that works okay so that's starting to tell me how to because you didn't have spotify [laughter] new year from aylesford kent happy new year to you too tasmania australia australia all right you see you did it first aren't you

little of what i do on an everyday basically they know the little things i come out with well this is what the would look imagine this is on mummy's right now right guys hello is this on oh no what's happening you've lost the what's up we've gone and we're back i don't know what happened there oh the microphone pressed f1 oh what you're gonna knock your glass off the table off the desk right so i'm gonna happen thank you very much love you dave as well just finished work don't know what i'm watching okay fair enough what i can't wait to watch it either i couldn't toss it's pronounced oh that was the thing that i was trying to pronounce arkintosh thank you donald foreign [music] oh no there is no microwave it was me meaning to say microphone and it came out as microwave that's one of the lonerisms you know i think i'm gonna say one thing and then it comes out yeah well i do sometimes but no yes i quite roughly it's downstairs when we were watching strictly and i said oh ten's giving his first craig and i meant to say greg's giving this first ten yeah wait we love it when did you lost public charger to non-tesla site three weeks ago actually wow fast charging what what's that i was when you pick me up from school uh-huh but yes she's getting uh increasingly busier thank you sally that's very nice lush that means i'm sweet how do you know i'm not done with this missed out that coming because he didn't want the others to hear it i don't know what it means she's lush she's sweet she's nice you know he's perving on you that's a blip okay see and you said it wouldn't have an effect on your subscribers rubbish can i have dairy milk chocolate dearest i'll take this below okay where are we now on a whisper getting crowded out there happy new years from adelaide south australia australia 34 degrees centigrade there oh my goodness it was about three here probably what feature it's eight what feature accessory do you think all evs should have vehicle to load so you can plug in anything to the car and it will power it if you camping you can oh yeah there's a few cars of it now but every car should have it because it's really easy to implement did say that if you're using something and you want to you an electricity do the barbecue off it or something that that's nice any chance you could do a on ev tariffs there's only one at the moment i'll probably do another one in a few months once the price cap expires at the end of march so there's no point doing one so close to the the price kept changing i might as well wait until after that but at the moment the of the ev tariff that's in the from uh april may junich is still relevant it's still the cheapest one tough okay so basically i want people to put in the comments what football team what's this mean what do you think you are what's this you've been watching too much of this bloody youtube nonsense okay so i want you to put in the comments what football team you support all right okay fair enough last two there's two it's man united she's just she's just she's she thank you she just used football how about we change it up a bit as well which is your favorite formula one team because you're a [ __ ] she's a big formula one drive yeah fun right fair enough do you think the british government have removed evenings [music] what do you think what have the british government removed ev incentives too soon well i do not but there's a massive lead time for most electric cars you know six months if i can get it so clearly you don't need to incentivize anyone to buy one the people with the least amount of money now can't afford them even more because they removed the grant and therefore all the prices have gone up because of the ground yeah it's a tough one what question we on it was good i think it's only you should have kept the uh grants for charges because they removed everything now there's no chance perhaps not to not put as much of a price on all the charges right if you want to charge it now it's going to cost you 600 quid amped up at home a lot of money so i would say for some things yes uh evw from blackpool area getting closer getting a little bit closer but no it's still still uh still not there still not there can we say i of course we did i mean when you were a child you lived in the same houses grew up in the same house without saying doesn't it no i

looking them it's it's an hour and a half from leeds to to london i meeting people on the train it's good fun i mean i go down to wales don't i just see my friend and it's seven hours or so with a few it's just a shame about all the the things that go on the strike it does make it a lot more awkward yeah i the train very close really getting closer it's not preston so i might as well say now no

in the new year now is that yeah i think it is person to call in the new year and enjoy the celebration so as that countdown ticks away actually i think that the iplayer streams are a couple of minutes delayed so i think we have actually already passed it okay i'll turn it off okay i mean that 2023 was well into the future really wasn't it when you were yeah bear in mind back to the future it went into 2015 he went forward in time to 2015. oh my god yeah well i've realized i've known my best friend for 30 years and that's just a sobering film which one fee no i'm one of my best friends

take him a microphones over there oh speakers you call it essentially we're going to try and do the webcam where he's there and i'm here so we'll have to physically meet up for a few hours every week to get it recorded um so we're going to try but given the fact that we have very little time it owns no money at all and probably never will it's the first thing that had to go so yes we are seriously planner on bringing it back as soon as we can in january hopefully so yes it will come back how can anyone from yorkshire spot man united my dad's from manchester and i made it so charlie you're from

we'll see whether people actually want to stay loosely uh the best uh so yeah they have a lawn in scotland to buy an eevee of an interest-free lunch which i always thought was a brilliant idea clarin for the f1 team i nars oh it's not your favorite team though is it no did evg get into f1 because of netflix seems the netflix f1 stuff is interested no no in fact you got into f1 because of evg because of grammar yeah yeah she's a big f1 fan not yet no ev team we're good whoa right that's very good can you tell everybody i'm gonna tell everybody no i thought you said where no no i didn't i

for the family it's time to bad day to the comment mrs wanted a smooch does he just he's misses know that he's been hitting on you essentially no he's not he's already told me his comment was about the fact yeah that's why it liked about it [laughter] yeah sadly that's not the case really happens are you from blackburn well the wigan bit was living was closer leads think about the wigan think about the letter what it starts with no no oh yeah i love whitby well especially robin is bay near whitby we've got the werewolf no not the window not witness daniel's got it it is warrington i think you don't you don't talk proper what i do is that right yeah that's what you think at the time to answer the phone no i'll just put it on mute how how rude mummy not putting him falling on mute with all a decline in viewership watching this party before and we appeared oh we got any more questions for him and let anybody wants to ask me oh it's the end of the questions yeah yeah wow we're going on fireworks right now we did that what planet was andy born on before coming to earth david all right did we yorkshire is its own place you need a planet to get a planet passports right does everybody know where we were well you've already i thought we'd said but first one put it in the chat wins the high five what's the high five i think we talked about yorkshire the missus didn't think he was after he read all in fact i got in the bad books for saying she liked to drink you know a drink just not an alcoholic yeah oh no i don't mind well yeah and i don't even mind drinking drinks you won't drink that often you would drink more probably if it wasn't so dangerous this is what she's when she saw but what do you think she's when she's drunk yeah one of the first times i met you got drunk remember and you tried to ride that ride a bike in the hallway this is at union near the doorway she can't ride a bike she sat on a bike leaning up against the wall and went oh it was leaning up against the wall you fell off the bike it was lean in the hallway trying to take it out the door though wasn't it you were facing the wrong way yeah it doesn't happen i think i could probably count on now we're not from staton stop watching it why is he doing this sounds world war ii what does that mean i'm just getting rid of the mega string what's going on someone's a spam boxes uh it's posting rubbish on the stream deleted it okay what city do you live in now well i'm not going to sell exactly where were they but we'll live in a small village near skipton yes essentially we're not living a city yeah lots of new york box yeah he's gone 69mega.com i mean does anybody actually go to these links that people put these bars i don't understand why they still do but quite frankly what does um i appreciate that some that some people will feel they haven't got enough money they're not getting enough pay through everything's going up so much isn't it so it's bound to have an effect in some cases they want to strike to try and make a statement i just think it's a shame about the effects or people in the process but it's clearly not time for a serious conversation but yeah you know ambulance strikes and stuff that's really worrying yeah no with the police uh obviously the police officers they didn't really get the the option unfortunately the police regardless but it does seem to be happening across all sorts now royal mail ambulance trains makes you wonder what's next in terms of protesting whether it's gonna be shop shop stuff whether we're going to close supermarkets for money's gonna go off in five minutes no it's not uh so yes but spamming just take you to sites to get your credit card info to run yeah you go somewhere and it says oh but i didn't i didn't see what it was but you ran i thought it was some in an offensive comment goals you've been trying to delay it says 69mega.com stop watching the stream find love right five times yeah it's when you get the email through from a site that you can't pronounce you think yeah i'll delete that one or it says so and so wants to meet you she's a really nice person boop well after it was actually a really nice person which might be a really nice person this person emailing me thank you you really enjoyed the live stream kevin that's great i'm glad you've enjoyed it not really responsible for most of it because obviously it's been at least for the majority of it and we've just appeared for part of it haven't we right who preferred it when we came on the live stream alibaba i was enlightened to find out not all the strikes were about the money per se working conditions means stuff levels are so tight they won't approve people's holiday time ah right well obviously it's important to know about a bunch of factors really so yeah it's obviously affecting people wanting time off yes it's a little bit when we're at work and they're saying oh there aren't enough stuff in the room so you can't finish earlier oh you can't have your leave yeah it does they have to tighten things it's true you can buy an ev charger from amazon let's have a look from amazon which can you bang that a bit harder i don't think it goes through the microphone you're all drunk no she's not drunk here all right so i could buy a charger a wild box here 36. i can't see any installation still on at the minute by the way are you still watching they're watching i can't say have you got a link to the ev chat for amazon that says they'll install it for you i'm curious uh oh this guy's uh australia hot and sunny in christmas new year's eve news out is not drink will this year she'll be doing this tomorrow we're going out you do cook occasions no one's having to do it tomorrow she makes some delicious cupcakes gorgeous is we are expecting white board of truth content got soil and battery this year i think it does work will it make sense i think i was thinking it if it makes sense it should have a lot of fireworks going on uh it um raining yeah it does make sense fine actually it definitely does expecting we're expecting the whiteboard to be getting a name this year what i'm going to give you a whiteboard a name it's a whiteboarded coupe donald i don't know if it did you shouldn't have a name stick with that i mean mysterious um it's just a whiteboard of truth you know that i think i think so well if you say something on youtube then people believe it so if you call it the whiteboard of truth then you can't lie let you think to be right uh is the fat modern tesla still entertaining it up you know i put it on for someone who'd never been in it about a week and a half ago and we were giggling away so yes it still is because it's busy farting is funny yeah but you leave it on for ages and then it's just it's not when you indicate it's not funny i know it's just not funny anymore it's all right for a couple of minutes and then it just gets annoying i'm sorry farting timed correctly the noise is amusing and i would to uh test that theory all right what are you going to start doing fast now well if my production skills are any good we'll see whether it goes down to 80 or up to 140. there we go oh my gosh we've gone through a whole box right are you ready so if i just turn this volume up here i think that this is amusing [applause] oh yeah this is clearly where our camera differs right direction [music] i'm sorry but there was nothing wrong with well-tatting fat okay i've been proven wrong we're at 113 and we're at 100. before 20 increase some viewers when you start farting oh god okay right where are we all right yeah we were up to that david at the top all right so was there love the oh there we go i haven't opened the up in almost 10 months of ownership that's the tesla wrap well i use it quite a bit for the preview oh yeah i do the tesla i must admit when i'm in work i can put the what where's my cracker talk about taking the family abroad for a holiday road trip with planned it several times and covered got into it didn't it yeah oh we were going to do nowhere [music] i'd still to go to norway at some point yeah we were going to drive through various countries to get there and then a week or so there and we bought a time grandma's here yeah we booked it yeah oh my gosh they're still there wow i'm amazed 117. hi grandma evm should get into the 21st century and use a spreadsheet of truth you can't interact with online that's that's why i have that point that things i can circle stuff you can't do that with an on-screen image that's why the white model truth will never seem to really enjoy using that in it and to be honest it's a lot easier to work with farting is the only thing minions do you just watch the minions film you have to be long then that's even funnier exactly maybe with somebody who farts on yourself what you do you do it i i make an audible warning to everybody it's going you know everybody knows that there's a smell anyway what you do if we're in bed all you get is the the duvet just does that and i'm what's that noise bloated with your crisps all over sorry i get that right sign the book dev it doesn't come close does it to get off the frequency is in your department but yeah yeah but at least i give an audible warning to people first you just goes that with a cover and then foreign on that spotify playlist so i'm not sure yeah but the long ones are there yeah you've got ebg yeah i've just started on a 940 million kilometer journey wow 940 million kilometers are you going to space um are you sure you got that right no no what's that in mind distance to moon and kilometers distance 384 000 beyond doing 940 million that's a long way and that's saturn or something epic journey allow six hours swapsby famous evg is here upper class has arrived uh well yeah see grandma you'll have to come up every time i get a press car so you can do it it's a members only you never you never commented edna assuming you were watching at the time but what do you think about me and you being put in a car just gonna figure out what we're doing with it what's the most complicate i mean the test is probably not far off but you're familiar with it to the point um there's a public flight guy on youtube run two people on the street shouting move called brown you see people watch anything with that i don't mind them for a bit i just then find it fighting is funny something wrong if you don't find it from there you can interact with the spreadsheet if you have some form of touching but the camera won't pick up on the screen very easily i can circle space it's just a lot easier and quicker quite frankly to do remote fat is now awesome so you can get the tesla to fart with an external speaker if you had a newer version of the test oh my god you're the same thing to do is the horn and getting too far externally too is he going down the street i've seen that it shows at a new level see 110 . we weren't at this level when there was just me just just saying just saying oh it's hitting um probably my lemon it's 11. yep 940 kilometers is a lap around the sun yeah i've been i haven't been sensible this year and there's been a hell of a lot less uh donations thank god oh yeah is that what you said can't write on a spreadsheet screen capture you can't point to something that big i don't know how you're going to be able to settle tonight it's cooked zero okay yeah okay right i'm sure the heroes you've not got a problem with but the 2-0 uh grandma evg's game if you are yep martin from england pointing the camera at the screen that's it that's it screen capture just doesn't work because how do i interact with a screen capture now pointing at something and i can it's the screen capture that's the whole point plus it takes a lot more than post editing than just pointing at a whiteboard quite frankly and you can't have a spreadsheet time for some shots um sorry james we only do shots for certain basically done it and we'll and they'll do a shot no you don't have to donate anymore no don't don't do it you can if you want but don't if i do not other than the fate of the tesla what else is coming up this year well there's a few videos that amped up the army and the volvo c40 that have been edited already there'll be obviously a winter heat pump no no when bra comes off you counter goes ballistic exactly right now i think we need to put that to the test really so do you think it'll go up if you i'm not saying take your top off we've gone down people people won't have a clue that is happening and why would they even think about logging in i'm always fascinated how a woman could take the brown off without taking the top off it's oh it's easy it's witchcraft so you can't cut the thing at the back let me do the straps and then you just to be fair it's really good feeling any woman would agree as well anyway i was not talking about the uh the videos coming up and winter heat pump statistic and costs have gotta wait until the heat pump's finished for that one i've got a that i've already done coming over here because i bought an infrared camera uh you know a heat dbg joby thingy uh what else what else i'm usually just make it up on the flies i go along to be honest but uh car reviews when they turn up that was happening obviously we've got the tesla campaign a good for you something i mean yeah yeah [music] i i did that do you think you've all eaten more food than i've read today yeah probably maybe some night to eat his and hers yeah i liked it i'm just sitting watching crackers and crisps and whatever else not to mention what we had earlier yeah there we go i'll put this in then if you want to just spill the bit i must smell it yeah i'm going to put martin in for mommy i'm watching with the wife you want a shot of water for you no that's fine if it does come off the top stay now don't worry about that where is the dog or cat well cats we don't have a dog no we don't have a dog cat's probably outside no we'll go home in the garage the garage give us a second we'll be um i'm trying to say are you getting homer honor if i go with you so i knew the garage it's all right actually about your house we'll go in a minute then well we'll go in a minute is the family going to be in the member live stream maybe probably not it says is the fam is the family going to be in the member live stream it's on the trailer to answer questions people have asked rather than something this if you want us to be in you can always ask for us and maybe no no for 20 minutes it's not this every month it's literally for members just to answer ask questions because i can't take there's too way too many emails for me to go through it's an opportunity to give people a chance to speak to you on this well no problem members yeah yeah well if you get 50 emails and then you're asking advice it's not going to happen that'd be literally a job with a full-time job for someone so this is the first way i can do it i mean if we don't work we'll just stop doing it but it won't be this and certainly won't be this okay um david you're not helping you just see the garage has the man with the long knife and mask in it so um i'm watching with the wife taking bra off is not advisable will you oh yeah it is totally great and i'm sure if you're watching with the wife you're telling me that they don't have a real sense of complete relief and satisfaction when you just go that's what we're talking about and he hasn't got the restrictions anymore but i've been pulled away right best feeling pulling away before she digs herself into a deeper hole [music] there's other feelings that are better all right we'll be back guys welcome to my life foreign i don't know i don't know how long should we carry on what should we uh what should we do what should we should we stop should we carry on should we should we come off i don't know we're past the new year's eve any more questions oh christ has been another donation i'll come to you in a second i have to wait for them to come back um i don't know if i'll go for a another shot or not but i can try oh dear walking downstairs is not advisable when you run a little bit to drink as soon as i stand up it just goes today you got stuff all over the chair i've got to that kind of tired i feel slightly woozy okay his tire is slightly woozies it's turps y can i smell it no because it's not very nice yeah there we go you'd have to do it i'm not pressuring anybody into drinking sorry let me move the chair oh is he yeah if you drink both your cups oh hang on oh it stinks yeah the cat who is that is that have you farted after all the things we've been talking about and homer's the one that's coming in five well he's made his presence known straight away he's gonna bring the viewers record down that's the question [music] right next question where is the dog our cat i was here right now oh yeah we've gone past the farm going yeah an arthritic cat let me do it okay all right i would be interested in trying out an american suv if they bring it over here give me one i'll try anything to be honest unnecessarily large typically but yes for uk road so it can be interesting yeah you just did that to me yeah best to leave your undergarments on your misses might not be impressed that's all that's to neil oh right okay garage has the man with the long knife and masking it yeah i know i've already been it's an integral garage it's part of the house it's not it's going outside or anything is it home i mean you sleep in their job right oh yeah it's fine i he literally farted though well we disturbed him setting up a discard what also work for feedback descriptions regarding the podcast i've thought about that i just don't really know how it works to be honest a discard it's a chat i know what this goal is i'll give it to you then set up with a discard for me i'll talk to her harry but yeah possibly um i guess but this is one more thing to run and keep an eye on so um e-golf is a great car and has better interior in the 93 i would agree if it wasn't for the range i would prefer a golf that's electric than an id3 uh yeah although the new golf's interior isn't that much better oh mr tim lucha ten dollars i'm gonna finish this do you want some malibu i just had a sip of water this is water right yeah that is water i presume it is water i love it you should not want to honestly you can have a sip wait a minute call that sick you're not a yorkshire that's a lemonade good see alcohol is very very bad until you turn 18 then it's very very good all right next nothing at university and i've no idea how because i couldn't come close to doing it now mommy yeah is that all malibu quite yeah you're gonna down that no no no no no no no no i'm not gonna go fast the ironic thing is the fizziness of the lemonade that's a bit of that is probably gonna have a worse effect on you than the alcohol yeah [laughter] a fog on when she gets out there stop i don't have to go in a bit i've already been month have you done yours another shot fizziness is the problem parmesan lemonade probably shot 11. shot of lemonade yeah probably shot lemonade hold on a minute where's that where are them chilies and get you some chilies to sit here no thanks uh thank you mr lucha is that right yes cute i would do a frequent asked questions to link from the live stream which they have a lot of repetition with a lot of the questions it's related to okay that changes kind of every month or two you know prices change cars change but again it's just the end of the website to create a lot of work um but yeah thinking about all possible options the party is finished happy new year from algeria hmm it looks kind of odd because you can't see him i get you [music] beautiful bringing bats into it and you're around about what are you doing i just think i've ever seen homework so we'll see some stroking hormones okay [ __ ] my cat i'm stuck i'm deposited right now oh my god okay pringles happy new year there's hardly anything left how's your heat pump holding up perfectly fine throughout the coldest uh freezing uh winter will perfectly fine with it you'll pick up remarkably sauce yeah thing is the first year it did it it was people just got silly on the donations and i wasn't i was wasted it's absolutely absolutely exploded because i mean i've been i've been drinking a bit but god by the end of the night if you'd have seen it in here it was he was coming tiny bit amount of vodka left in and then okay and alice were still in here and there was a few of them after we'd gone out to the lou nearly took a hole of the bookcase down in the that was in the office at the time we were going no yeah it was it was probably funnier for people that's why africa people probably wanted to watch it again because you can see the car crashes but i mean i've been too sensible this time it may not be plus the fact i think people really enjoyed it the first year because it was covered it was stuck in lockdown there were a lot of people stuck at all and i think you know just appreciated just the human contact between us the banality of it and just i thought you know the enjoyment it was 2019 yeah last year you were working so it's just lost two so you couldn't yeah that was different i think you saw me briefly i was eating them usually at work there you go bra off when you get home is the best feeling after a day off work i've been saying that to you for ages you know what i mean the best feeling i get when you get when i get off from work and the bra comes off if you didn't up because evw slacked last year continues to do double shots this year andy works hard here richie well we'll just say he hasn't drank as much what excuse is that did have an excuse to be fair i am still living alone kitty have a new year's bubble gums uh you know he did have a bit of cream from the triple didn't it tiny bit yeah and you put the little the yogurt pot down from the triform so you go sit background again home it's fine stink did you ever find solutions do you have a fun solution to home sleeping on the tt yes i got a car cover and it's now sleeping on the car cover on top of the tt it was literally every time we went to the garage when i came back from work he was always on on top of the car and as soon as i try and change how did i know about that within five minutes again uh what is your favorite color for a cat is that me they're asking well in general i guess i a white car i do i mean we've got two white cars at the minute it is a really nice silver to have i mean i a dark blue pearl as well a midnight blue car it's a black yellow car on the right side when it's perfectly clean a black card yeah but the black cards are really hard to clean i quite uh white car's very smart career well that's a bit the leaf we we oh baby baby oh yes yes that's when she had a bit of beer because b is evil don't start drinking it will make you very old fast that's obviously why i look younger i'm not gonna say how old i told everyone earlier that um is cheap because i'm in the fallout yeah i watched that bit i was no you watched some of it so i'm 25. i think realistically they'll probably i was watching probably the same five yeah my wife pulled the same face happy new year suv guy wants to start yeah she don't guinness oh right yeah yeah what is it about would i be correcting this human that ladies prefer shops well as in you know malibu and cuff and that sort of thing whereas no blocks tend to put pints of things plenty of friends who will go out and have a i'm not saying they've been warned up though yeah it's just me i i prefer um smelly dog this year hopefully it won't terrorize my next door is having a dog's having a baby can't go on holiday without making provisions actually 200 people need to donate five pounds see how drunk we can get him yes yes that's why i always been my girl this year i mean i think genuinely think last well the first year anyway uh yeah you must have been at least 30 donations or something that and he wasn't a shop for each one incredible how much money went to the i think what happened is people saw how drunk i was getting and thought this is funny boom but what i'm wondering is how long are people actually going to stay tuned in well maybe we should just come off in the next five ten minutes because he's getting late yeah well it's 22 why don't we say one o'clock 20 minutes because we've got still 90 odd people who are watching but clearly it's not going to be us so as interesting now maybe is it as it was before hmm too much of a good thing that's true you don't drink wine yeah we don't we don't drink wine no women a prosecco [music] even even the name sounds off you haven't finished this yeah if you stay on and someone will still be at 70 yeah probably probably so but i don't think it'd be you know can i trust you to do something oh god it depends what put the thing that is n't daddy's glass yeah i didn't know that exactly it's a dribble oh well there we go yay you want something yeah fantastic put lemonade in it i will next time bedtime is creeping up the kettle is empty it's interesting spelling there he's have you been drinking as well um empty some other thing the people can what would be funny to watch other than someone getting drunk well i only said we're gonna be on for another 20 minutes no i'm going about for the next years how could we change this before we decide how can we change this up that would what would you to see on netflix people just watching people getting injured get a drunk fall off fall over when you watch jump people doing weird stuff on instagram yeah it's quite funny dunk people doing things against you there's nothing funny watching a drunk person walking up steps and then falling back down again any plans for tax deductible summer business road chips every long trip i do i plan on doing some sort of for it so then it's tax deductible yeah i'm even thinking about redoing the garage so refurbishing it immediately a little bit oh yeah so i can get a little out of it and then put that in the outgoing column i'm thinking what else can i do with this that goes in the tax out part of it see if we have all three of us on earlier so neil's basically saying i would have the ev family on earlier that's why i was saying especially is a lot of the questions will be covered in the monthly live streams so yeah this is something you're introducing the monthly live streams this year we need something to do though maybe otherwise i said you go through the other hours you go through the same questions what we could do i don't know questions or something i don't know a quiz okay do some cooking we do some bingo maybe maybe in fact next year we can't well because i'm working you're working next new year's eve yeah oh yeah it could change again i mean you'll be 13 by then so that means i can leave you to it and i'll just get you know do what i want money time for cooking some bacon eggs now oh wow i tell you what christmas morning every is what is it alice what's wrong no more chocolate look at that pile every couple of months we do pancakes for breakfast and we do them as in the crepes as well great big crepes flat crepes but at christmas we do the canadian pancakes with maple syrup with yours and bacon and chopped up banana and oh absolutely delicious i don't know it takes a little bit i could eat a fried egg and bacon sandwich right now yeah [music] next year mooring i think breakfast uh are you having to pay high gas prices now going to no the price cap means that it's 10p for 10.4 pence per kilowatt hour for gas for everybody and we have a heat pump so we don't really use any gas um have you would you consider ripple uh that's a wind farming no because it's not a great investment unless you've done absolutely everything in your house once you've done everything in your house then maybe but personally if i've got a few two or three grand spend i'd spend it on something in the house to make that more efficient then ripple because it's not protected in any way i'm not i don't think i'll go anywhere but if ripple goes bust you've lost all your money and even they're saying 17 years to get your money back according to their website so i'm not that impressed to be honest uh i haven't really looked into it that much so i should point out things you shouldn't do while jump up the whiteboard or what was it called the white board of truth the drunk whiteboard that would be interesting you missed out donald and david i know what we could do wild camping and new year's eve street stream no no okay you missed out donald and david what do you mean you know this year the wife joined for four hours of fun she agrees it's entertaining just hanging out listening to evm in the family that's me see how do i get that but why it's entertaining i would that's insulting you know i think sometimes it's true mature you don't know why but you're watching it reality tv it should be up to a tosh but it's on been on for 20 years and people still watch it oh there's a lot of that i don't want i won't particularly sit there are you watched blue strictly oh yeah big brother well i'm on about or love love island i'd rather not watching they're talking about the eggs now essentially they're in a living room watching people sat in the living room yeah so yeah yeah no evk daddy will cook it for you maybe we oh so that's an idea for next next year we'll cook whilst we're down there okay it was great move i won't be here this has been great entertainment quick question before you go so learn to gates okay so that's question to you uh gas essentially and the only thing that can change gastructurally in his uh heat pump because it's efficient as in you get a lot more heat than the electricity used if you've got solar and battery and a tariff then it's cheaper but ultimately it won't mitigate its installation costs for a long time so if you're doing something for saving money heat pump's probably not the best thing in the world but not everybody starts heap on just for that reason now i need to change new year's eve pharma i'm just reading through all the rest of the year me too what was for the award for oh that was the uh best electric film 2019 is that when we went to the pub and had a little electric vehicle festival was it we went yeah we met the food a couple for lunch does ebu not to fry an egg i'm actually quite an accomplishment he's the one who i'm very good with poached eggs you talked to me i was going to say taught me how to poach it's not bad not bad at all another department here since 8 13 the wife's back from work well nice that you've stayed faithful you've waited up for your wife is what i'm saying and now she's saying get off crap crap how to deal with mental mentally a drunk person in your previous life i'm firmly in the opinion that drunk people are less than fun especially if you have to keep others safe from drinking yeah but that's when you're too drunk that's when i don't drug people when i'm at work to be you're right there what has he just ended up i was drunk yeah they're not always the best to deal with people get drunk in different ways sometimes i feel i put ramen party i already said bye to him i went hey when you say it means high definition i almost did use that to proper camera over there expensive camera as a webcam um it's a good have been in hd roman cook yes he's already put that do you think silver the malibu basically it is an old drink it's true it's not you know oh you're having a malibu the last room i had was for that stuff we got from jamaica that was 100 proof that was the solar and pv add money to the value to the house i reckon it would make it a lot easier to sell at your asking price so technically i guess yes whether or not the estate agent will put it from what because of that um debatable i would say it should add value to a house having the uh the solar panels potentially especially i think it's having a nice a really nice kitchen is something anyone can do because you're buying the house not the things inside it but if it comes with a kitchen that you're happy with it's oh well i don't have to do that but i won't pay any extra it might make people think oh it could save on our energy bills it does but you're talking about something that'd be really expensive to install generally so if you see it's already it isn't though is it yeah but if you're buying a let's say i know 300 000 pound ounce spending eight on a battery and solar panels ain't a huge increase you could spend 30 grand on a kitchen i'll still say it'd be a selling point yeah but you know what i mean i don't think it'll increase the price of the house but i think people are more likely to pay the asking price it's more desirable yeah yeah it's having a cat that's in really good condition they're more likely to to go oh you know i'll just buy it because it's the best out of all i've seen as opposed to it's worth more so i think it'll make it easier to tell so i guess that's about using a value add yeah it's getting to the point where i'd say those additions are considered a value add depends on the value of the house yeah well kraken rum is awesome well okay never tried that but is that your take your word for it paul just don't go down the ev puzzle as general becomes one spreadsheet after another time exactly spreadsheets it's interesting to a few people but i think yours is a good variety the trouble is your whiteboards are out and about you have to play the youtube game if i did a that would feel ev puzzle it's too niche it's really interesting for a small amount of people but you'll never get the views now a lot you don't always have to chase the views but views paid the bills so you gotta find a happy medium that's got some information but also some interest for people yourself who couldn't give the monkeys about heat pumps yeah otherwise no one clicks on it and therefore you think well i've spent all the time doing that work and no one's watched it you know it's got it's what there's more people it's a fine line i don't want to know it's a fine line but essentially people don't want to see how you figured it out they just want to know the end game i don't want to know how you figured out which is cheaper i want to know which is cheaper what which is the cheapest tariff i don't care how you got there just tell me the tv story hannah did you have to log on i think too you have to sign in don't need to post very warming malibu today oh well got me malibu here it's very warm in here with the malibu as well he's gonna stop twitching soon i don't know if you yeah oh no i can't really all right alice that's comment to you what oh no it's gone apk since no one is listening to your dad how are you doing at school okay yeah i've actually did really well at school thanks [music] dave more dash cam clips i don't really i don't see them anymore unfortunately he's walking up now yeah it's probably really really okay so i think we're gonna be finishing shortly so are there any last burning questions that anyone's got before we disappear about anything yeah you got a few minutes oh actually we never tested the uh brar off thing oh yeah yeah it worked all gone brilliant see it's magic it's witchcraft i don't know how that works no no no no no no no so let's let's watch the concurrent viewers it's gone down by one ah disappointed [music] what are you wishing it was i'm listening mate don't worry new year's resolutions resolutions that's not something you know i don't [music] i don't close the pressure oh you don't talk about it no no he's getting the podcast back i think i think that'd be a good resolution um are you talking to me david it's going up by yeah the bar experiment's not working all eyes go to view numbers it's gone up just something else right fair enough [music] yeah yeah um what are you looking at it it's going to try and get try and get more chips in i think more um more breaks away be good i know we're not gonna get to it no way had time again all right all right i want to see norman ma [music] well you've made a two-person difference to concurrent viewers when you took your brother off sorry person well to be fair it's nothing miraculous it's just something that we women appreciate being able to do we appreciate it as well yeah well you don't get that much more i don't think the experiment has proven that he's got any extra views did you really think it was going to do to be honest i mean since we're at the point of logging off anyway maybe you could put it in the title or something that man thank heavens with a brother and own boobs on youtube that's norman oh the briar is a wonderful invention you're right that was really good helps defy gravity a bit longer never thought i'd get i'd get a discussion this on an ev oh you can discuss all sorts done that's funniest farts since daddy's drunk seeing you do a handstand should be funny seeing him do a handstand even if he was sober will be funny david's world cup all right you talk about my dad right i'm gonna try to do a handstand no no no no no no no without a bra hand stunned boiling [laughter] uh i won't be both fully charged mr harrogate one because it's you know 40 minutes away 30 minutes 40 minutes we're supposed to having to stay overnight so it's two days and an accommodation for essentially the same show so you know but just to have a good one i feel i'm friends with alibaba and david as well now okay they've been back for the last two years three years all right okay uh last chance in fact one o'clock i'm gonna turn it off so last chance uh for questions yeah so last couple two minutes happy new year guys thanks for entertaining evening looking forward to more interesting videos next year well he's always got videos lined up i can't believe i managed to do them every week we live here all right you can always tell them you can always tell when i run out of topics because they end up doing one in this room we can just do one randomly five minute one on your phone well that's an extra i'm actually doubling the output when every tuesday and friday now but the tuesday ones are easy to film oh i think davis will's responding to you alice all right okay fair enough hey hey feeling 93. oh wait a minute we're supposed to be leaving why are you coming back it's probably because we're still on moves jeez still on bye mark saying bye bye mark bye bye have we still got simon here or is he gone now simon grandma simon people brother-in-law if your family text s it is here he's kind of propped up against the the the armrest the chair the chair sir yes how long are members q a sessions for uh i haven't really decided really but i'm gonna try and limit it to an hour but it members only stream right have 10 people on it so it might last 20 minutes um it's literally just for me an easy way of going right well these are the questions that people have sent before these are the questions people are asking now oh else no i'm done so it's it's purely for that reason it's not one of these um otherwise it'd be for everybody not just members only and i think i think one of these is probably the best at new year's only otherwise it kind of cheapens the uh the effects oh david's world so is this the james bond movie where he strokes the cat you're on it oh no someone's done it oh evk that's what happened and have a child meaning no social life so you will hold most that wow it's really dramatic um yeah alibaba that's really really dramatic love it drink drink drink drink are we supposed to be finishing believe me the water shop you have a water shot thanks paul i'm gonna let me let me do the pop let me do the pop okay okay there we are i can't get it out oh shhh sometimes can't get it yeah i've been drinking it there we go

Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJl35aIy5pOVBHvoGgqavrdJ,3EekRRnkq6o,hey i'm zach and i'm jesse we're going to tell you how we saved hundreds of dollars on this yakima tent for the rivien next on now you know [music] we want to thank birch living for sponsoring the show birch is a premium mattress and a box company that makes mattresses and sleep products that are stylish comfortable and environmentally conscious birch makes organic non-toxic mattresses made right here in america with just four materials sourced straight from nature organic latex new zealand wool american steel springs and organic cotton i've been sleeping on my birch mattress for about a year now now have you worn in your crater yet what after a year with most of the foam mattresses i've had i've started to see this little divot where i sleep well that's where having a well-made mattress is nice the bed isn't a big slab of plastic foam it's actually designed to hold up the pocket springs are nice because they don't squeak but offer great support they also tend to hold up better than polyurethane and that's the other point all of the materials in the mattress are sustainably sourced exactly birch is certified global organic textile standard green guard gold fair trade eco institute certified wool integrity new zealand and forest stewardship council it's made sustainably and that's important to us not just sustainability for the planet but what about your own health you know that new mattress smell yeah birch doesn't have that because it's made of natural materials not off-gassing polyurethane and birch

our link birch living dot com slash now you know and you'll get 400 off your birch mattress plus two free pillows those pillows by the way are made from recycled plastic bottles so back in 2018 i ordered the rivion r1t electric pickup truck and we were so enamored by the marketing and the idea of the r1t that we also ordered the tent and the camp kitchen to match and we waited and waited to 2020 when our truck was set to arrive but there was a pandemic so we waited and waited for 2021 when our truck was really supposed to arrive but it never came so we waited a little more until one day we got an email from rivian saying your truck that you thought was gonna be eighty thousand dollars is now gonna cost a hundred thousand dollars have a nice day now i know that everyone thinks that we're bajillionaire youtubers but we're not we had been saving up all that time just to afford to keep the rivian for about a year at which point we would then sell it because we want to test every electric pickup truck there is and we don't want to have to cow tower reviews to the nice company letting us borrow their expensive truck so when the price went up to over a hundred thousand dollars we had to trim off some of our spend and the camp kitchen and tent were the first things to go but then surprise the next day rivien went back on what they said and kept the price for us reservation holders but the damage had already been done emotional damage zach and i had already canceled the tent and the kitchen and instead of just putting it back on our order we knew that all new buyers of an r1t would have to be paying the new exorbitant prices for these items if they weren't exorbitant already and we knew that the exact same tent was made and sold by yakima for seven hundred dollars less so we called up yakima to see if it would fit our rivien and we were told no it won't fit on your truck but we didn't believe them so we looked into buying it anyway and boy howdy did we save more than seven hundred dollars yeah we did a bit of shopping we found a big discount for rei members on top of the 10 off for rei members but we weren't rei members but and i'm not being paid to say this a lifetime rei membership is only thirty dollars so our final price for the rooftop tent and the membership was one thousand seven hundred eighty nine dollars and nineteen cents and we were gonna pick it up in tax free new hampshire so no taxes or delivery fee yeah if you count in the tax a rivien tent is three thousand two hundred ninety three dollars and seventy five cents so we saved 1504 dollars and 56 cents so we just had to head to the nearest rei in new hampshire which is in north conway which is only 126 miles away but would the rivien even make it let's find out all right so we have a hundred percent state of charge yeah now only 293 miles that says i thought uh 315 is what the stated range is on the website so i'm a little concerned we just got it maybe it needs to do some calculations that's what we're trying to figure this out for you so let's go for the ride and see what happens navigate to rei north conway new hampshire [music] so so when we left it said we're gonna have 169 miles in the tank what did we end up with 182 baby nice [music] so the fully charged rivians seem to have no problem trucking all the way up to new hampshire to pick up our 45 off tent but the question still remained would it fit because remember yakima told us that it wouldn't again there's only one way to find out all right so i guess let's get the tent out okay and um i think we'll put our cargo bars on maybe we'll take the tent hardware out that attaches to the cargo bars and we'll see if they line up with the holes in the bottom of the tent that sounds good let's do it oh look at that we're done all right we're camping perfect that was so easy why aren't all tents that oh this weighs a lot more than a normal tent doesn't it all right so pulling out the cargo bars i'm trying and these took two weeks to get to us so i'm keen to see how well they work that's pretty that's pretty convenient that's pretty nice all right coming down gently one two that's a completely different feeling than this one all right so the way this is gonna work is that four of these are going to be mounted to the bottom of one half of the tent because it basically folds out these should i believe yep unscrew and widen up and they should fit hopefully on here now we were told by yakima that this for whatever reason wouldn't work oh yes i think that's all we need yeah baby and then i uh come back with this guy this part at least works the worst case now is that the holes won't line up um on the bottom of the tent but we can drill holes baby drill baby drill oh no there's already a little scrape on here how'd you get that i don't know truck it's a truck dude it's a truck it's scratched the good news is the first part that we weren't sure about these fitting they do fit the second part is where these holes line up so that's our next step so what are we doing now um what we're going to do is we're going to fold the tent back look at the bottom uh there are pre-drilled holes the nice part is worst case scenario we drill our own holes we shouldn't need to because we think we need to the full width of this bar and adjustability there and adjustability this way so i see no reason why this shouldn't work let's flip it all right so we're going to be flipping up the bottom here and where are the holes i think that's the top oh never mind try it again again the other bottom okay so uh there's two different colored stickers here one the the black is for side deployment and the red is for rear because red rear side anyway it is just about 23. so right now we're very far apart so do we both come in we would both come in so 32 there so then what we would be doing is and we have that adjustment to make that yeah okay we'll give it a shot [music] so what are you doing now so now we're attaching the ladder bracket this is going to be both the ladder and the support for this end of the tent this is how you're gonna get in the tent and it's also gonna hold up this side of the tent that way it doesn't just snap off [music] so do you think the ladder's gonna hold you uh we've done it as good as we can i think it's it's all set so now you're gonna put on the rainfly thingies yeah so i'm gonna crawl in here okay moment of truth moment of truth i feel this is the part where a lot of tents end up snapped in half yeah where we have a really bad how's it feel it feels great it's pretty big so yeah that's pretty neat i'm gonna start attaching the rain fly okay huh wow that is cool leo all right so i can come in right i think so oh man putting a lot of faith in this ladder i know right i feel it's gonna snap down on my fingers this is amazing and this is not a bad uh mattress no wow yeah i'm really impressed with this tent i know look at this that is airy yeah i'm glad we got the three person yakima rivian you're lying you don't need to buy the rivien version of the tent you can buy the yakima version of the tent and stick it on the rivien it's exactly the same tent all right so it looks we can do it uh my next question is how long does it take to get this stowed wait what what well i'm pretty proud of ourselves that we didn't trust yakima or rivien and that we just went for it and we were right yeah it was uh it was quite a bit of a bet right if we were wrong i mean maybe we could put it on the ford but i just thought it was impossible that that they would be right and that it would be impossible to put this on there you know we save money by going up to tax free new hampshire we save money by driving and picking up ourselves we save money by getting an rei membership and by buying it on sale and i will say having never had one of these i can see why you'd want one yeah quick setup quick breakdown and then you're out of the wet ground you're level you're good to go and then i can't wait to just i want to go try this out on a beach you know what we're missing though what here get out of the way oh the camp kitchen that's what we need next there's a hole in my life i need a camp kitchen it's gonna have to go out the other end of the vehicle we're still waiting for the gear shuttle ah but as soon as we get that okay so there you have it our instincts were right you can't it was a script i could tell when we called yakima and he was uh what car is that for the rivian um hang on a second no it does not fit we've done a little bit of research and we saw that yeah it's movable it works right it works you don't have to drill any special holes it works um and yeah you're going to save a lot of money not only you're going to save a lot of money that's buying the expensive version of the tent you can buy a cheaper version that uses a slightly different material so if you're not going to tent out that often maybe you'd save a few hundred bucks to buy the lower versions and you might be saying but i don't live near a tax-free state well go on a map of the united states hop in your rivien for an adventure to that state and pick it up at the rei which probably is in that state yeah and i mean maybe you can find a better deal somewhere else again we're not being paid by rei to sponsor them it's just that's how it worked out worked out really really well and you will save a lot of money not having to pay for shipping but uh let's talk about the other accessory we didn't get which is the camp kitchen right it's now over six thousand dollars and what do you get again you get the shuttle the gear shuttle which is fifteen hundred dollars okay so this is a five thousand dollar kitchen it's a slide out countertop uh fold up um two burner induction thing and a bunch of plates and your tent and the sink don't forget the sink it's a sink and a coffee maker you know what i think we should do i think we should make our version of the camp kitchen and see if we can save some money there too and our budget is 5 000 uh yeah so stick around hit the button because we are going to be making a bunch of different versions of the camp kitchen for as cheaply and as better than we possibly think we can beat them we're gonna we're gonna beat them into the dirt just we did here we saved 45 on this tent yeah that's a home run in my opinion uh so yeah stick around hit the button because uh yeah we're finding even more ways to save money uh buying this very expensive truck see you next time now you know,0

first electric car sparky a tesla model x i didn't have a youtube i was just a regular guy who really cared about the planet one day soon after zach got sparky for no particular reason we just started driving we drove all the way to cape cod i remember we stopped at the sagamore bridge supercharger and it was my first experiences with supercharging in fact that is where i heard the term tesla time and we got all the way to provincetown the tip of cape cod my whole life i have lived in massachusetts and i had never been there and when we got there we figured we've gone this far might as well turn around and just keep on going when we got to another ocean we figured we've gone this far might as well just turn back keep right on going when we needed to charge we used superchargers when we needed to sleep we slept and when we had to you get it we traveled through 25 states two provinces of canada and charged at 75 superchargers that was the first time we youtubed what we did it was one of the most amazing experiences i've ever had driving without burning any fuel without any backup crew it felt it was a secret and we wanted to share that secret with the world electric vehicles work because it worked really well all 75 superchargers we pulled into from the ones in cities all the way to the one in green river utah the most remote place i've ever been to they all charged us up great yeah there was one supercharger in san francisco and i think one in oregon which were busy and there was that one in toronto which had a few stalls out of commission but aside from those we were usually able to get charged up very quickly and this was all back in 2016. it's what propelled us to do this and show everyone that this was the future and we've tried to be honest about what excited us as well as what wasn't so great now since this channel's inception we wanted to show people exactly what it was to own an ev from installing charging at home to maintenance and we wanted to show off as many different evs as possible to show our viewers options when we were a small that involved asking to borrow friends cars or showing off my used nissan leaf that i bought but we really wanted to show you more evs so we tried reaching out to car manufacturers to borrow their vehicles and it worked we were able to borrow a review model of the volkswagen id4 however soon after we gave our honest thoughts about that we realized that our contacts started giving us the cold shoulder yeah we had crossed the line i talked to some of our youtuber friends and we learned something you're not supposed to be completely honest in your reviews if you want to keep getting review cars and i'm not here to bad mouth auto journalists or other youtubers who genuinely bust their butts to bring their audience lots of car reviews but there's only so much those people can say in their reviews if they want to keep their jobs and to their credit many of them do a great job of balancing the good with the bad but zach and i aren't this we can't overlook or downplay problems when we see them we pretty much always say what we think and it's this honesty that makes it very hard for us to be car reviewers so we came up with a different plan we would save up and buy cars outright it's way more expensive than getting a free review model we'd probably get our cars way after the other reviewers and we'd not make a lot of friends but it was the only way we could continue to put out honest reviews with vehicles that we could use for longer than a week which brings us to the r1t we've had it since april and since then we've driven 2500 miles on it and we've shown you what it can do we showed you with e-bikes on it yeah with the yakima skyrise tent we filled it with lumber we've picked up and moved tables and furniture we've tested its towing capacity with our buddy tom we've even shown you what kind of power tools both pneumatic and electric can be powered by it and we haven't pulled any punches and we can do that because it's our truck on this episode we want to show you how it handles an adventure because after all it is a self-proclaimed adventure vehicle so in the spirit of our first trip with sparky back in 2016 i wanted to go back to cape cod but this time take advantage of all the awesome stuff the rivian could do we'd bring the skyrise tent e-bikes on the hitch-mounted bike rack and our brand new beta version one camp kitchen that we made so we picked a beautiful campsite at north of the highlands camping area that's not a sponsorship they were just really nice we loaded up the truck with more than everything we needed and we set off for the coast we made it about five miles before there was a problem so we just started our trip and um it's been saying calculating root for 10 minutes so we thought well that's not good so we ended the route and then we said let's search for a new route and it automatically picks the place where we're going without me having chosen it and then it goes back to this circle of death on calculating root i guess we have to restart the computer how do you restart the computer on a rivien um i don't remember i guess i'll look that up all right so i found out how to reset the riving computer okay uh let's see hold the far left button on the steering wheel and the emergency flasher button for about 15 seconds the entire computer will restart according to rivian support do not reset again for at least one hour after this procedure there are multiple systems that may take a bit longer to fully come up after this reset but wait just to say for an hour for an hour uh i mean we don't have any root data i don't know where i'm going uh you know there's another way i just looked up that you could reboot just the mcu oh okay good um it's kind of on a tesla it's the far left button in the far right button at the same time um but again it says don't do it while you're driving we're on a trip yeah i don't want to stop just because the the navigation system isn't working i mean yeah look at it it's still doing this uh calculator where are we going where are we going okay here we go one two three four keep holding both buttons display restarting soon that's nice that it tells me sound system restarting starting both screens have shut off i'm glad we did this in a parking lot um i'm gonna push it i'm just gonna put it in reverse yeah oh deal draw it drive still drive so that's good the rivian logo is back on the screen yeah not a bad restarting screen this is a little wonky looking and that's a little wonky looking but i mean i'm not mad at that it's restarting all right so i'm going to give this a second to just settle itself out i think because it doesn't see where we are no thanks thanks around 495. that's interesting wow so the gps hasn't really connected yet gps seems to be finding us good there we are okay so now i'm gonna think that's enough time yeah hit search see if we can head there yeah battery calculation unavailable i don't love that um but sure our system is temporarily offline and can't determine if destination is in range well we know that we're gonna have to stop somewhere so we'll just start better than sitting here for an hour while it tries to think hmm high fidelity there we go oh wow this back when this is being built all right well back on the road yeah we needed to pull off the road to restart the computer to get the nav working now i still think that this could have been done while we were driving but i wasn't going to risk smashing our truck and endangering people on the highway to try it yeah and i think most responsible owners would have done the same thing it was pretty annoying that the rivian didn't just work but whatever it was just a few minutes and then we were back on our way next we tried to find a fast charging station we had enough range to get all the way to the campsite but we knew we'd be using some extra range to power the camp kitchen and to power up the e-bikes at the campsite and we had to get back home after two days of camping so the more range we could arrive with the better we knew that there were some ccs fast chargers on the way and we had a plan of stopping at the electrify america station in plymouth massachusetts but when we got there uh jesse what are we doing at a gas station um this is where the charger is let's see oh okay station charger um nice icing right over there icing on the cake it's very good one of the stalls was in use another was iced and the last two weren't working charging start error we were unable to initiate your plug and charge session we are unable to start your charge check that you are at the correct charger and your vehicle is plugged in we spent a total of 45 minutes moving the truck between chargers calling customer support having them restart stations plugging in and unplugging the truck completely unsuccessfully and then finally being told that we needed to restart our rivian something that we had to read the manual to figure out how to do 45 minutes sitting in the baking sun looking a couple of idiots at a gas station it was insanely frustrating that 45 minutes by the way that that wasn't us charging that was us not charging right um when we finally got it working the station would only give us 54 kilowatts so we had to sit there for another hour which didn't allow us to get to the high state of charge that we wanted we wanted to actually just charge up to almost full so that we'd have plenty of charge at the campsite but we were watching the day go by sitting at this gas station and we decided you know what we can make it let's just get there and we'll worry about getting home after the fact right because daylight was burning so i mean who deserves the blame at this point in the trip i mean was it rivien's fault was it electrify america's fault i think it's a bit of both i mean first of all we pulled in this electrify america station not the best location because it was consistently being iced as we were there people were just pulling in stopping going to the bathroom and then leaving which you know okay you're only there for a few minutes but still not cool it's not a great location and no good signage from electrify america telling people not to do that exactly so i don't kind of even blame them exactly then basically uh two or three of the stalls there weren't working i think it might have been all four because we did see other people pull in they plugged in they walked off then they came back and i saw them they would unplug it plug it back in right they were frustrated and then they were whatever and then they left right um that was a volvo and an ionic five right so it's not we were just seeing a bunch of rivians have problems there we didn't see any other rivens but other cars were having problems and then lastly when we talked to the guy at electrify america for 45 minutes we got to know him pretty well he said that rivens had been having trouble charging for the past two weeks and that coincided with an update we had gotten about two weeks previous right and so we had to restart the truck of course we did all of this restarting the truck 38 minutes into the 45 minutes that we were sitting there so that was fun we restarted the truck it started to charge and then we were only getting 54 kilowatts we should have been we were at a station that could pump in 350 50. the rivian can't take that much but it can take way more than 50 kilowatts yeah i mean we've gotten reports that it can take up to 212 kilowatts which would have been great and i mean a few weeks before we had had a great charging session at an electrify america station up in manchester new hampshire we pulled in over 150 kilowatts and we were in and out in 20 minutes and that's great but we've had so much trouble at non-tesla fast charging stations all around here in some of the cars we've reviewed and all over europe on my road trip there and i have to be honest with you it's not good and of course this is only based on our experiences but i gotta be honest i have a really hard time believing people when they tell me that they've never had a problem charging at these non-tesla charging stations but with that very frustrating experience out of the way we continued on our journey only an hour and a half late we got to the campsite with about 182 miles of range not as much as we wanted but we couldn't stand to sit at the charger for any longer it was a beautiful early june day on the cape we set up the tent we went for an awesome e-bike ride sorry we didn't get any footage but we blew through a lot more camera battery at the charger than we were expecting and now for the juxtaposition my lovely girlfriend was meeting us down on the cape and so she was going to drive down in my model 3. can you see the difference here there are way more superchargers and little hints they all work so i didn't for one moment worry that a charger would slow her down even though we just had that experience it wasn't even a thought in my mind that she wouldn't be able to make it down to my model 3 because i trust superchargers because we've been to probably over 150 superchargers and i've gone probably 300 times plus and they've always freaking work so that was the first of two nights uh it was my night to sleep in the tent so we got that all set up it was a beautiful night and i got to tell you the tent was really great i mean being up high was awesome uh you didn't have to worry about being down on the ground with i saw a raccoon the next morning and we heard some coyotes right so you're up high which feels good um it didn't feel flimsy it didn't feel you were gonna fall or that there was holes or anything it felt you were on a solid you felt you're on the ground and it was a wonderful experience to be up on the riven in a tent i do want to say though that uh two inches of foam doesn't quite cut it for me i would have loved an extra foam layer so maybe next time i go camping i'll bring a i don't know memory foam or something an inflatable mattress yeah i think foam is the way to go for me okay i'm not a big fan of air ever since i've had some inflatable mattresses uh give away in the middle of the night ah well yeah i get but it is camping it is camping this is glamping all right so then the next morning it was time to try out the camp kitchen all right so you may not know but jesse and i decided to not buy the 6700 rivian camp kitchen uh yeah they did raise the price we decided that you know all that camp kitchen has is a sink a two burner induction stove and some pots and pans and stuff and it's beautiful yep but sixty seven hundred dollars so we did was we took a piece of plywood that cost about five dollars then we took some bungee cords we took appliances that we pretty much had laying around the house and we bungeed them to it and we got an extension cord and we threw it all together and basically we got version 0.1 if you want to call it that of our camp kitchen now obviously this is just a test it doesn't look great but we wanted to see if we could actually make some meals on it so we tried it out for breakfast so jesse what are you working on i'm working on the hash browns oh we're gonna have hash browns this morning yeah so far so far good so far so good that is awesome the green cam kitchen version one so far so good all right so so far knock on wood we have not blown the breaker we're running two griddles we think it's about 1500 watts max that's what the outlet puts out i also want to talk about the fact that uh if we were to buy the camp kitchen i think it's 6 700 what did we spend on this this was a scrap piece of wood well let's say we bought it for 20 bucks okay wow um the dowel five bucks this was um i think 60. although you can get them cheaper you get way cheaper ones than now and then this one i think was a hundred bucks fish this was 20 20. yeah so i think we're up to i don't know boys add that up yeah we're coming in way under now this is version one but i will say honestly you may not have to go past version one this is awesome this went right into the gear came right out [music] yeah i mean we warmed up some muffins we made some french toast we made some hash browns it was uh it worked really well and then when we were done we cleaned it up with our sink and our water bottle thing and it yeah worked great it all stored in the gear tunnel area really well and so i think for what did it cost us um even if you bought all those appliances i think we're 125 yeah in the couple hundred dollars range of stuff and i would argue you might have everything you need in your house anyway if you want to bring along a waffle maker or a blender or a crock pot you probably already have those things exactly i mean take advantage of what you already have um don't just have more stuff that you're going to have to shove into your cabinets at home because i mean i'm willing to bet that if you dig through your kitchen you're going to find some kind of oh remember todd got us this remember that oh wow and we've never used this panini press bring the panini press you know bring the popcorn maker bring bring all all of your crap and don't even worry about you know even buying an induction stove take advantage of the stuff that you already have that is really fun i mean yeah if you really want a griddle buy a buy a little electric griddle if you really i did love the griddle i will say it was because um that's pretty much what you're gonna use camping a lot of times and so i thought it was nice you didn't have to bring an extra pan it was it was all great i will say though it's only one 110 outlet that you can use at a time so 1500 watts total and that means that for a lot of these appliances that heat things up you're not going to be able to use you know multiple ones so we had to be very careful to make sure that we knew what they were rated at and only used that much or else we would have to keep turning it back on again it yeah i mean if you were to try and make pasta where you need to boil water and then make a sauce probably can't do that at the same time exactly and that's one of my flaws here with ribbian unlike the ford f-150 lightning that's coming out with supposedly 220 volts and i think a whole lot more amps this is just 110 volts with 15 amps and that's just not enough in my opinion to run what you need on an adventure now is it better than every tesla that's ever been sold yes it is right okay i mean yeah you could oh i have a special uh inverter that i could plug onto my tesla i don't think that you're gonna be pulling anywhere close to the amount of wattage that we were pulling out of an inverter plus that would be pulling it from the 12 volt battery and i mean yeah there's some other spot that you're supposed to pull it from so that way you don't void your warranty but at this out of the box the rivian just as bought works this and the gear tunnel is great for storing it i mean there's a wonderful spot to put that because you don't have to worry about digging it out from the front or digging it out from the back of the bed let's talk about digging stuff out of places uh now we have a bike rack it's not the best bike rack it's just some bike rack that we bought one day um it's made for an suv so it folds down which is really cool because then an suv hatch can open on the pickup truck we couldn't open the tailgate right with the bike rack attached kind of a stupid thing i'm going to say that's my fault i'm not blaming the rivian for that um but with the tent on there really hard to access stuff in the bed of the truck good point and the bed's not that high it's only 18 inches high so there's really not as much stuff as you think that you can cram in there plus this bed is a small bed um and so i think a lot of us if we're not pick up truck people we think oh it's got a bed but a typical bed is an eight foot bed this is a small five foot plus bed and so that means that there's really not that much stuff at the end of the day that you can put in there now you might say well isn't there that sub trunk in the bed yes there is but to get it that usually means you have to take a lot of stuff out and there really isn't that much space in there and also with the tent on top you're probably not going to be able to get down in there of course there's still the frunk there's still under seat storage there's a lot more storage on this truck i think that you know and we over packed we brought the starlink which is humongous it comes in a humongous box so i mean you could probably be camping for quite a while in this thing it's just something to consider if you wanted to bring some other fancy stuff and speaking of starlink what's cool is because you've got that outlet you can easily plug it in now i know the new rv starlink has 12 volt as well but this makes it really easy to use the starlink on a trip so a little tip i learned you want to remember at night when you're done using all of your electrical outlets on the rivian to shut off the outlets and shut off your gear guard unless you need it in the area you're in because it's going to be on all night and it's going to be using juice and in the morning we were surprised at how much juice we had used for our camp kitchen all right so uh how much energy did we use cooking um oh we had 143 miles to start this morning we now have 119. we used uh 24 miles of range to cook breakfast and don't forget that that's not including what we used to charge the bikes last night so last night we had 162 miles of range and so we used 19 miles of range to charge up the bikes and to run you know a laptop or two so are we going to be able to make it home yes but remember that problem we had at the electrify america charger the other day where it wasn't quite working and we had to be on the phone for half an hour so i'm not looking forward to going home tomorrow and yeah something to think about here is unlike a normal trip where you're not really using a whole lot of juice from your car while it's sitting there here you might be using a lot of juice so keep that in mind and make sure you can get back to whatever charger you need to get to and i mean worst case i'll be honest we could have driven just a few miles to a level two charger and sat there for several hours to build up enough range to get to a bigger charger but let's get to that when we get to it so that night we wanted to cook dinner but it was raining um and we didn't have an awning for the camp kitchen so we just you know we ate somewhere else right so then it was my night in the tent uh it was rainy but we had the rain fly i stayed dry the whole night really nice pitter patter of the rain in the morning and stuff that uh we heard some coyotes i was glad to be up six feet because there were a lot of them they weren't anywhere nearby but a lot of howling i was glad to be where i was so then in the morning tent's all wet we had to pack it up wet because we had to leave so that wasn't so much fun packing up all this wet gear and bikes but you know that's not rivien's fault but here's the thing the truck no longer had enough range to get home so we decided not to use the electrify america charger in plymouth again instead we opted for the nearest fast charger on the cape it was an evgo station at the cape cod mall so i pulled into the only available stall out of the two evgo stations there luckily charging started immediately but the charging speed was pegged at 39 kilowatts even though it's a 50 kilowatt charger so i checked the plugshare app by the way and i found out that everyone else had had the same experience for the past two weeks so i had to sit there for about an hour and i still barely made it home with 27 miles of range left because i couldn't charge up to what i wanted to on the other hand i stopped at a supercharger in my model 3 and way up in orleans just oh the first supercharger i'll just go there pulled in got 150 kilowatts and my battery wasn't even that empty so i was in and out 15 minutes i wasn't even worried about range either so i zipped home i got there an hour before zach got home we left at the same time and i mean that's an important point there because i mean we were on kind of a leisurely trip so an hour here an hour and a half there didn't matter so much but you tell me i mean most times when you're taking a trip do you want to lose an hour or an hour and a half probably not so when reviewing a car reviewers typically break everything up into little sections it makes it more readable or watchable but it also allows important things to seem much less important for instance you can put charging speed in the same line as charging availability and not get the true picture what you really want to know is how easily and fast can this vehicle be charged and it doesn't allow the reviewer to put the appropriate amount of weight on points that deserve it and charging in this case was a huge point yeah it transformed what should have been a very relaxing two-day trip into a stress-filled experience and i know what you're saying the charging only took about three hours of your trip but it really limited what we were able to do and how we felt about it this stupid network and everyone everyone who ever says to me oh jesse it's a great network i use it all the time you're a liar i mean i had stress and anxiety about is this charger gonna work when we get there yeah and how are we going to be able to get home are we gonna have to you know what's gonna happen to the bikes if we have to put the truck on a tow truck stressful yeah it brought charging into our vacation it should have never been part of our vacation uh charging should have just been a thing stopping to go to the bathroom yeah we got to the campsite an hour later than we expected with way less range than we wanted and i was worried the whole time because there was no guarantee that the charger at the mall would work and i mean that's it for fast chargers in that part of our whole state i mean yeah there's a nissan dealership um there's some other network that i had never heard of and i didn't really want to stop there either and then there was this one charger and if that one charger didn't work we would still be there pretty much right and every charger you go to that doesn't work is more range that you're wasting right so if we were oh i guess i'll try this one oh we'll try this one you're going miles out of your way in either direction when you could have just been heading home or heading to that one charger that you think is going to work and i hear what you're saying well then why'd you choose cape cod maybe that's a dumb place to pick because you knew that charging would be bad but no we wanted to go to the white mountains up in new hampshire but there are no chargers north of manchester we had to pick a different location where there was at least something and it's not cape cod is a sleepy destination either over 4 million tourists flock there every year and to me this is where i go uh hey rivian where's the rivian adventure network i want to go on a hike or drive up mount washington i want to visit lake winnipesaukee the adirondacks maine or how about some rivian adventure chargers here on cape cod here is your chance to show what a true adventure network looks because let's face it we did a very similar trip back in 2016 in sparky we had a supercharger that was right over the bridge to the cape so it was closer than plymouth it also worked flawlessly charged us up in no time at all and we had one of the best experiences and it literally i i want to say literally pushed us to do this yep i went holy crap i've never been to the cave i would never go there otherwise really good point if we had pulled in and that had been an electrify america charger with the same experience we just had we probably never would have started this because it would have been so frustrating that we wouldn't have wanted to bring it to you and that's how amazing that is right that experience made 300 plus episodes of tesla time news possible and this is where the rivian network where is it they announced that it was going to be fully built out in 2023 with 600 charging locations and i and i get it it's not 2023 yet so i get why there wouldn't be 600 of them but there's none of them here and you might say well you know what you weren't really supposed to get your ribby and zac and jesse that was supposed to be for people in new york but let's say we did live in new york don't you think we'd want to go for an adventure up in new hampshire or cape cod those are the places on the east coast near new york that you go for adventures in i mean there are a lot of holes in the fast charging network that is non-tesla it's pretty sad pull up plug share sometime and take a look at it and really dive down when you're oh but there is a charger there see if it's a nissan dealership where you know you're not going to be able to charge your rivian there you know what i mean it's really not there yet and this is again hello rivian you could just be but don't worry rivian's got you it's freaking it's original i really thought with the release of the trucks that they would actually have a lot of chargers that would go online and so far we've barely seen any look the rivian r1t is an amazing pickup truck the torque the decent range the charging speed the cargo space the glass roof the sizeable frunk the power and air outlets and many other amazing aspects that we've shown you in videos so far everyone who sees this truck loves it they stop us and they ask us about it but let's face it it costs rivien more to make this truck than they sell it for and the selling price is not cheap even for a pickup truck if you have the money is this a fun vehicle yes but so is a lamborghini what i think everyone is waiting for whether they know it or not is what i think the tesla cyber truck promises to be a pickup truck with great range even better stats and the tesla supercharger network and if tesla can pull off a starting price in the mid-40s heck even the mid 50s they are going to control this market because again to me the r1t is a great electric pickup truck if this were 2016. yeah i agree this is a really great truck it's just that tesla has surpassed them and keeps coming up with so many great features including their amazing supercharger network which again i don't know how many times we have to say this but i don't know why you'd buy an ionic 5 or a bolt because there's no charging network for you that's anywhere near what the tesla supercharger network is if you're thinking of buying an electric car try out your friend's tesla or something first on a trip because you're going to experience what it's to charge and that's so important but i want to take a step back and i want to admit another thing which is that not all trucks or cars have to be this amazing road tripping experience i know that most cars do 90 of their traveling between home and work so to me a chevy bolt a nissan leaf those things completely reasonable really smart in terms of even an investment because you're not going to be paying for gas and all that other stuff but when we're talking about an adventure vehicle and we try to have an adventure and we end up having a stress-ridden not-so-fun time that's where i go um excuse me we weren't driving into the wilderness no cape cod is pretty much we had to find a campground on cape cod it wasn't just we just yo just drive in the woods park anywhere buddy i've been to those kinds of places in my tesla we couldn't make it in the room i would have been scared if we had driven into the woods somewhere because we would have been so far from any kind of charging network and it's all this is rivien's fault you said you were going to build a charging network where the heck is it right and this is why rivian to me just doesn't cut it and you might be saying jesse really the supercharger network again that's the one thing that you're going to bring up as the one thing that you didn't about it well rivian knew it that's why they said they'd make a network and look we didn't ask them to make a network as good as tesla's they said 600 chargers and we're well that sounds it could be pretty good because that's roughly what electrify america has but where are they going to put these chargers is it just going to be aspen and lake tahoe really is it just going to be the hoity-toity place and is it just going to be a bunch of level 2 chargers because i'm telling you right now with a big battery i mean ours isn't even the biggest battery it's 135 kilowatt hours that battery at level two is gonna take forever so unless it's right at your campsite what are you gonna do drive it two miles down the road and then walk back or something it just doesn't work zach and i were reflecting on this trip after we had it and we were why was it so stressful and unpleasant i really do think that it was the charging and the range anxiety that first punctuated the trip with a very stressful and oh my god are we going to not be able to have this trip we booked a campsite we booked a hotel uh are we really gonna have to try and cancel those are we gonna have to stop somewhere and charge for six hours look it it made two eevee drivers into be newbies okay because normally in tesla's when we do our road trips all over the world we have so many options that yes we do think about charging but there's so many good options to it do you want to stay in this town because it has a great hotel or that town because it's a great restaurant and all i have to do is look at a map and say oh there's a dot nearby i'm good don't worry i don't know about it i don't have to on the dot be let me let me see oh that's that network i had to read reviews i had to read the charts that chargers not been working for three weeks that's ridiculous amount of data that i had to sift through just to go on my vacation and this trip could have been worse because if that ev go station at the mall had one more one more nissan leaf uh ionic five a bolt anything parked there it would have been hours more it would have been hours more because again they would have been charging at uh was 39 kilowatts um and then so they would take an hour to charge up oh more probably more depends on what they what if it was another peruvian could have been another ribbon and then you would have had that's what i'm talking about here look i just want to point out when there are more ribbons in the world and there was a couple ribbons parked there at 39 kilowatts it would take three or four hours to charge that so what would i be doing i'd have to be just and we saw another rivien on the cape too right it's not oh but don't worry there are no rivens anywhere no they're out there and they're hungry they need to be charged so i'm sure that the riven that we saw on the cape i mean we saw them parked at a hotel and ran the extension cord out the window which is completely valid i'm not gonna make fun of them for that but if they're headed home and they're gonna be pulling into that plymouth uh electrify america station i i don't want that experience for them you know what i'm mad about that i know so anyway uh maybe it's not rivien's fault but they need to do something because i just don't think that it's gonna work i just want to point out again that when we got to that electrify america stall we had to reboot the vehicle because that was a rivian problem and i mean they'd had two weeks to fix this and so i mean there's a lot of software glitches there and you remember as we were driving it took us 10 minutes before the spotify would load there's lots of software glitches in this vehicle that's why i say it's a 2016 vehicle yeah but you know we are going to be taking it for another adventure this time towing a trailer because look a lot of you want to know what it's on long distance towing so we're going to be testing that thanks to one of our viewers who's letting us borrow his trailer so we're going to be reporting on that hopefully we'll have a better experience we're going to go in a different direction this time we'll try some different chargers yeah and uh we'll tell you how it goes maybe it'll be amazing who knows but we still can't go to the white mountains which is the one place that i really would to take the truck i know i'm probably gonna have to go to maine yeah and i'm worried about that too so we'll see how it goes and i want to thank our patrons so much because without you this review would not happen right um we would have had maybe we would have gotten the rivien for a week and they would have let us borrow it and we would have said it's great we didn't take it anywhere fun we drove it 40 miles we didn't have the tent we drove it down the road and we drove it back a couple times and we plugged it in at our house and it was great and we loved it um because i have to be nice and the one oh there were a few glitches um but i'm sure they'll work those out with software updates because they've uh we got a software update once and i'm sure it'll be fine you know if you watch till the end i want to give you one last little thing i don't about the ribbian which i don't think we've talked about yet if you sit in the rear seats there's one seat that's over the subwoofer and that seat is really uncomfortable really firm and uh it's don't have your friend sit in that seat now i love subwoofers but why'd you have to stick it there and why couldn't you figure out a way to make the seat more comfortable the other rear seats are not that comfortable either because of the under seat storage which i think is cool but maybe don't trade off on comfort for storage right i mean i get it the only people buying this truck are people who know i guess didn't have kids i guess i mean hey i love the um cooled seats that's really cool that's a great feature and i think tesla's you know the model 3 and the model y should have those and they don't have it yet yeah i just if we bought this truck because we wanted it if you bought this truck and you weren't a youtuber i'd be disappointed right now you'd be you'd be trying to flip it now huh yeah yeah because you should make money because there's more trucks coming and hey look i said about the cyber truck i don't know what the cyber truck is going to have but if it's a true tesla i think i'm going to be really excited about it so i mean you know we're one of the first who's getting the cyber trucks and you know that we're one of the first to be getting the uh f-150 this summer hopefully we're going to be testing those out we want to put these all head to head so that you guys know what's the truck for you and we want to be honest sometimes it means that we're going to rip the new one other times we've shown with the towing really impressive towing yeah really impressive that the regen breaking can do most of the work i i want to be honest but you gotta not jump down our throats when you're you're being mean and everyone else is being nice you must be wrong if you don't have the truck i'm sorry you don't know and and wait till we have the cyber truck and you'll see we're gonna try and find problems with that too we'll try and do some head-to-heads especially with the f-150 lightning i'll be honest it's gonna have a lot of the same problems with caribbean um but we'll give it a shot we'll let you know we'll see you next time now you know,0
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJl35aIy5pOVBHvoGgqavrdJ,wRa0XtX49bY,here on now you know we've been testing out the rivien r1t for our viewers it was important for us to buy it ourselves so that way we could give our own honest reviews without being beholden to rivien we've already tested the r1t towing the heaviest thing we can find camping with the yakima tent packing bikes on it and even making our own much cheaper version of the camp kitchen but this week we decided to test out long distance range while towing a camper next on indepth [music] and thank you to chesapeake climate action network action fund for sponsoring today's show just a reminder there's barely four weeks left before our friends at ccan give away a truly amazing tesla or launch edition rivian pickup truck ccan action fund is a non-profit promoting clean energy in the fight against heat waves floods and other impacts of climate change their creative fundraiser gives you the chance to win a top of the line electric vehicle while helping a good cause and here's the update the raffle is still undersold the group has barely sold 2500 tickets with nearly 3 000 still unpurchased so that's fantastic news for anyone who already bought a ticket or who wants one now visit evie raffle.org to take advantage of these ridiculously good odds another reminder the group went out and actually bought a rivian truck they have it in their garage in mint condition and you get the keys the day of the drawing no waiting and if a riven isn't what you want the winner can choose a build your own tesla instead with up to 135 000 in tesla credits to play with amazing all this for a ticket price of just 200 again tickets are way undersold all proceeds fund the nonprofits work to save the planet buy your tickets at evraffle.org your odds may never be better big thanks to our viewer al who lent us his trailer to test out we loaded up with everything we needed and we even added an e-bike trailer for good measure after we got all packed up we hopped in the r1t and started to plan for charging all right so we're planning our trip here and uh we're gonna be going up to maine so it's 97 miles to get there we currently have 135 and we're gonna get there with 88. wait what it's it's not it's not that close wait so that means it doesn't take into account that we're towing it does there but it doesn't hear so the two don't talk to each other i mean this is proportionally the correct amount we were at 88 miles yesterday and it was roughly that battery amount so it's it was driving regular it takes that percentage and then says convert that to miles but it didn't take the miles oh my god really really good come on man you know what that means we should just use a better route planner all right so you've planned our route and uh it's we got to be conservative here right because we don't know we don't know i mean i can enter in you know kind of what we were getting in terms of miles per kilowatt hour but it's not going to be perfect and i want to be on a plane conservatively there's a electrify america charger in kittery maine we're headed a little bit further up to old orchard so i mean you can see that the difference between kittery and there is this is almost double so i think we're definitely going to want to hit the kittery one the question is if we're going to want to hit uh seabrook first and seabrook is right here i'm going to set it to seabrook it's gonna take us there we're definitely gonna arrive with enough uh range hopefully the chargers are gonna work there let's go all right let's do it [music] [music] all right so we've been on the trip for about 45 minutes and we've had a good long stretch of consistent driving i would say uh high 60s not really much over 70 but you know i've had to accommodate with traffic we've been getting about 1.22 miles per kilowatt hour so that's our efficiency that should be giving us a range right now of 108 miles so we're going to be hitting basically the the soonest charger just to uh kind of reevaluate there take a break take a look and see what we've done and see if we can make it all the way to main or if we can make it to the next charger and we'll assess there so i mean as you can see this is not going to be an ideal setup but it isn't a bad setup there is enough room for people to drive through it's just really unhooking and hooking up this trailer takes a long time there's a lot of steps that you have to kind of go through so this is kind of the best option and we shouldn't be here for that long anyway all right so we made it up to seabrook new hampshire this is one of the electrify america chargers that's on our route it is roughly 43 miles away from where we live and we do not need to charge here so here's an example where it's important that all the chargers be working at a charging station this is really the best spot for me to be parked i think i could also maybe charge at that one if i parked over there but i don't think that i could be parked in these spaces here because then i'd be blocking a much tighter row and preventing people from pulling in or pulling out it's very case specific but again this is why it's important i would just be able to basically make this cable reach i'm not really parked in the correct spot but i don't think that anyone would mind and again i do have to give credit to electrify america they picked a spot where it's not maybe as luxurious as you know being parked down by panera but it's out of the way so that way you can do kind of dumb stuff this start and it's 19 miles away we can definitely make it as you can see we're pulling in completely incorrectly we're blocking all four spots but there's really no way that we could do this without having to um leave the trailer out in the middle of traffic or de-hitch so we're gonna plug in real quick if someone comes along and needs the charger we'll get out of their way in fact they could just pull into this stall here and uh in charge and hopefully we'll be on our way pretty quickly what's taking so long been here three minutes already i've been trying to start up my app i've started it twice and it just sits on the loading screen come on oh car locked [music] that's good i don't know i just put a new battery in it too okay unlock hit the unlock button well that's good at least we're not locked out this is not what you want to feel when you're walking for a primary charge for a tesla we would be charging probably done by now i know that's what we're talking about people all right so phone is booting up again i'm gonna hit the electrify america app okay starting screen starts although i'm not going to overly excited oh here we go great you want to create an account i don't i want to log in log in hit the skip up there i i think you got to wait till this little thing is done something expected occur check your internet connection i've got a little bit of lce okay sorry this is looking good so good select the charger right swipe to charge [music] whoo this system it does say to unplug it i don't know what are you supposed to do i i yeah which processing payment and shading charging just plug in and you're plugged in connecting to vehicle initiating charging [music] i feel i'm at the casino initiating charging this is good blood pressure was high yeah still is actually because we're blocking all these chargers i'm just waiting for the excuse me i know right here we go 43 cents a kilowatt hour that is highway robbery my friend all right but the good news is we are charging let's go check in the car and see what uh rate we're trying okay so we finally finally finally got charging since that it's 136 kilowatts that's great i mean yeah that's pretty good this is 150 kilowatt charger so we're doing great when i'm traveling i think everybody knows at this point if you've been watching the for a while that i get anxiety um and i have anxiety right now because we're blocking for electrifying america stalls and i feel horrible about it i feel really bad about it well the the good part is right in front of us you could park and charge we we aren't stopping that bay from oh kona just pulled in i feel terrible already can he plug in at the same time we might need to back up a little bit and go to the other charger we might just leave i don't know yeah let's just leave okay we're good to go so if you want to just um let us out we can we can give you the whole thing i mean we're not really done charging but i mean we can make it it's just uh i feel horrible no i feel a bad person for doing this i don't know what else i was supposed to do wow i just feel so awful i feel a bad person you shouldn't i do yeah we gotta sort something else out huh got to be a different system for this yeah no this wasn't great are you talking about the bigger picture yeah oh and not just you and me no it's not i mean this isn't i wouldn't say this is our fault i was looking in the rear view mirrors just waiting i was the first time in my life i'd been hoping to not see an electric car no one's thought about this this case of trailering i mean they have tesla has thought of it they have pull throughs and stuff but electrify america is so rudimentary that they haven't thought of it yet so you really can't do any kind of trailers and it's not just campers i mean you might be pulling some bikes or if you're a contractor and you've got something so it is a very common use case all right so traffic has really let up here and i've been able to go a little bit faster we've been doing about 70 72 and that's really affected our range i think there's also been some hills um and that has uh affected as well we're down to .98 miles per kilowatt hour so that would give the range of the truck less than 135 miles total um and it's dropped our range estimate down to 73 miles left in the tank i think it's because we've been going fast so to compensate i'm gonna now slow down to maybe a low 60. all right i want to say we've only been going 60 for a very short amount of time but i'm already seeing on that graph on the left that the line is going up so i feel it's making a difference what do you think i think it's definitely making a difference and it makes complete sense right we've reduced our speed by 10 miles an hour it's going to have a huge impact in terms of uh air resistance yeah because if you look at the back of this trailer here it it is slightly rounded but it's not that rounded it's just a big thing that the wind hits and jesse we're on the list to get the r1s i think another reason why we should get the r1s is that it might be more efficient in towing because it's got a back that the wind is just going to slip over and then up and over your trailer interesting and so if we tested that it might be well it might be cool to get the scientific data yeah that's my argument for getting it anyway okay yeah so i mean definitely heading at 60 miles an hour makes a difference you can already see that we're back up to 1.25 and we haven't even gone the full 15 minutes yet so that's on average with going 72 and then going to 60. so it makes a huge difference to slow down again no big surprise but i think it also i've been in uh cruise control just regular old dumb cruise control and uh i think that that makes a difference as well you know before i had been accelerating and de-accelerating between you know 73 and 65 and i think that that acceleration is what really chews through a lot of batteries so being able to go more constant speed yes you'll have to contend with hills but there's far less accelerating and de-accelerating and i think that that is what's making a huge difference in terms of range as well as obviously uh the air resistance so we made it to maine with about 60 miles remaining in tow mode and we set about getting our camper ready for camping all right so we're set up here at the campsite and uh all campsites are a little different but you're probably gonna end up with a box something this it's got your breakers there it's got a 220 volt outlet there and a 110 volt outlet here we're using the 110 volt outlet now the rivien comes with a couple different dongles this one is for a 220 volt so it can take both voltages unfortunately we don't have the right plug if i unplug the rv for a second you'll see that this plug will not go in here you can buy adapters and i think even rivien sells some this is not the correct one but there's something this basically two different uh size plugs they both are uh 220 volt ac and so you could get it to the right socket for this and then be able to charge your car at kind of a level two speed which would be nice um but at the moment we're just charging at i think two kilowatts which is really slow uh it would take about a day to half charge the car yeah it'll be done in four days oh great but the cool part is that is now that we've dropped off the camper the rivian can pull away and in fact the range is going to be significantly higher we have 139 miles now instead of the 70 that we arrived with or actually even 60 that we arrived with so that can get us over to a fast charger if we need to we don't have this big trailer behind us we can charge up separate from the trailer leave the trailer as home base so zack and i went off for a relaxing e-bike ride through beautiful old orchard maine and then later we headed to portland for dinner on the way home we stopped at an electrify america charger to get some extra range that would get us home the next day hey look it's more than 150 kilowatts yeah 350 baby it's great this is awesome i mean this truck is awesome i mean look where's the where's the trailer at the campsite we left it at the campsite safe and sound that's the cool part about trailering i will admit you know we got here with 60 miles of range left if you're dragging a trailer with you um as soon as we unhitch it now we have 120 130 miles of range which you just go ah okay we probably could have made it with with the trailer too but why bring it if we don't have to and now we're not blocking anybody we're just a just an ordinary rivien at a walmart someone's trailering over there it would have been so much cheaper and easier if we just trailers right here we should just camp at a walmart from now on much better and look charging right here [music] the next morning we had some breakfast and discussed our thoughts as well as our plans for the trip home all right so we have a couple days of rving under our belt now yeah and i feel i've gained a little bit more insight into charging can we talk about charging with a trailer at a dc fast charger it's totally hit or miss with tesla superchargers you're generally going to have eight chargers or more and i feel what we did yesterday we pulled in and blocked all the the dc fast chargers i hated that i hated that too hey look i don't want to do that that that's wrong we immediately when that ionic showed up we immediately left we apologized we left but with tesla superchargers it is much more possible that if there's eight or twelve that you could block four three or four and still allow everyone else to do their charging because let's face it most chargers outside of california they're not they're not packed so that's one possibility the second thing is i do think you should be prepared to have to de-hitch and i know that that's not something that you look forward to because to hitch a trailer this takes about five to ten minutes but if you actually played that to your advantage so de-hitch and hang out in it for an hour and a half and watch a movie or take a nap and then because you're going to be there for a while and here's where i think the ford is going to have an advantage because this trailer in particular takes 220 in and then it distributes it into um you know regular wall outlets but the ribbian doesn't have any 220 outlets if the ford which should have a 220 volt outlet that can lead to some very interesting stuff so basically if you pulled in to say an electrifying america charger you parked the trailer adjacent to the charger that you were going to use and then you know you've either pulled in or backed in the ford and you were fast charging it you could still take the 220 volt outlet plug it into your trailer so you could have air conditioning you could be charging up all your devices you could be turning on a tv you could be doing all the normal things you do in a trailer minus the the water and sewage oh that's interesting which the rivian does not have because i forgot without air conditioning if it was a hot day you wouldn't want to be in the trailer that's a great idea i mean i want to talk about the driving for a minute i mean with the trailer the regen braking was excellent how often did you actually brake with the with the brake pedal i did it one time when somebody cut out in front of us an entire trip to maine and you basically only hit the brake pedal once didn't use brake pads um we have the middle battery size 135 kilowatt hours of the ravy and we had to get that one because we wanted the truck while it was still new but they do have a 180 kilowatt hour truck coming out soon and that range should be uh a lot higher they say 400 miles plus that's not towing with towing i would expect it to be more 200 miles that doesn't feel a big difference to me but i think that it actually i think it is and i want to say that i am super excited about the cyber truck because the top-end cyber truck if elon is right and can deliver 500 miles of range that would mean half of that range would be 250 and i think 250 does do what i was talking about which is for most people they wouldn't have to charge to get to their location i think that that's an excellent point and the other thing is if you did have to charge you'd only have to charge once per day um there's a very small chance you'd be traveling more than 500 miles per day that means that you could unhitch because you're only doing it once that day go charge the truck bring the truck back hitch back up because you're only doing it once that day and then drive off let's talk about charging speed for a second so at a lot of these electrify america stations you're going to get 150 kilowatts some of them you are going to get 300 or 350. this truck can only take 212 we that's the number we seem to have seen as the max and that's with a low battery charge right and at a 350 kilowatts right so being honest here you're maxing out usually gonna be around 150. that's not bad i don't want to make fun of it but when we're talking cyber truck most likely it's going to be able to take 250 maybe even more yeah and that's going to be a huge factor because if it can take 250 kilowatts even though it's going to have a massive battery it's going to be charging really fast and i mean we've been hearing about new superchargers in the world uh yeah 300 350. if the cyber truck can do 350 which i think it might be able to um game changer that would be a game changer as well i know right now they have pull-ins and some places especially i think in europe have a lot of pull throughs more pull throughs the better for trailering to me top of mind if i'm thinking about trailering with an electric vehicle is speed of unhitching if you can get something down to a science if you can basically park it in a spot and then de-hitch very quickly you know have one person on chains one person on uh getting the the ball hitch unlocked and lifted and and parking brake set charging won't be that bad i have a theory that if we took back roads we would be able to make it without charging it would take longer because we would be driving slower and on back roads when we were driving on back roads our efficiency was much higher so i mean there's a curve obviously right and the faster you go you hit more and more wind resistance so you think that 60 seems to be a sweet spot while we were traveling on the highway but i mean that was getting us you know 1.3 miles per kilowatt hour i think taking back roads we can get closer to two because to your point 70 miles an hour was getting us more one mile per kilowatt i mean it's diminishing returns i'm talking more about heading at 30 or 40 and so that's not going to be probably the same efficiency boost as going from 70 to 60 but i think that it's going to be significant enough that we could make it home without a full charge we have about 83 84 well do you want to test this yeah i think we could take some back roads i think that it would change the experience of the trip a little bit it would be a little bit more adventurous a little bit more relaxed instead of just sitting on an interstate but do you think that the rivian nav system is going to make it easy for us to do that or do you think we're going to have to use something a better root planer i'm going to be using my skills that i have learned with my model 3 which is called back roading it's jesse's back roading skills it's uh it's kind of doing a maze you know at the restaurant except there's multiple ways because it's a road network as opposed to amazing but in the tesla you are able now to do waypoints never needed it oh so you're just winging it i i was doing this before they had way points so i see i can wing it and i think we'll make it okay and if not there's a few you know fast chargers does that mean i should drive and you should navigate or you're gonna drive i can do the whole thing wow all right i love it now so we're driving home from maine and this doesn't look a highway jesse yep taking the back roads and it's so far it's paying off in terms of efficiency we're hitting 1.76 and going up i mean what i've been driving for the past five minutes i think we're gonna be able to hit around uh two miles per kilowatt hour and that's kind of what the truck normally gets how we doing on range i think my theory might might be a little disproven here back roads are different everywhere so i wasn't expecting a 55 mile an hour back road i mean yeah we're on a bit more of a main route as opposed to a highway but yeah 55 is really not giving us a range advantage and plus there there are more hills on on these sorts of routes and just going up hills just sucks up range i mean sure you don't have to use as much on the way down but uh i think we're gonna find that this is gonna be pretty moot so we had a bit of a slower section i was in the high 30s low 40s and i was able to pull up my efficiency to 1.6 miles per kilowatt hour which i'm very pleased with i think that that is even better than what we were doing before and so just everyone knows normally if you're just driving without a trailer in this truck you're a little over two miles per kilowatt hour yeah so approaching two is a good thing it's amazing it's amazing yeah now i i want to stress that i have been hypermiling i have not been just driving normally i've been really causing backups i'll be honest i've been i've been slow yeah you're really slow at red lights once you're pulling away into the green light yes that's one of them the other thing is as soon as i feel i don't need to be accelerating i will back off and this is actually kind of interesting right here um i'll give it a little bit more juice which i wouldn't normally do and then i'm going to kind of accelerate see that little line right there oh it's hard to hit with your foot that line means that i'm basically in neutral i can't do it for very long because we're going uphill but see how i'm approaching the crest of this hill right here here we go once we hit it i'm going to try and hit the line i'm not going to try and use regen i'm just going to coast so this is me coasting i'm staying constant at 47 right here because we're going at a slight downhill and that's basically i think the most efficient way you can move anytime you are putting energy into or out of the motors there is a little bit of inefficiency there the most efficient thing you can do is just roll in terms of getting the most range on a hole there are some exceptions to that obviously when you need to slow down it's best to be using regen braking and it's best to be using that for for longer as opposed to having to use full regen braking and then hit the actual brakes and turning your energy into heat so yeah just little things that little tweaks to the way that i drive i think are going to make a big difference in our total range how taxing is it to your brain to have to drive this i will be honest it is a little bit more taxing i really do have to be thinking about it i can't just be you know putting pedal to the metal i can't just be accelerating and waiting to break here i'm coming up to a red light i'm on the line right now i'm slowing down because i don't know when it's going to turn green and it's better for me to be rolling when i approach it so i'm actually going to okay so now it's green now i can start accelerating but the guy in front of me still has his brake lights on so i'm just going to slowly accelerate and now i'm going to be catching up to him and i don't want them to cut me off because that would be bad so he's cutting me off but this guy won't because he sees freezing in his life and so now i just smoothly transitioned i didn't come to a stop you know jesse i was just noticing how pretty it is when you take back roads because we came the same way except on the highway right we didn't get to see any of this great stuff and we're going through dover new hampshire which is beautiful there is a big plus to taking the back roads yeah i mean on top of efficiency there's you could just get to see more i mean if you're going on a camping trip or an adventure i mean yes there is a value in getting there quickly um but sometimes there's a value in being an adventure jesse i was just taking a look at your efficiency graph here and wow you're almost off the charts uh yeah i mean we're approaching two miles per kilowatt hour and uh with the trailer that's really amazing because the thing that i've been hearing over and over again is that uh electric if you tow you get half the mileage yes if you take it on the highway yes that's true if you don't take it on the highway and you're taking it back roads you're taking it slow sub 45-ish miles an hour i think you can hit 1.8 ish miles per kilowatt hour it's gonna depend on the trailer it's gonna depend on the wheel bearing it's gonna depend on the temperature outside it's gonna depend on a lot of things we have a lot going for us right here and i'm trying to hyper mile it but in the worst case scenario if we had uh taken the wrong turn and gotten you know basically blown off course by 20 or 30 miles and we weren't going to make it to a charger this could really save our skin all right so we're wrapping this up we're almost home yeah and uh we have 54 miles remaining wait a second yeah uh people are gonna think we didn't go anywhere i know or people think we're gonna charged we didn't charge but we have 54 miles remaining wait but we only had 80 battery when we left this morning in maine it shows you that hyper myelin can work now it took us twice as long to get home sure but i saw a whole bunch of the country that i've never seen before that's a good point you know i've seen saw a lot of maine a lot of new hampshire it's very pretty we use a lot less energy used a lot less energy and we didn't have to stop and charge didn't have to unhitch didn't have to worry about anything and now it's just starting to rain perfect [music] well we hope that you found those tips uh useful we're going to be testing out more trucks this summer i guess if we get our ford uh we want to show you how electric pickup trucks work with all kinds of uses because these are the trucks you're going to use to tow things and stuff and so we wanted to show you range and all that good stuff comment down below the things that you want us to show you that we haven't already and we'll hopefully be doing that with our ford f-150 see you next time now you know,0
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJl35aIy5pOVBHvoGgqavrdJ,ZVbYNIpE0Yo,uh dad what are you what are you doing well we got a pickup truck didn't we gonna do some work it's not a work truck this is an adventure vehicle okay but what if you went for an adventure up to your cabin in the woods where there's no power there's no air compressor we've got all that here so we have a power we got power we got air let's do it let's make some work with the truck all right let's do it next on now you know so this truck has got an air compressor and it's got power yeah so i first thought we'd start with the air okay and we start with the easy stuff filling up a soccer ball that's easy that should be easy for the compressor level one that's level one then i thought we'd move on to uh filling up some tires okay if you get low tires you wanna fill that up yep then we'd move on to a power tool you know an air tool this is just a little easy peasy brad gun okay able to handle it if it can handle that maybe it can handle a finished nailer okay maybe i don't know we're gonna find out if we can handle that maybe it can handle a framing nailer yep and maybe if it can handle that it could handle this which actually uses a lot of air this is an impact wrench yep so we're gonna try that out too so that's all the air stuff we're gonna check out for you all right let's do it okay so we're gonna fill up a soccer ball yeah to do that we're gonna need the kit that comes with it they store it in this gear tunnel door uh it's this little kit here okay it's air hose and all the different attachments we need so let's see what we got in here we got some all the squishy right now i don't know if that's gonna fill that was uh my soccer ball when i back when i did soccer so all right so this kit comes with quite a few things it comes with even a few valves oh cool for bikes and stuff uh number tires too oh really i mean tires of any sort that's great it comes with this nice long hose i think you can reach all the tires on the truck with this that's cool and that's a normal looking air hose it's a nice looking hose uh so yeah i'm gonna go hook one into the truck all right hooked in there i'm ready for air okay let's see uh it's definitely leaking out yeah yeah so that's not although there's some air coming out that way too but is enough air i mean there's definitely a way that we could give it enough time and fittings i'm sure we could find it doesn't fit in there no it just popped soon wait wait the ball is left squishy i mean it is filling up yeah all right yeah let's call it there all right hey all right it was flat before okay so that worked all right test number one level zero i would say that is complete all right so level two then would be let's fill up some tires and the nice part about this you can set the pressure yeah so i'll read the pressure you set the pressure okay and then we'll fill this tire all right all right so according to the tire we need 51 psi wow okay 51 ready i'm ready when you are okay here we go i'm asking for it oh it's giving these little spurts that's because i'm pressing the play button i'm not getting anything now are you just holding it yeah i'm holding it waiting for you to give me i i hit it and then it does it for a second so i think that the problem we might be running into is that it's measuring the pressure from here so you see when i hit the play button it says on and then watch it it drops back down so the pressure has to fill the whole hose before it can make it to the tire so maybe i need to set the set pressure a little higher so what are you set at now i'm set at 65 that's the only way i could get it to go and then as soon as you stop you just stopped it builds up the thing and then it decides to stop doing it okay now it's working but that is annoying because the pressure drop in the hose is leading to a misread at the at the pump itself that's 51. that's 51. okay so we did it we did it all right well i would say that's a win so soccer ball tire no problem level one next up is a brad nailer oh yeah let me get some brads just to show everyone what we're talking about here so these are brads these are basically very very small nails usually used in cabinetry right and stuff that now i'm just gonna be honest here i don't think it's gonna work really why not well because you need about 80 pounds per square inch to to use it okay and we already had some problems with the tire so i don't know uh why don't you go set that to 80 okay and i'll get some a piece of wood okay i hear it pumping okay so now we're at 80. hey it worked a little deep actually yeah you want to back it off a bit yeah give it a couple more shots that first shot went in no there's no brad in there we need a little more power okay was that one that one worked yeah it's kind of hit or miss oh no it's completely out it's really unreliable i have to hit the button after every shot oh really so what we're doing is um we're building up pressure in the hose so can i just point out when you use a real pneumatic system on the job yeah you have a compressor yes and you have a tank yes and the compressor fills that tank up to whatever output pressure you want and then usually above that above that and then you hit the right later right what we have here with the truck is there's no tank we just have a compressor so we do have a tank it's called the hose the hose is building pressure and that's what we're using so i don't know how to count this i'm gonna say this is a fail i mean yes we did shoot some nails but it's not reliable for for tool usage because hey you had to be over there hitting it every time and b even when you did you can see sometimes it worked and other times it didn't so you can't reliably do work that so i think maybe uh we would just stick with a hammer yeah if we really needed it maybe we'd have to come up some kind of tank i mean that might be a product that someone could come up with yes all right but you know what let's just check and see if finish nailer would work let's just try it all right so let me cut it to a hundred okay okay we're at 100 that worked nice oh and i heard it go back up again it's uh nice that worked oh uh i'm gonna take back what i said before wait so why didn't it work with the brad nailer i think at a lower psi it wasn't so it's reliable or something at 100 it's just i don't know but this worked fine i that was five shots in a row so i mean i should be able to actually nail these two pieces together oh it's got some kick too oh so even though i said fail on brad nailer i think pass on finish nailer well okay so now i just want to try the brad nailer one more time okay okay so now with it set at 100 i mean i'm i'm expecting some shrapnel because i'm gonna go through both here that felt weak sauce is it on no it's dropping in pressure now so i it's unreliable that's so inconsistent okay hang on because i that says 49 what the there's two different modes okay now you're at 98 97 so it's dropping 104 103 okay 102 80 100 80 60 100 114 okay so i take back what i said i guess that um as long as you check before you do it it it works yeah i think i ran out of brad's so okay okay so now i think we have to go to the big boy yeah let's go up to our cabin in the woods and build a cabin in the woods this is the this is the gun that built our house so yeah built a lot of houses uh so we're set at 100 you want to go a little higher is it 34 now okay so it must shut off after a certain period of time yeah which makes sense because you just forget about it forget about it there you go 100 100 all right oh give me a 110 okay 100 110 oh yeah yep whoa yeah nice we can build a cabin in the woods i mean it might be annoying because i think after a certain period of time because now it's down to 65. so i mean okay you wouldn't want to build a cabin with it in the woods because you'd have to keep checking before every shot well but if you had to do a little light work with the pneumatic gun you could do it yeah i don't know hammer might actually be less work i think the tank would be the necessary key missing element but it's not going to stay on so tank or no tank so this is more of a just a light use it's for tires just for tires it's for tires and balls but let's check the last thing we were going to check okay can you use a pneumatic right impact camera and here we're losing all of the advantages that we had before right now i think we should actually test it with a real use case yeah let's actually drive in a lag bolt let's pretend you're up in the woods and you need to fix something on your cabin or whatever okay um and let's see we'll drill into this okay we'll drill these two pieces so the together thing is we charged this in the r1t right so that's been charged we are now going to uh we got to turn this up to 100 again all right here we go it's going hang on there's a hundred give me a hundred again it's going i didn't hit it that time [music] sometimes it goes to 50. i don't know why yeah boy it uses up that hundred real fast because all that's being stored is in the hose we're gonna do it we're gonna do it it's gonna happen uh just use a wrench at this point huh i don't know i mean i'm not gonna say it's a fail uh i will it's sneezing it in okay well we did it though come on we did it so if we really wanted to rip it off without stabbing can i speak to the rivian engineers i know you're very brilliant you built a really nice truck do not one of you have an uncle or somebody who works in construction that you could have said hey uncle what should our compressor do can you this is an adventure vehicle i'm doing an adventure right now oh you're building building means a house i'm hanging a hammock in a tree in the woods no i'm making a tree house they make straps for those hammock sack see see no this is not adventuring if you had a tank riviera this would actually run for a bit if you had a regulator so you could pump it up to maybe i don't know what this goes up to i'm let me just 200. let me check if it does you can do anything with it let me do 200. tell me when you're at 200. oh my god i can go higher can i use my gun i can go to 296 psi oh yeah you want to try that yeah baby all right it's 150 it doesn't seem to want to do more than that oh yeah so i think it's only 150 but i mean 150 is what a normal uh contractor tank gets up to roughly yeah a crappy one um if you had the tank then that and it was in the bed um and it could hold some amount of pressure then you could run this tool for a little bit longer and i think maybe we should even try and build one but anyway we've shown you the air tools i think we should go on to the electrical i think it might be a little bit better let's try it all right so for electric tools i think that the first one is going to be the most common which is battery electric tools because you know you can get them in all shapes and sizes you can use a sawzall if you want of course a drill the nice part about that is you just have to charge them so now before we plug that in figured we test the actual wattage okay coming out of the outlet so we got with you know a kilowatt thing here we read online that rivien says you can get 1500 watts out of this outlet okay now i think i'm gonna have to go turn it on in the cab oh okay i don't know how to do that but uh so you wanna plug that in oh yeah yeah between it yep so we can see what we're drawing okay so first just tell me if that just works out of the box or if i have to go turn something on no lights okay so i gotta turn that on all right so somewhere here i don't know where they put it here we go so it's under a power symbol 120 volt outlets use the outlets with caution do not leave devices plugged in and unattended in the gear tunnel blah blah blah turn them on all right they should be on we got it plugged in this battery is fully charged so hand me that drill yeah okay so we're drawing 50 watts now it's charging okay so i think this is level one we were testing before and level one of course works but i think we should test the next level which would be an actual plugged in power tool what's kind of our lightest plug-in power tool would you say maybe that uh jigsaw yeah let's do the jigsaw first there we go then they're wake it up wow weird all right well let's see if it works [applause] so you were drawing about 500 watts okay that works i would say our level two test you could do some work with it let's uh find a bigger power tool all right how about a sawzall hell yeah i'm guessing this is going to draw more 900 watts but i don't know find out we'll cut through some oak here ready yeah that was 900 watts did i call it or what yeah i'm guessing this is going to draw more 900 watts 900 watts all right uh what else do we have how about you want to try the sander yeah let's do some sanding all right ready what are you drawing about 600 600 with no load put it under load [applause] you do uh peaked at 900 50 900 all right let's see i think i have another tool that might use a little more that would be my milwaukee circular saw all right [music] that's 800 800 with no load so i think we're gonna go up to probably a thousand ready ready [applause] that was eleven hundred eleven hundred watts all right how about a wet two by three about 1200 1200 watts so i mean that works i'm kind of impressed you know what i really want to push it though you want to push it we used all of the power tools didn't we what oh the welder yeah uh let's weld something so first we need the angle grinder okay because i gotta grind off some of that mill scale and then let's uh weld this is a flux core gasless mig and it runs on 110. it can run on 110 it can also run at 220 but we're doing it on 110 today and uh yeah so i better put my welding helmet well i'm gonna clean up i'm gonna get stuff cleaned up and then we'll try it out good thing we have electricity so i can use my angle grinder all right let's try it out right all right so that was six 700 watts yeah uh and it worked a charm all right uh i'll plug in the welder let's do it okay i'm gonna turn on the welder okay welder turns on 70 watts 20 watts 16 watts okay so now i have to get the wire out so let's just see if it shuts off when i turn it on ready 40 watts there we go okay so um i just want to ask what do you think the chances are that we're going to blow the breaker you don't know all right hey hey this is new welding with the r1t let's do it let's do it all right ready ready ethan you close your eyes oh no i saw it go to 200 watts and then oh no well we could turn down the amps we can turn down the amps dang it but let's go in the cab and see what happens yeah when it blows so yeah it's off but i think we can just turn it back on okay oh so that was that was not that big a deal yeah it's some kind of digital breaker okay do you remember what energy we had when we started yeah 213. oh wow wait so we used five miles of range uh when we started at the very beginning of the show yeah okay are we ready ready here we go 700 watts how many 700 700 that was not a good weld but is it gonna stay uh no not yet let me do another one let me do another one okay are you ready ready okay ah dang it uh too bad but i mean it did that is a weld technically yeah let's see yeah it's a tack weld so what i'm confused about is that i was able to weld for two or three seconds at 700 watts yeah and then for some reason it spiked yeah i don't know maybe it's because it came out too far maybe if i was a better welder it's not really ideal you want it to be able to make this whole wire glow orange so yeah so what do you think is it you can't weld with the r1p because this is the least amount of well this is a pretty beginner welder so i think welding is off with the r1t but there is one last thing i want to test okay which i don't think we talked about what can you charge another vehicle with the r1t oh my gosh so let me pull sparky up and see if we can charge sparky from the r1t all right let's do that all right so i got the mobile charger from sparky okay i'll give you that end all right and uh let's see what happens all right here we go okay we got red oh that's not good red red usually does not mean good red is not good how about if we go direct to the outlet yeah let's try that oh oh we had green for a second now really oh go go into sparky and set the amperage lower oh yeah it was set too high so yeah set it down to 12. yeah let's try that charging equipment reports error check equipment for error code or message hmm let me turn it down some more okay we go down to nine eight amps all right charging equipment reports error all right let me try unplugging it from both things maybe it's a bit happier we'll see ah could it be the charger maybe it's too smart do we have a dumb charger let's try the rivian charger okay and we'll put the adapter on it all right all right so we'll charge with the ribbon charger at least we'll try it as tesla owners know you can't take a j1772 and plug it directly into a tesla you have to use the tesla adapter so put that on here it could just be non-compatible electrons for all we know damn come on oh oh wait blue what's the blue it says ready to charge ready to charge it's blue blue is it actually is the driving actually sending out it has to be otherwise this wouldn't be glowing it's going red oh it's red it's not good that's not good no why would this not work should i ask for less amps more amps i'll ask for less amps as for one i'm down to five amps as low as i can go yep nope it turns red this should definitely work it's any other outlet i think that i noticed when you turned on your circular saw that it didn't go it went okay does it have some kind of a ramp some kind of a thing that lets the charger know hey this isn't a standard outlet well let's try one more thing i have an idea okay can you charge a rivian from arien we already got the charger plugged in let's try it uh okay the charger already doesn't to do this but we'll try it we'll try okay is the is the cable long enough is the big question it looks it is hit feed it to me that way okay oh it's long enough [music] what are you hoping to accomplish with this i'm gonna charge the car from itself so now i can't open the driver's door because you need to i maybe i do it's not turning green yeah just the charger knows that something's wrong how does it know something's wrong i don't know so the ribbon can't charge another ev and it can't even charge itself come on all right so the rivian charger did not being plugged into the ravine at all it wouldn't charge sparking it wouldn't charge itself of course it wouldn't charge itself but the price the charger didn't to be plugged into the river no either we have a leaf charger and a leaf so let's try it and the leaf is not charging no all right well i think that's about as conclusive as we can get there's something about the outlet in the rivien that knows if you plug an ev charger into it so this has got me worried that maybe i can't plug in an e-bike charger let's go get an e-bike charger and a battery and let's just test that out just to be safe uh so we have here an electric electric bike an electric bike charger okay we might be a little too far apart here let's see says that it's charging so okay so an e-bike works and e-car does not work right i mean so the welder worked for a split second you know you were able to do a spot weld i was able to do a spot weld and it didn't seem it was going to die it's just too unreliable to be able to know that you can do it all the time it's probably because the peak current that it was going to draw is just too much but battery chargers work pretty much every power tool that we tried it worked you'd have to use one power tool at a time which i mean for one person it's not that big a deal but you're not gonna have a whole construction crew running off your truck i mean the only thing that bums me out is that i really thought you could trickle charge a car if you you know plugged in uh the rivian charged it at your cabin and then you want to charge from it for some reason i don't know why but yeah i don't know yeah if you went and visited somebody on the side of the road to give them a few miles but you can't it doesn't seem you can do it yeah but it doesn't seem you can do it we tried three different chargers and three different vehicles and it just didn't work yeah you certainly can't charge itself so definitely some wins we got up to what is level four or five in terms of uh in terms of nail guns yeah i mean you could you could conceivably run some nail guns for for small projects small projects where you only need to shoot a few nails right same thing with electrical i mean you can basically run up to 1500 watts yeah which is exciting yeah it's capability we haven't had and i mean i'm kind of impressed that if you do blow the breaker it's just a digital one you just change it on the screen yeah yeah well i think we did all the testing we could with the r1ts uh compressor and electrical system thank you so much for watching if you've got ideas on how we can test this even more put them in the comments down below we'll see you next time now you know,-1
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJl35aIy5pOVBHvoGgqavrdJ,TalYD7Z3QK8,thank you what are you doing well remember last time we reviewed the r1t's power situation the tools remember that well i'm a contractor and r1t didn't really cut it so i want to see if the forward lightning can actually be a job truck okay right because the the rivian r1t while it's really cool that it has power outlets and stuff that you can only pull about those 1100 1400 watts or something that and i mean that can run a lot of different things but it can't run everything not a job site and i mean it has an air compressor but it couldn't really run a nail gun yeah let's test it all out next on in depth [music] thank you to surfshark for sponsoring this surfshark is a vpn a virtual private network that keeps what you're doing

remember with the r1t it has 1500 watts of power which is great for little projects and i think we showed pretty well that you could go up to your cabin in the woods and do a little trim work or something that but i'm thinking if you're a contractor and you want to show up at a job site maybe the job site has no power right now can you actually run all the tools you need to run just with the truck and i want to see if that's possible okay so let's start out with uh this this is uh miter saw yeah this is something you can use a lot on the job it draws a lot of power around 1500 watts so that's a whole circuit i've got it plugged into the truck this is not plugged into the shop this is into the truck and it works just fine and that's running off of the ford's battery pack yeah and as we'll show you as we go uh we're going to be showing you a live screen of the power drawdown so you can see if this is real or not and what it's drawn because this is you know draws quite a bit of power and i mean you've used this for years and years and years i think this saw is about as old as you are i think i built the entire house with the sun awesome all right so i mean that's cool but what uh what else can we be doing with this all right well let's come on over here all right so you remember last time on the r1 t jesse it has a little compressor built in and we used it to show with it with some of these tools that you could do some little bit of brad nailing and maybe a finish nailer but it was really made just to pump up your tires exactly but i want to show you what you're really going to be using on a job site are these big air tools that use a lot of air a framing nailer yeah a siding nailer yep and if you want to keep going all day long you need a compressor so we're kind of cheating here the ford doesn't have its own compressor sure but most contractors are going to bring a compressor this compressor i'm going to plug into the 110 here okay and what i love about the ford is that instead of having to bring a whole power strip yeah it's got so many outlets one two three four outlets that are 110 and then a 220. so you got four outlets right here and there's more in the front and there's more oh there we go i mean i just want to point out while the compressor is running foreign nasty cut it's going that's something that would not work with the rivien r1c it's drawing 1800 watts all right so this is a you know real job compressor it's not a toy it usually i have this on a 20 amp circuit by itself even in the shop if i run this on that circuit with some other tool sometimes i blow the breaker yeah so when we just ran both of these tools that's a very real world situation that you'd have where you don't want your guy on the rooftop to stop because this turns on this was drawing 1800 watts while we were running it the r1t would not be able to handle that you can't draw that much from it no this would have and that's and that's why it was running sometimes when this thing starts up especially when it's cold it draws a lot more to get it going yeah so i'm really impressed so right there shows me that i could do pretty much small jobs yep i had two guys working at the same time but i think we should push it even further okay how do we do that well let's get even more tools running at the same time let's say you had a guy and you need to be doing some grinding and you had another guy need to be doing some sanding and you had a guy who was cutting and then this was on can that all work at the same time we blow it basically can we blow it exactly oh and while we're at it why don't we break some rocks okay so i pulled some bigger tools from the arsenal let's see if you can break some rocks well i do some framing start breaking rocks okay [music] blew it we did it we blew the breaker wow man that took a lot of work huh yeah i mean i had we had 1800 watts we had whatever this thing is we'll have to look that up yeah uh and then i was doing a grinder all right well let's see what the ford told us go see it's not telling me much did it i'm worried that we blew some actual physical fuses there might just be a reset on the uh outlets i feel that's what these are yeah i see it all right so i see what happened uh-huh there are physical circuit breakers right here that's what's inside these little bulbs you were you thought they were something i thought they was part of ford's hybrid generator system no so what it is is uh this is a break right here so i don't know if you can see but this one has not been blown that's from i believe this one down here i think what we blew is we have the compressor and the grinder on the same circuit okay and as you can see it's a 2.4 kilowatt max 20 amp and i think we just i said pulling 20 amps from this and that is too much so i'm going to push this in and reset it okay it worked all right zach so you know we were working on the truck and we blew the breaker oh hang on that's a 20 amp circuit which is the biggest circuit you're going to find in most houses and we would have blown that breaker and all we had to do is reset it that happens to me on job sites all the time oh with with houses yeah exactly so we didn't break the truck yeah we were just drawing too much on that one circuit we have multiple circuits in this truck that's true so we have two 110 circuits back here we have a few in the front and we have some in the cab oh and before we get to the front we have a 220 here and i think we have some tools in the shop that run on 220 so i thought it'd be cool idea to show how that works one of those tools is a welder now if you remember with the r1t we tried using a welder and we got a few sparks to fly but we couldn't get any meaningful welding done because we kept blowing it i think we should try out our serious heavy duty welder all right let's do some tig welding all right i can't believe i'm doing this but i'm welding off of a ford f-150 lightning um i got my tig welder here i don't know if the wind is necessarily good for tig welding but we're going to give it a shot anyway uh here we go [music] foreign [music] well less than ideal conditions because helmets aren't made to work in sunlight the welder worked great i was putting a pedal to the middle that's definitely the worst weld i've ever done but it did tack and i mean i didn't hear anything anything bad at all happening electrically yeah i mean it had nothing to do with the truck no no i mean you're supposed to be inside when you weld right and also we're in a rush but yeah i mean the thing never shut off yeah and i mean we're plugged into 220 that thing's drawing a lot of amps and that was pretty astounding zach what are you what are you getting now all right make a little room make a little room all right i figured 220 this is a 220 bandsaw okay so you want to make some [music] make some most job sites easily because it's i'd have to go find a 220 outlet we've got one right on the truck that's really cool all right let's try it out let's do it all right so if we're working on a job site and we need to do some fine you know bandsaw cutting a piece of spalted maple uh let's see if we can do it okay all right all right and this isn't don't try this at home kids use the proper level band saw but today we're going to try this out okay then when you're ready ready no way easy peasy man all right so i mean that worked yeah you know what we need to do next what we have another whole job compartment on this truck come on around to the front all right wait so we have been working in the bed of the truck using all of those circuits look at this control panel over here yeah we've got another four outlets here along with usb i mean what are we running off of this this is another 20 amp circuit yeah wow and uh we've got a bunch of battery chargers here yeah so imagine you pull up to your job site and very common nowadays you're going to have a lot of battery battery powered tools yep this would be a perfect place for them and you could even do some work here if you wanted to the cool part is if you if you've gotten everything kind of in a good spot and you're not going to be racing with it uh at the end of the day or actually you could leave it this all the time if you were working out on the street yep wait is this going to be charging while it's closed as long as the truck is on okay so that's the key part here is that you would have to leave the truck on but i mean most times you're going to be working near the truck so that means that i could leave my drills my batteries they're charging yeah you can take your lunch break or whatever and yeah let's say i'm using air tools for a while and i come back all i have to do is foreign pop the frunk and they're all here nice and safe waiting for me because this locks too yeah so i mean there's security there's all this extra space that you wouldn't have in a normal ice truck yeah and there's more room in here too right yeah there's a subfront got the sub front yeah you could store batteries down there yeah i'm feeling this is a serious work truck because you actually have different compartments and stuff yeah all right so i think we put this through its paces and my first thoughts are that this would be an awesome job truck yeah i mean we were able to do quite a bit of work um using just the bed outlets if you needed another 20 amp circuit you have the front a lot of power you can draw from this truck i think if you're not a contractor you may not understand how amazing this is it's it kind of changed my way of thinking normally you get to a job site you have to go find a bunch of outlets run extension cords into someone's house let's say you're doing an addition right you got to find extension cords run them through their living room out a window that takes half an hour in the morning to get set up then at the end of the job you gotta unpack and coil everything back up well with this truck you could just show up pretty much have everything ready to go pull your power from this pull your compressor lines from this get roofing get whatever you're doing immediately and at the end of the day everything's pretty much already in the truck so you don't have to go get all this stuff bring it back to the truck yeah i think this could actually save you half an hour to an hour every day which if you're a contractor you know how much money that is well and let's talk about generators let's say oh well i could do all of this off of a generator okay you have to first buy the generator you have to maintain it and fuel it every day that means you have to kind of go out of your way to fuel up your generator you have to go get the gasoline you got to bring the gas with you right with this the truck is using power directly on board and can we just talk about that point for a second in a lot of residential situations if you're running a generator all day you are pissing off the neighbors yeah you do not as a contractor want to piss off your neighbors because every now and then you need them on your side for something this way you can go and tell the neighbors hey look look how quietly i'm doing your job i am really impressed i think if you're a contractor you should really give this a second look i know the price on the ford f-150 lightning right now is a little pricey but maybe if you factor all these other factors in it may come to the point where it's hey this is really worth it i just love that they pulled out all the stops for this multiple outlets and multiple circ multiple circuits a lot of power i mean the 220 that means there's nothing you can't power that i can think of i know you could you could power a washing machines exactly we did a band saw we did a welder and i mean we could power our big cabinet saw off of it if we want it's true it's 30 amps of 220 that's a lot of power and as we're showing you here this thing can do this all day the battery pack is so big you don't have to worry that oh i can only do it for an hour you can do it for a full day yeah anyway super impressed with the ford f-150 this is why we bought the truck by the way didn't want to just have it and we couldn't get it dirty and had to give it back to ford in two days this is our truck we're getting it dirty we're using it for you so that we can tell you what this thing can really do if you want to head over to patreon.com right now you can support us for as little as a buck a month you'll get all of our patreon bonus stories and you'll be able to feel good that you're bringing this kind of content to the internet overall i think i can confidently say this is a brand new pickup truck for a brand new age you know i'm really excited to see what the tesla cyber truck can do and we have one on order we're very high on the waiting list for the cyber truck so as soon as we get that truck you're going to be seeing all these tools brought out again and see if we can run it off of that one yeah thanks so much for watching everybody now you know,0
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJl35aIy5pOVBHvoGgqavrdJ,_Rr2fFp1jzg,all right so zach told me to come see what we did in the truck uh what do we got look at my mobile studio wait what the is that a is it a screen yeah you got a computer we got everything you need in an office we got is this a coffee maker of course how are you gonna start your day without coffee we've got our editor in there yeah he's we're gonna prove that you can you know do all this work while you're driving around with starlink wait whoa wait hang on is that the computer with the 3080 in it what are you talking about that it's got a massive graphics card we're running all of this off oh yeah no this is legit this is showing that you can do the everything you need to do in an office i mean you can even make a cup of coffee look at that you're making an espresso and a ford why not look at the power we're drawing now huh 1260 watts that's a that's a lot of power and it can just handle it huh yeah i mean that's a computer coffee maker a lamp oh and the starlink wait we got oh gotta get them coughed up so we can get his work done what the [music] this episode is sponsored by surfsharkvpn surfshark is an app and browser

worry it's fully refundable we're in the middle of a parking lot yup uh we got starlink in the back yeah yep and then we have a computer yeah a big hunk and powerful desktop computer this isn't a little laptop and what we're going to do right now is put up on your screen what we're seeing live with the starlink data so you can see what we see in terms of what our data is looking so you're going to see that screen captured this is my proposal jesse is that you could have an office and be on the road in a ford f-150 lightning yeah with starlink as you can see we're plugged in to the ford and that's what's enabling this whole operation all right zach this is cool and all see it's cool you have little faith of little faith yeah i mean and this is called can we do it while we're driving i don't see why not but let's test it here we go now we're gonna keep up the data that you're seeing from starlink so you can see what actually happens as we get on the highway so far we haven't lost anything even though the starlink was pointed in a direction and we've just turned 180 degrees okay so we're going down this tree-lined street yeah but these are little trees they're not going to stop starlink think so oh i don't know well also we're making tons of turns because we're in a parking lot once we get on the highway i feel we're going to make very slight turns right yeah i don't think we've seen major outages yet so i mean this whole time we're doing it i want elliot pretending you know through gameplay or through watching videos that he's just doing work wait he can do he can play a game why not all right let's play some here i don't know why you're so surprised jesse i mean elon sent these to the ukraine right to help ukraine out and they're able to get their internet there we're here in the northeast and we should be able to get internet here ah yeah yeah i mean you're right we've only had little minor dropouts of stuff and i mean my argument would be that if you're doing kind of normal officey stuff you're facetiming with your your team or if you're doing spreadsheets or emails for the most part it wouldn't matter if you had little minor dropouts because those happen to everyone's wi-fi from time to time right mean that everything stops yeah i mean we've had a little minor wipeouts but that that hasn't stopped him from being able to watch the because the buffers we're getting on the highway now and as you know there's you know trees and sharp turns and all that right but you know i'm dying to see what happens maybe when we go too fast it just won't work i mean radio waves are pretty fast i don't see why i wouldn't work but i just meant tracking the satellites it's working i mean this is crazy it's actually working i mean and this is with starlink just screwed down to a piece of plywood in the back of a pickup truck right i didn't take a lot of time to figure any of this out right so i mean we're on the highway it looks we've maybe had another little dip but nothing substantial we're still playing the whole back there you know what i'm wondering yeah can we go to the next level could you have gaming because in gaming in certain kinds of games the ping rates important right no dropouts you can't buffer a game or at least in an online multiplayer game i feel you should start playing a hard game all right what do we got let's play some counter-strike counter-strike that's that's pretty serious uh game does does steam starlink that's the question it's not good yeah apparently all right we're on the highway now we're going 65 on the highway no way number 65 on the highway here's you're seeing the cameras and just to we're online we're going under this little sign over the highway i wonder if that makes a big difference or not i don't know we're coming up to an overpass oh yeah this is our first overpass uh i don't know dude i don't think it's gonna work you don't think it's gonna you think we're gonna just lose it entirely well i mean it's a big block of concrete and steel of course we're only going under for a second though uh okay all right we just went under it what happened uh okay i'm seeing a little a little drop out but nothing substantial i mean i guess you're right we're only in front of it for a second i can't i can't really wrap my head around i know here's another overpass coming up i think two actually two and two back to back okay this is gonna be see this is where i just think wait you think we're gonna lose it entirely and never get it back no i mean it has to track satellites and do all sorts of stuff you're you're getting you're cutting in front of the sky here let's see okay how's the counter strike coming is it working yes see if you can handle a game ready to start gaming yeah i hope getting his getting his headphones on this is serious serious gaming are you kidding me and i mean on the phone here it says we have a latency of 38 milliseconds that's it did you get a kill yeah what i think is this the first kill under starlink in a ford f-150 lightning it has to be oh and by the way we're in blue cruise we're doing all the tech at once here so you could have been playing counter-strike yourself well i wouldn't condone that no just knocking don't play counterstrike in the back of the truck so elliot are there are there real humans playing or not uh mostly boss but yeah there are some humans there are some guys i mean the best part of this just everyone the best part is that jesse didn't believe me and that we're proving that it can be done because he did not think that we could pull this off even sitting in in a parking lot let alone look i thought the parking lot i just thought the computer plus the you know he's got a lamp back there and a coffee maker i'm just saying this is 65 ping that's pretty good that's pretty good elon thank you yeah this is amazing i mean this is uh my ride level oh yeah this is a full gaming computer that draws a lot of power first of all actually we can check yeah uh let me see what we're what we're pulling here he's pulling 430 watts roughly 420. nice first human kill yeah i think that's a record internet and look at we're in new england look at the big trees on either side of this highway i mean i could get over one lane which would put us even more in the middle i don't know if that would help i don't know either and by the way we're going uh 69 miles an hour nice and we're drawing 420 watts just saying just saying another overpass coming up in about five seconds see here's the overpass this brings about a whole new level of gaming if you have to take into account starlink outages yeah so quick run for cover we're about to lose internet but i mean how long did he lose it i don't think i noticed anything i mean the game didn't say anything kind of lagging for three seconds so an overpass is three seconds of lag i mean that's not bad it's not bad especially i'm going slow ish i'm going 62 because of this truck so jesse i think i've proven my point about being on the highway what i'm gonna do now because i think realistically they're going to be times if you're running your your office from the road that you're going to have to get onto non-highway situations so i'm going to get onto a you know 45 mile an hour kind of road situation okay uh with leaves on trees and let's see what happens to our mobile office okay all right so we're coming up to what i would consider to be a lot more tree yeah i mean we're going to take a 90 degree turn we're going to have trees i feel he's gonna just stop he's gonna get totally laggy and keep in mind my premise wasn't to have a mobile office where you can play live multiplayer games my premise was that you would be able to do office stuff um so far we're good oh wow we're still on yeah and i mean we're right underneath some tall trees and a power line i'm just astounded that starlink can track because because also don't forget normally starlink is mounted to a surface a you know a building and now we're just in this mobile thing that's bouncing all around right you got to hand it to the startup link engineers i mean this is incredible i mean there's definitely little tiny dropouts but they're not even affecting his game did you win nope oh that's too bad all right another 90 degree turn okay yeah i mean i'm still curious to see we've got kind of open skies here yeah but i'm curious to see if you can still kind of game because i mean look what i'm what we're proving here with the game isn't that you can game i want to make that clear we're proving that if you can actually do a multiplayer game and play it kind of fun that means everything else on a computer works because if you know about computers gaming is one of the hardest things to do on a computer right so i can hear some of you watching right now you're saying zach what are you talking about how could you do work you know it's one thing to do work from home or do work in the office but but you're talking about doing work in a mobile office right and i guess my point is not that you would exactly set it up the way we have my thought would be more you'd be pulling a camper and then during the day you would be moving to your next site and so for the most part you probably wouldn't be doing it from the road but if you had to if you're well today we got to push on to the next site and i gotta get some meetings done right you could do it from the back seat of the truck well and the other thing too is uh let's say that you had it in your camp upper and there was a power source in there and you want it to be downloading or uploading footage you could have your computer running because obviously you can't have a person in the camper but you could leave your computer running to download or upload hundreds of gigabytes of files and it would just be doing it really good point i mean that's really cool for a lot of people yeah i just think right now we have proven something huge here we are not using a latest generation starlink this is one of the first starlinks yeah and we are on some of the worst conditions of roads i think because we're in new england with big trees if you're out in the midwest for instance or most other places in the us for instance there's not a lot of big trees and so you've got just open sky all right so how are we doing now that we're very tree covered well we're still doing okay but a lot worse than oh yeah look there's ghosting yeah we're at 86 81 right now yeah and i'm seeing some dropouts on the on the phone here and now we're going to be going over it looks two oh overpasses we're going to be going pretty slowly probably only about 30-ish miles an hour so we'll have to see how that impacts you here we go you're about to lose it should get it back oh that was so weird i saw you totally drop out for a minute but it comes right back i mean that's really cool how fast does it come right back a second yeah pretty much wow so as you can see we're driving along in a mix of trees we have moments where it's really covered we have moments where it's open and i think this is a really good example of what would be a kind of a bad almost worse case if you're trying to do work in the truck because look i mean we have trees that are just overhanging the road completely so i'm sure it must block it completely and then we have little spots where it's open i doubt it can get any internet during those times i mean look at this completely shaded now i can't believe that he's going to have any coverage right now and i think this is really good data this shows you that if you can kind of plan your route and pick routes that don't have just tons and tons of trees okay now we're going to hit an open spot and we'll see if he gets anything back how's it been going um not so good the hardest part here is to aim because it's shaking oh you mean physically the car shaking yeah wait so it's not even necessarily the lag it's just the physical being in a truck yeah [laughter] elliot can somehow do this without getting car sick i would definitely be car sick by now so i'm not arguing that you would do this constantly but you could do a facetime is what i'm arguing because a lot of times you can just have it facing you and not have to look right at the camera the whole time or i mean you could be on your phone i mean i know that you can have lte in most of the civilized world but there are lots of stretches in the world where you're not going to have that luxury i mean i was in uh vermont the other day and just had absolutely no cell coverage whatsoever right and it's kind of scary because you're well if i need to call someone or if i need uh to look something up of you know a charger or a destination having the starlink is be pretty nice i'm a 200 ping right now it's not really working okay so now we're starting to get into the failure points oh yeah it's looking great looking real good but you know another point here is not just office let's say you want to just go on a little weekend getaway but you want to be able to bring you know netflix with you into your campground or something and we've had this experience we went camping and there was just not enough wi-fi at the campsite and so you want to bring starlink with you well here we're kind of proving you can just throw it in the back of the truck or throw it in the back of whatever and just when you're ready put it on the roof but the campsite had better be pretty wide open because here here we are you know driving through these trees and there's a lot of downtime sure i think that i think that elliot's given up at this point um yeah thanks so much for watching now you know we work hard to bring you videos about things that we think you'll find useful but we need to know from you what you want to see so leave your comments below also don't forget to go over to our patreon page where for as little as a buck a month you can watch our patreon bonus story every week on tesla time news thanks again we'll see you soon,-1
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJl35aIy5pOVBHvoGgqavrdJ,cXZBZWcgAJI,oh how you doing pretty good yeah you know i've been into electric since 1979. 1979 i mean there weren't that many electric cars back then oh no no i'm not talking electric cars i'm talking electric guitars oh yeah that's when i started playing and uh guess what i'm playing this one on the lightning what [music] we want to thank birch living for sponsoring the show birch is a premium mattress and a box company that makes mattresses and sleep products that are stylish comfortable and environmentally conscious and it's that last part the environmentally conscious part that really first got my attention because birch makes organic non-toxic mattresses made right here in america with just four materials sourced straight from nature organic latex new zealand wool american steel springs and organic cotton yeah i've been sleeping on my birch mattress for over a year now and i love it for two big reasons what's the first reason well first of all it's super comfortable and i know it's comfortable because when i went on vacation this year i was sitting up late at night in my hotel room wishing i was back on my birch mattress wow you think a hotel could get it right and that was a nice hotel too look you're going to spend about a third of your life in bed and for me i want a mattress that's made out of organic and natural materials exactly birch is certified global organic textile standard green guard gold fair trade eco institute certified wool integrity new zealand forest stewardship council i mean it's made sustainably and that's important to us and birch living just introduced their newest mattress the birch luxe natural mattress deluxe takes the comfort and luxury of the original birch mattress to the

pillows those pillows by the way are made from recycled plastic bottles wow so uh you got your little guitar ramp i was thinking about this right if you're a one-man band or you know two duet or something you can just put your equipment in the back back it up to wherever you're doing a fair or a farmer's market or whatever and just start playing you don't to haul it all onto some stage drag out your extension cords all that stuff you've got the power right here yeah i just don't know if you know a little amp this is gonna you know cut it i thought about that i think the ford f-150 lightning is actually a musician's best friend all right well you're gonna have to prove it to me i'm gonna prove it to you right now [music] so uh yeah jesse i think this proves that you can have a rock band in a ford f-150 lightning yep we got a pa system yep we got a full drum kit yep got a guitar amp yep i mean what more do you need we can do lights we can do there's so much there's so much more power let me just see how much we're drawing right now i mean we're only pulling a couple hundred watts right i mean there's not much power here and the other thing i want to point out is we have a green room come with me so this truck comes complete with a green room as well jesse here is my sound engineer yeah we're plugged in with the amp right here um controlling all the volumes and stuff that so we could turn it up to 11. the numbers all go to 11. because we have the power let me just show you in the front here so i mean uh we're actually using quite a bit of power it's 720 watts it's a guitar amp and a pa yeah but we have so much more to use we could do a fog machine we could do lights yeah so i mean we could go up to 2400 watts yeah out of out of just one of the circuits and we have three circuits and these two circuits go up to 3 600 watts i mean you could get a crank and sound system you could have subwoofers yeah you could have basically a battle of the band oh my god simultaneous band battle of the bands with with different lightnings so uh there you have it rock on thank you ford all right zach so we got to the worst part of the night time to break down everything pack it all up except wait a minute what look where all the stuff is it's already in the trunk already in the truck baby wait so we can just drive it down to the studio uh pretty much we got to do a little bit of consolidation but uh i mean this was our stage we can fold that up let's do it pretty much ready to go let's do it before we do though i just want to point out one thing now you see this i was kind of using it as a stage right not very big not very big but if i really was in a rock band right now i would build an extension stage i don't know what out of you that probably plywood or something that would come in panels out as far as i want with some little legs right and i could grow this back part of the truck into an actual stage yeah and then you could move the speakers out to there give the drummer a little bit more room yeah have room for uh another guitarist to bassist you could probably fit a four piece band in the back with this extendo stage extendo stage trademark oh and you know what else you'd have yeah rock on from all the way back here so your lead singer could be over there and i could have the mic right back here that could be your mc hello ladies and gentlemen i'll see you later i got a couple more ideas since i just started doing this my brain is um aftermarket things so this thing perfect to hold the drink for the lead singer or uh his iphone or whatever true right all sorts of things that you could make to make this work better my extendo stage idea uh which is too bad it's already trademarked trademark um and then the last thing i was thinking of we just put a rock band back here but if you were doing karaoke dj dj so many things because if you want to just show up in an event normally you have to haul a big generator which is the whole time loud and slinky stick that somewhere away you got to bring extension cords and let me talk to you about extension cords for one second people don't think about this every time you run an extension cord yep tripping tripping hazard and you're losing amps yeah and amps is rock juice you have i don't even know how many amps we're talking in this truck right now i'm sure there's some people who have crazy sound systems that might need 220. we have 220. yep this is so exciting to be able to have all of this coming out of a truck all right well let's pack it up and bring down the studio and show that we've already done the work exactly wait jesse uh the bed's kind of full where we're gonna put the samp uh good thing we have a frunk so you know play that funky music there we go we'll load this foot too oh no way you could fit a whole guitar i mean with case i bet yeah if that were in a case it would fit uh let's close it up no guitars were hurt in the filming of this yeah that's nice too i mean that's another whole thing you could do you could have your little concert here in your in your front a front concert if you're a frunk band all right ladies and gentlemen if you would follow the red truck we will be going to the second stage for this evening's entertainment that's right ladies and gentlemen the band is moving to another location but we don't have to stop the music if we don't want to we're gonna take this show on the road [music] well i'd say that was a success that was a major success and hey if you want to help us out you know this takes a lot of work yeah we had to you know dust off the old drum set all the all the speakers and everything now we gotta uh pack it all back up but you can't say we don't test things i mean when we say we're going to test these trucks we are testing them fully so if you want to help us do that head on over to patreon.com now you know for as little as a buck a month you get to see all of our patreon bonus stories and uh it helps support us do this kind of work i mean it is work thanks so much for watching now you know we work hard to bring you videos about things that we think you'll find useful but we need to know from you what you want to see so leave your comments below thanks again we'll see you soon,0
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJl35aIy5pOVBHvoGgqavrdJ,JUza0fG6y0k,[music] [applause] thank you [music] what are you doing here what are you doing here i'm charging my truck i'm going to be charging mine foreign this charger ain't got enough amps for the two of us we'll stand back because i'm about to plug in my truck's the fastest charge in this side of the mississippi there's only room enough here at this charger for one of us buckos so it looks we have here a good old-fashioned charge off i suppose so next on in depth [music] foreign [music] the sneaker that's 100 vegan at lunch the other day i was looking around at everyone's feet and i saw that everyone on the crew was wearing their vessies yeah it's no wonder i mean they're so comfortable they're wearing slippers i think one of the things people always best about them is that they're waterproof i hear so many stories about people wearing vessies in the rain through puddles and how their feet stay dry yeah that's because vessi's lightweight breathable mesh fabric is also waterproof which is so nice not having to worry about wet socks again they've got so many different styles that you'd never find a waterproof shoe in yeah i love that my vestes just slip on fast but look so good and the reason we're talking about sneakers on a that's all about sustainability is because the textile industry is one of the largest contributors to water pollution in the world and vesius cut traditional machine knit times from 45 minutes to 7 minutes which reduces each pair's carbon footprint by over 600 percent and even more than the comfort style or waterproof fabric i chose bessie's because they're trying hard to be more sustainable so if you're looking for a new pair of sneakers give besties a try you get free exchanges and free returns so you have 90 days to decide if you them on the link in the description and use our code now you know to get 25 off your vessi shoes all right so we find ourselves at an ea charger here with the ford f-150 the rivian we're ready to go what's your state of charge uh 13 what's yours me too i as we were driving i got us to the same so we are ready to go let's go plug in and see who wins in this charge off all right let's do it [music] so guess what jesse uh that charger the 350 that we need is not working yes so uh we've just driven up here we have no juice left because we're miles and miles from home so what are we gonna do instead of doing a fun charge off thanks a lot of electrify america your other 350 charger is not working this is the closest 350 charger by the way it's 50 miles away from our house yeah electrify america yeah this is first of all big ding on both these trucks these are the networks that these trucks have to deal with oh and by the way we're being kind of iced by a kona who's taking a 350 kilowatt charger even though he can't use 350 kilowatts he could be plugged into a 150 we can use the 350 but we can't it's very frustrating so anyway in a few minutes when this kona leaves we're going to be able to charge one truck and then we're going to be able to charge the other one i really wanted to bring you a nice fun where we plugged them both in at the same time and we're running between the trucks unfortunately we're just not going to be able to do that today you'll still get all your science your data but it won't be as fun as we planned certainly not as fun for us because we're gonna have to be here twice as long [music] i started the app a couple minutes ago it says initiating charging but it hasn't done anything i haven't plugged in yet all right here we go here we go he's plugged in 1233 p.m connecting to vehicle okay initiating charging okay all right this is the ford f-150 that we're charging up at 12 33 pm still says initiating charge here we go 32 cents a minute and what's your state of charge at the moment 11 error we're unable to start your charge check that your correct charger and your vehicle is plugged in uh start the charge again through your app okay i love electrify america great just love it just great awesome swipe to charge processing payment initiating charging doesn't make you feel good no my app says initiating charging it says plug in first okay plugged it in connecting to vehicle initiating charging although we got this far before so i don't know [music] welcome driver initiating charging it says that it's fast charging do you have any kilowatt numbers no still isn't showing anything here [music] charge error are you shooting me although i hear something yeah let's let's wait for a second here yeah i hear this revving up i have more range now we have more range yeah the range went up i'm up to 12 now but this says it's not charging it is charging it is charging it it is it's just not really telling me much there's no screen on there that gives you what's going in um maybe i need to stop it i don't know let's see oh here we go it's showing 13 156 kilowatts all right so the good news is that we're at a 350 kilowatt charger it appears that the ford is pulling 155 156 oh 157 kilowatts it took us about five minutes to get the charge actually going but we're going to count it from 12 36 we're at 13 to start we're now at 14 and we're gonna see how long it takes to get to 80 all right so we have been getting up to about 160 kilowatts and of course this is at a 20 state of charge so i do expect this to drop over time but overall that is 150 plus for sure i would definitely call that one 150 plus is it going to beat the rivian i don't think so i'm really interested to see what the curve rate is yeah as we get further into this up around 50 is it going to drop how fast it's going to drop really cool all right so it's been 10 minutes and uh what it looks we're up to 162 kilowatts we are at 34 and we're still uh humming along oh whoa hey oh it almost hit 165. i think that's because the battery's warming up oh we hit 165. nice so i'm really happy with ford at that rate let's hope it stays at that for a while we've already put 30 kilowatt hours into the battery it's been 11 minutes and we're up to 35 state of charge all right so some pretty weird stuff that we're seeing here it seems to be going all the way down to 132-ish kilowatts and then jumping up to 150. up now we're happy at 133. so blinking you miss it yeah so basically we've hit i think an inflection point in the curve so right around 39 ford has to slow down the charge rate basically don't overheat the battery but it did it in a really weird way basically it was it was you know coming down to 135 then jumping back up to one 60 and then dropping back down and doing a weird sawtooth pattern now it seems to have stabilized at around 133 kilowatts so i don't know that's interesting i do want to point out for filling the tank this much look how little we spent on electricity four dollars and fifty cents it is so much cheaper than gasoline so when we started we had a range of around 26 miles we're now up to 118 so we gained about 75 miles for four bucks that's a good price all right so thankfully we're at 50 state of charge which means we can at least make it home it's been hovering around 135 kilowatts this whole time that starts to build uh this part of the charge curve um we're gonna you know keep watch over it closely and uh keep you posted if anything changes all right so we're at 57 and we're just starting to see the taper now and you can see it's bright sunlight uh we were at 135 it's now started to uh trickle down we're at 128. it's trending on its way down the charge curve is going to change depending on a lot of different factors i'm assuming but it is going to vary a little bit but this gives us kind of a broad charging curve all right so we're now at 66 state of charge um it looks it's it's sloping pretty linearly down as we go although at 66 so two-thirds full and uh still a pretty high state of charge it's definitely not the 160 that we started at but uh um not the worst charge curve in the world all right so we're up to 72 percent state of charge and we're dropping the kilowatts pretty quickly here we're down to 102. i think we're going to hit 100 before we hit 75 percent state of charge all right so uh yeah as predicted we're below 100 kilowatts now 73 state of charge it's taken us 36 minutes to get 82 kilowatt hours and we obviously still have some some kilowatters to get pretty good uh price though of electricity all right so we're at 78 state of charge and we're at 78 kilowatts it has been slowly declining what i'm curious to see is if once we hit 80 we're going to drop this down to 20 kilowatts or something it's basically something that the ford machi does so the truck now has 241 miles of range which is pretty good i mean i think in most circumstances i would probably be ready to roll out by this point 40 minutes is plenty of time to get a snack go to the bathroom walk around the question is if i were to let it sit for a little bit longer would it be worth it or would i just be wasting my time so we're going to see about that in just a few seconds all right so we've hit 80 state of charge and we're dropping we dropped pretty quickly from about 70 to 58. it's it's holding there for now but i i have an inkling that it's going to drop a little bit further past this point all right so we've made it to 82 percent state of charge and we've been pretty consistent at 58 kilowatts now i do want to point out that 58 kilowatts is about 17 percent of the total amount of power that this unit could put out it didn't drop down to anything super duper low and we've gotten almost 95 kilowatt hours of electricity in 46 minutes i think that we're going to call it there because i just don't think that anyone would normally be sticking around much longer than this it's really not the point of a fast charger to charge slowly it's really just supposed to get you from point a to point b as quickly as possible and charging at 58 kilowatts is not something that is very quick all right we're going to call it there we did it now it's time for the rivian [music] all right starting up the electrified america app we're at charger number three swipe to charge not saying anything in particular should i plug in uh uh yeah why not who knows what you're supposed to do don't make it clear or anything they certainly don't all right so it's a 12 state of charge on the ravian so just one percent difference from the ford we're going to do a little math to subtract that out so we're doing a fair i doubt it's going to make a difference i do too i think i think the arabian's gonna clobber the ford let's see what's going on here okay let's not listen to it if it tells us to unplug because yeah it's initiating it's initiating i'll check in here let's see all right looks we're good here it's giving us a welcome driver screen which is always good it's starting it says it's starting in the ribbon that's good okay it says that it's charging now i'm guessing that we're gonna pull around 210 but it'll be interesting to see uh the the highest i've seen by anyone on the forums is 212. okay and if anyone was going to get it i think we could get it because we're such a low state of charge yep it's shooting up past 1 30 right now 150 168. we're already beating the ford 170 180 190 okay we hit 194. so that's quite a bit quicker than the ford at any point during its charging funny just to notice that it's saying we have a charge error again if i was listening to this i would have unplugged by now but we're actually charging so they've their software is just a piece of literally a piece of yeah now rivian is telling us that in order to get to 85 state of charge it'll only take 24 minutes really that would be a 20 minute faster 20 minutes faster it's claiming that we'll be done at 1 51. so according to this we're pulling 195. this is saying 198 and we're at a 15 state of charge now it's kind of amazing to think that it thinks in 20 minutes or so it will be at 80 percent state of charge why are you we're five minutes in and it still says that we have a charge error so if i was if i had walked off to go to the mall i'd be rushing back right now you know dropping spilling my drink i know to get back here to fix the problem that there is no problem oh we almost hit 201 baby all right so we're at 202 kilowatts 21 state of charge did you notice this machine's gotten louder i've been in the truck so i haven't i just noticed as i walked over it's even louder than when we started it's really working hard yeah it says that we're going to be done by whoa it's bouncing all over the place when it thinks we're going to be done charging it just it just went up to 28 minutes yeah math we started and it said it would take 24 minutes and it's been three minutes now it says it's going to take 28 minutes we hit 205 in the truck 205 yeah and we're at 28 state of charge but now it says slower while battery is cooling uh-oh slower while battery's cooling oh i don't the sound of that slower well battery is cooling it's at 205 i mean that's really good i'm confused i'm a bit confused i'm confused too but we're still pulling at a much higher rate than the ford did that was exciting i wonder you know if we're actually going to be 10 minutes faster than the ford or 15 minutes faster than the ford originally this said would be 20 minutes faster than the ford right we're at 33 state of charge pulling 204 at the charger i am really surprised that we got that far into the charge curve that high up that's really good vivian i will give you that that is really good all right we're at 209 kilowatts this is the highest it's been we're at 38 state of charge oh it's dropped it's dropped to 206 205. 204 202 yeah we're coming back down yeah we're coming down it's bumped back up to 200 over here oh yeah we're at 198 now so we went back up that's 199 200 203 208 we're at 211. that's the 211 212. 212 kilowatts that's the fastest we've been charging 209 kilowatts at 44 state of charge some kind of weird blip happening here nuts 213 213. we're winning we have the highest i've heard of we win take that everyone that is the highest i've heard of so far 2 13. we got the fastest charging in the east i'm a little worried to be sitting in this truck i know right the whole battery beneath you the double stacked battery is heating up as we speak okay it's dropped down now but we were at 2 2 13. wow i can't believe that elon these are the numbers to beat by the way i guess they are all right so we're at 58 state of charge we've just had a massive dip we've been around 170 kilowatts up until this point we've just dropped to about 150. this is about where ford was at peak except that we're at nearly a 60 state of charge now riven estimates that we're going to be here for another 10 minutes which is not quite what it originally told us slowed down quite a bit in terms of charge rate we're at 161 miles and 59 today charge so basically way faster charging rates with rivian through a huge chunk of that curve we were pulling at about 200 kilowatts and then it dropped down to about 180 um and now we're at a new plateau of about 150. i think that we're actually onto a taper now we're at 122 kilowatts at 67 state of charge so i think that this is more of a smooth taper uh i think than than even the ford all right so we just had a huge drop off we had been hovering around 120 kilowatts now we've dropped down to 80. now we're down to 70 69. it seems this is uh kind of the taper that were that i was uh sort of expecting to see so yeah we just dropped another huge amount we're down to 50 50 kilowatts at 72 percent state of charge yeah we've dropped significantly all right i think that at this point unless you were at a restaurant you would be saying all right time to go 37 kilowatts is just nothing even the ford was pulling you know 50 or 56 kilowatts at 80 state of charge so real tortoise in the hair situation here all right so a pretty nice recovery here back up to 70 kilowatts at 77 state of charge i don't know why it had dropped to 30 kilowatts for a while definitely not the 213 that we're pulling earlier but uh i mean this is what you expect this is what a taper charge is this is how batteries work yeah this literally is taking pretty much the same as the ford and ford took 46 minutes to get to 80. sure but we're at 39 minutes we're down to 55-ish kilowatts at 80 state of charge we're gonna go to 83 percent and then we're are going to finally be out of here it's been about 40 minutes charging so it's been around the same as the ford which is really weird and i think it's been this 70 to 80 percent state of charge that took the longest i really think that if we pulled out at 70 percent state of charge with both trucks that the riven would have won hands down now i think it's going to be a bit more of a wash all right we're getting near the end here it's 81 state of charge we've been here for 41 minutes and we're down to 52 kilowatts so uh we're about to unplug well we are about to unplug the reason that we go past 80 is that 80 is usually this magic number where we see a staggering drop off and we did see that with the rivian we didn't really see that with the four here i mean you're going to see this graph it's just all over the place it's all over the place i think this is the case of the tortoise and the hair rivian really was smoke in the ford all the way up to 70 state of charge and they took another and then just took a nap and the ford kept you know plugging along at 80 kilowatts or whatever while the rivian was doing 30. yeah if we had gone up to 70 state of charge which may you might want to consider doing now with the rivian yeah you'd saved a lot more time uh this 10 state of charge that we got wasted time let's get back home and look at the numbers and wrap this up all right all right so we just saw a lot of data it's hard to understand and we've just put it into two graphs which i think are going to really help us all understand what just happened because i was actually surprised by the data me too all right so the first chart we're looking at here this is ford versus rivian ford and red rivian and blue and we're looking at what we're looking at the number of kilowatts that the charger was delivering to the vehicle over our charge cycle okay so time at the bottom and kilowatts on the y-axis yes so what are we seeing here just spout out for us all right so this is the age-old story of the tortoise and the hair oh is that what this is uh basically yeah so the rivian starts out about 25 or 20 percent faster than the ford yeah it's getting over 200 kilowatts right and so when we started i was ravian's gonna win i think the arabian's gonna clobber the ford so then we keep going there is a bit of a you know couple of weird little things that happened and then 25 minutes in yeah rivian just starts tanking in terms of charge speed drops all the way to 30 kilowatts at one point um and we weren't even close to full then it rebounded and then it kind of went back down so this is where my high school calculus is really coming in i didn't think i'd ever use it but now i'm using it because what we're looking at here is area under the curve and if you look at the beginning of this rivian has all that difference between the red and the blue and then at 25 minutes loses all loses all of it so it's not they're not equal but what we're going to see in this next chart is what kind of well it's an easier way to look at it i think this chart same thing rivian in blue ford and red but this time we're doing state of charge over time so explain this so this is what we actually measured during our charge cycles we were sitting there with cameras just being okay it's been 10 minutes and this is the state of charge this is actual data that we got and as you can see it's kind of interesting how much of a not difference there is between these two trucks now it's a little bit deceiving because you know at 25 minutes the rivian is nearly at 70 percent and the ford is still stuck in the 50s obviously this was the the point in time where the rivian had done the most amount of charging and then it started to tank and that's why the ford starts to catch up in the graph i mean that first graph that we showed it looked the rivian was taking a huge lead and while it did take a lead it didn't take a massive lead what i want to point out is that both the batteries on these trucks are very similar in term they're only four kilowatt hours different so we can kind of almost eliminate that as a factor the only other factor that really matters here now i think because we're showing that they pretty much charge at the same speed is the efficiency of each truck and so that's something we're going to be testing going forward is you know which truck gives you more miles per kilowatt hour but i've got to say i thought that we were going to have hands down rivie and winner and i mean i think we should still claim rivian as the winner of this charge off but it was not by a mile it was by a very small margin yeah i mean now obviously there's going to be several factors that could lead to the differences i mean we charge the rivian second at this particular charger thanks a lot electrify america for ruining our scientific tests um so we were using the same charger but we used it in a back-to-back two 40-minute cycles so this charger was sitting there for oh you think it could have over overheated the charger or something could have been the charger for all we know um we have to be scientific here and unfortunately many more data points part of that is admitting that we only have one data point and this data point took us several hours to gather and so you know yeah it could have been that the rivian wasn't overheating it could have been that the charger was overheating um it could have been that the sun came out and that affected the data as well right as you can see it's uh not as astounding as you think it would be just based off of the numbers that have been coming out the peak kilowatt charge ratings and the other thing is though that these are computers on wheels it is possible that either brand could improve their charge time maybe they were just watching to get some data and make sure their safety factors were okay and so maybe ford will send it over their update probably not um that will change their charge curve and maybe you're looking at this and you're going actually i'm glad that rivian started to dip um once it got to a higher state of charge because i don't want it to destroy its battery over the lifespan of my truck i would rather be leaving with about 70 state of charge it was a weird curve let me just tell you at the bottom there let's look at chart one again um it seems it died way too quick and then tried to rebound almost it wasn't getting good temperature data from the battery or something so it was being super safe and then it was oh i don't have to be this safe so it's you know it's possible on another charge cycle that we would have gotten a different curve i think this is proof that adam savage was right he said remember kids the only difference between screwing around in science is writing it down and yeah we took a lot of measurements we wrote it down and made these charts otherwise it would have been two guys saying i don't know who won but we got the data for you right and the only reason we got the data for you let me just tell you is because of you our patreons if you want to support this and the fun crazy science that we do because look this is

first order don't put it off go to keps.com now you know and get 50 off your first order all right so i know what you guys are thinking you're going you got the world's first what so let's take a step back we've been reviewing a lot of different e-scooters and e-bikes winter came and it gets cold up here in new england and uh snowy and we couldn't take the e-bikes the e-scooters out we were all bummed and uh well i think one day one of us said to the other one can we just ride him on snow and uh well we found out the hard way you can't right and then it was can't we just put a track you know can't can't we just turn it into a snowmobile so i mean i went online and did some research because i thought well someone's definitely done this before and we'll just copy them and i found out that while i did find a couple snow scooters that were powered by gasoline i didn't find any that were electric so we were able to get some ideas from those other scooters but basically we had to start kind of from scratch right now there's no products out there there's no snow scooter that you can buy unless it's it does no tires but for the most part i don't think you're going to find anything that's going to truly traverse snowy conditions so we decided that we would uh just make it the problem was uh there's a couple hurdles we had to overcome and we want to tell you how we did it so the first one was we had to figure out how to attach some kind of contraption to the back of a scooter that could hold a track and zach and i have lots of experience uh zach is a licensed contractor i've worked with him before so we've built houses we've uh we've done all sorts of different things we've used bolts and nuts before and i mean you worked at desktop metal where you guys had to you know invent things 3d printed actual metal so it seemed this was something we could do but we got to this one sticky part we found out that the frame of the scooter we wanted to use and by the way we're using the mercane wide wheel and that's because it has a wide wheel which will make sense in a minute that scooter many others is made out of a aluminum frame and there just was not enough room to go sticking bolts through things we didn't want to drill holes and just try and bolt stuff on so we decided it was time to learn a new skill welding welding right and the problem is we had already learned how to weld using what's called mig welding and so we have a steel mig welder and technically you could convert it to an aluminum mig welder we tried that didn't really work right our first tests didn't really work we put some mig aluminum wire in there and yeah it didn't work it and it really wouldn't work and we learned why later when we went to the next step and we got ourselves a tig welder and so i just want to stop at this point and say i think this is a skill now that we've learned this skill that you guys should at least consider learning yourselves because it used to be just a decade ago that just the machines to do this were wildly expensive we're talking 35 000 for a decent tig machine and let's be honest most of them weren't decent most of them were great because the only people who were going to be tig welding were going to be professionals super professionals which okay so i guess for the hobbyist welders you're gonna have to stick with the the stick welding but let me explain the problem we need to stick basically just these little blocks of aluminum onto our aluminum frame to give us a place to bolt on a steel frame and just to do that we had to do aluminum tig welding so we found for 850 bucks a tig welder and it turns out to be an awesome tig welder that allows you to not only do aluminum but steel stainless steel copper titanium just about any metal you want and you know we did our research on this we watched a thousand youtube videos i'm sure that you've if you've ever learned anything recently you've watched a thousand youtube videos about it and yeah so we decided this was the welder we were gonna go for a huge shout out by the way to the fabricator series yes right because that youtube he is amazing uh he taught us basically everything we needed to know yeah uh and so we set out to uh you know acquire an argon bottle which was less scary than we thought it was going to be right because i mean i'll be honest what stopped me before from going tig because we love you know watching martin over on the wintergatan where he tig welds his beautiful marble machine but the fact that you have to include a gas with it i was oh gas is it is it dangerous is it part of some weird subscription to a membership to a some kind of a gas thing turns out at least in our neck of the woods i know that in different countries it's different but in our neck of the woods uh we went down to a welding supply place we said hey we want a a smallish bottle of argon and they said sure and you pay for it and you get to take it home right you you can just rent it basically it's seven bucks a month where we are for the bottle and um you know whatever the argon was i think in this case 20 bucks yeah and so for not much money you could be on the road to welding with argon which is what we did getting kind of hot so i'll get back to the shop did some practicing made a few mistakes here and there during our practice but basically after a while you got really good at it my eyesight isn't really great at using a welding helmet and my glasses and stuff so i mean i practiced you did but when it got to doing the actual welding jesse did the welding and i think that we can find you some glasses that could help you yeah no i think if i put more time into it um big tip here we had been using just regular welding helmets that are you put them on the world is dark don't do that get get yourself a welding helmet that will turn on when you start welding it's going to make a heck of a difference for those for the seasoned welders out there i completely understand you are a machine i understand but for if you're learning knowing where everything's going to be and then you start welding it's so useful so we did a whole bunch of prep work cleaned off all the paint and the powder coat and everything off of the areas that we were going to weld we got ourselves some big blocky chunks of aluminum that we were basically going to bolt the steel frame to now you can't weld steel to aluminum so that we did need to bolt it um but we we needed something else besides the the crummy pieces so that's what those blocks were for welded those on cleaned them up a little bit it was a little tricky because we had to keep everything cold um we didn't want to go ripping the entire scooter apart which would have been the right thing to do but again this was just a fun hobby project right because uh behind where we welded on those blocks is where the wiring goes on one side and the motor and the company important and the company used uh basically uh hot glue which melts uh so yeah we had to try and keep it cold that was one of the hardest parts of the whole thing was one of us was keeping something cold while while the other one's making it hot so the next thing we needed to do was find a belt that was going to work and one of the most difficult challenges with this is that the mercane wide wheel wasn't really designed to be to have a belt attached to it it's not any fault of the you know the but there's not a lot of room for a belt to fit and we were thinking you know oh we'll take some snowmobile thing and cut it and fit it but it wasn't going to fit because it'd be too thick right so we found a conveyor belt basically you can find this on amazon didn't know that four inch wide conveyor belt and then we had the problem where we're oh we found the conveyor belt how do you make it into a loop obviously you could you know drill some screws through it but those were going to break it's just a that's not a good solution yeah you got to keep it small come on clunk so if you go to your local grocery store and you put something on the checkout you'll notice that that is a loop and you'll notice that at some point when the two ends meet there's probably going to be a bunch of clips and we figured out we learned how to make those clips we're showing you here basically you buy a machine that kind of clamps the clips together splicer splicer you put those clips in there you attach it to one side of the belt then you touch the other side of the belt then you slide a rod through the middle and you've got yourself a belt now if you're a farmer watching the show right now you're probably duh we use this all the time we have to go out in the middle of the field fix our machines because there's lots of belts moving stuff around and so it's a very common practice in any farming community but for us knuckleheads we didn't know how to do it turned out to be actually one of the easiest parts of the project yeah i mean i was so worried about the belt i thought that we'd have to order a special belt and take the motor off and put it on and then get everything all set up um turns on you can just pull the pin out and now it's a flat belt but let's go back a step because we've kind of skipped a step we needed a frame that not only held the rear wheel of our new belt contraption but we also needed a way to tension that wheel right because if you throw a belt on something you need a way to make sure that it's under tension so we came up with what i think is a pretty darn neat solution all right this is the maiden test of the uh of the belt we're just gonna do really slow make sure you don't do the front wheel oh yeah oh yeah it's sliding that way okay so i'm assuming we can actually have some adjustability yeah put the tension here i agree so if i give it more tension there i'd expect it to come the other way sometimes it takes a revolution right it was working itself [music] so we knew that this was going to be in the snow and so we wanted a mechanism that was sort of protected um and that also looked kind of clean so yeah we went with this internal design where we take uh two different sizes of square tubing and we put one inside the other and then we cut a slot in the bigger one you put the axle through and then that is what is going to basically tension the belt is that you can pull that smaller piece back um so yeah that was a bit of fabrication a little bit of uh thinking problem solving was very fun to kind of conceptualize this idea and be oh if we do it wrong then the axle is gonna get hit by the threaded rod which is gonna be tensioning so yeah there's a bit of a learning curve there but um and we also had to make basically the um the frame at an angle yeah and that was kind of fun but now here we switch to steel tig welding and steel tig welding is so much easier than illuminating welding because we're doing this in dc i want to go back for a second and explain why aluminum welding didn't work on our mig welder it's a little bit of a tangent but follow me for a second when you're welding aluminum you have to use ac welding and on one cycle you are deoxidizing the metal on the other cycle you're putting energy into the metal to heat it up and so you're constantly doing deoxidizing heating deoxidizing heating and so you're making this arc all the time which sounds you're working in frank's science lab and and so it's kind of scary you're just when you go to dc tig welding for steel it's this nice just relaxed quiet experience just the whisper of the gas you don't even hear the electricity which is really cool i think that yeah tig welding is my favorite kind of welding yeah it's it's at whatever speed i decide i'm going at yes you should be going at a particular speed but if you make mistakes it's so much easier to go back and fix them as opposed to stick welding which is it seems neanderthal welding to me which is i understand the advantages of stick welding and in those cases i would probably bite the bullet and stick weld for mig welding i love that i don't have to feed any wire yep totally great you don't hardly have to do any thinking you're basically just kind of moving it along but tig welding i feel i'm in control of everything you have a foot pedal you can be varying the amperage you don't have to worry so much about settings if you're looking to get into welding right now is the best time i think to get into it um yeah if you take nothing else away from this it's a if you've ever kind of had an inkling to wanting to weld two pieces of metal together you can probably accomplish it and you can probably teach yourself just as easy as we did by first going to youtube and then picking up a piece of equipment our mig welder can do um you know gas mig we chose to do flux core which is if you're familiar with stick welding very similar to that in that you have flux which um creates the cover gas it's not being blown over it um it's a lot more messy but it is dirt cheap i think that the machine that we picked up was 150 bucks 150 bucks and it's actually a quality machine right now it doesn't have every setting under the sun but for putting two pieces of metal together two steel pieces of metal together uh it works a charm and it runs on 110 if you want it to so i mean you could literally run an extension cord and do this out where you need to it would have uh limitations in terms of amperage so you wouldn't be able to weld the biggest pieces of metal together but again for hobbyist welding for welding around the house where you're just oh it'd be so great if i could make i mean for instance we used it on our house we have this weird roof line that kind of comes and meets at a certain point it's completely unsupported and for the longest time we had a big ugly uh pole zach by the way built half the house um which is if you've seen the house that's why it's so big because he built it that way um for for cheap right for i remember you well i mean you get free labor right pulling stuff out of the trash son come up here on the roof look at these windows they're just throwing these away can you believe it yes uh they're surrounding us right now and half of them are fogged up but sure but anyway we had this roofline we wanted to add some really beefy metal support to it how are we gonna do we were gonna have to go call somebody they're gonna have to fabricate something for us we went down to home depot picked up i think was it uh four pieces of really beefy steel yep welded it together into the right angle that we needed bolted that to the front of the house i want a tree to come hit that because it's gonna snap in half yeah that's i'm just i feel so good that i have that skill to be able to weld so back to the sound so the snow scooter for goodness sake so we need some kind of wheels on the back to support our tread we got some wheels that i think were made for uh shopping carts uh put those on our grocery store stuff and uh after we weld it all together adjusted it i thought it wasn't gonna work it actually worked right out of the box maiden voyage baby [applause] snow snow snow snow [applause] [music] [applause] so we got that all tensioned ready to go except we needed one more thing we needed to put skis on the front so what do we do we bought a couple kid skis we just quickly we were in a rush we wanted to get out on the snow so bad so we just strapped them to the front wheel and well let's see what happens all right fire it up dude let's go [applause] ah oh it's so close so what you're seeing now is just a 500 watt scooter and as you're seeing it's having some difficulty right i mean um not only is it doing more than it ever had to do before it's going through this really uh drag coefficient slushy surface but also as the snow gets pushed up on the conveyor belt it's now kind of loading itself up with snow and so it's got a lot of inefficiencies in it and what we quickly realized was yes we technically did it but it's not really fun so we said to ourselves how do we get more power into this thing and we were looking at we were looking at we're going dang if only we had more power the front motor the front motor front motor was just sitting there on the front we had unplugged it it wasn't powering anything one of the things that we had noticed earlier uh before we put the skis on it was that when we had plugged it in it could kind of help pull through the snow but that would be too stupid to have a thing it needs a ski on the front so we thought make a couple changes and put this motor second motor on the rear i mean the two wheels are supposed to work together to push the scooter through anything so let's try it so the only problem that gave us was that now wiring wise we didn't have wire long enough to get us to the back it's a nine pin wire luckily go on amazon for 14 bucks we found the wire so that wasn't a problem magic uh then we removed the rear axle we replaced it with the motor now we had to do some changes to our setup we had to basically weld on some angle irons there make some notches so that we could put the motor into a bracket but basically it only took us a few hours to fix that and thank goodness we could weld yeah if we had to read because i don't even know how we would have made our first tensioning mechanism but if again i had an entire way of thinking which didn't ever use welding right right so i was always thinking oh we'll make something out of two by fours and plywood and some threaded rod and it's just welding is pretty good when it comes to this because you're if only these two things were connected you're done right so that's what we did you know before we go out on our first ride on this thing we should fix the front ski because now we have nothing to attach the front ski to so again we had to make a little something and again welding came in really handy we just drilled a hole through two pieces of tube steel which was more than we needed uh welded it to the plate that we had the skis attached to again completely over built but when you can weld why not over build it and just connected it up the same as it was with the wheel and it actually is able to go up and down yeah it's pretty fancy so now it's time for the maiden voyage of the thousand watt snow scooter how did it work [laughter] oh my god that's a thousand watts of power right there oh okay there we go [music] i just felt the skis are going to snap off if i turn too tight [applause] [laughter] not that it'll do anything [applause] [laughter] a freaking charm yeah i mean as you're seeing here uh i mean i yes i would love more power uh but a thousand watts was enough to get us going on even slushy snow everyone who wrote it was smiling ear to ear even though it's basically a conveyor belt to dump snow on your ankles again we can fix it we can fix that uh a little bit of welding a little bit of metal dude yeah um if and what's really cool is we could turn this back into a scooter with just taking off a few bolts exactly you take off the bolts you take off the motor put that back on you're back to scooting around back to scooting around the only indication that something has changed is those uh two aluminum things that we welded onto the sides yeah which i think look pretty good and you could even shape them to look right you know aerodynamic if you wanted to yeah so i mean yeah there's so many more improvements we could make obviously we could make it so that there would be something to brush the snow off the conveyor belt at the back that would save a lot of energy actually because then it wouldn't be fighting all that extra snow well i would say we did it yeah i mean that's a thousand watts of power and it worked just enough power uh we gotta do something about the snow buildup that's fine we'll make a little scraper a little snow scraper what do you think yeah but i mean look at that but basically we just first of all snow is disappearing up here can't believe it's february um we had to do this fast and we'd given ourselves a deadline of january 15th we actually got it done by february 15th a lot of that was because we're waiting for parts to arrive and stuff that i'm pretty proud of what we did and i think technically this was the first electric snow scooter in the world now i know there are snow bikes moon bike makes an electric snow bike but i don't think anyone was crazy enough to do what we just did and we did it and it worked i know this is a little off topic for this but it was something that we really felt we wanted to bring you it's it's electric mobility but it's also a very approachable project i don't think this is off topic at all actually i think the whole point of this is to talk about sustainability and many people around the world go and tinker in their garage with gas motors to make some kind of go-kart or gas-powered snow scooter we're showing you that you can now switch to electric to do these projects and it's cleaner it's quieter it's still safe it's still fun and i want to just point out the couple things that we didn't have to worry about we didn't have to worry about soldering we didn't have to worry about batteries we didn't have to worry about motor controllers or throttles or anything we just refused what was there we reused what was there and it's i mean most of these products are going to be made out of either aluminum or steel yeah there's going to be plastic on it but you can rip that stuff off and if you don't care what it looks and you can make it pretty afterwards i'm just saying this project to me opened my eyes to what is possible because yeah what other modifications can we make to uh e-bikes because yeah a bicycle in itself you don't want to be adding a ton of steel onto it but if it's got an electric motor that can already power itself pretty pretty well what's a what's a few more pounds what's uh i don't know i mean i already think of the next project i want to work on in terms of smaller electric uh mobility what's that it would be a uh a side car for an e-bike oh that sounds cool but not just any old side car yeah it's gonna hold a canoe what so you go you go out right yeah with a canoe on the side car you could have your friend in it you get to where you're going park the bike take the canoe out for a day oh you want a removable canoe that's also the side car put the canoe back in it drive home wow who lives next to a lake not everybody you know what's funny is before this project i would have said you're absolutely insane we can't pull that off but now that we've done this project i mean if you had said well we're gonna have to weld aluminum to aluminum i would have been we can't well now we can yeah and i don't know that we had to have made our frame on the snow scooter out of steel maybe we could have done it out of aluminum we certainly could have um it would have been lighter but it would have been more expensive a little bit harder and it wouldn't have been as easy to remove um we still could have kept the bolts in fact we could do that tomorrow if we wanted to we could weld up a frame made out of aluminum which would be lighter would you do that with your canoe sidecar would you make it out of aluminum or would you still do steel i really welding steel with tig very uh it's a very different experience again the noise is less steel has a higher surface tension which makes welding a little bit easier if anyone's getting into welding you'll this is the biggest thing that's stuck in my head i think that i would go with steel um but you we could do aluminum i don't know it depends on depends on what we decide well comment down below with your ideas i think this would be a good spring summer project i mean we got done in time to use our snow scooter in the snow now that the weather's getting better a canoe does make sense yeah and i just want to highly encourage if anyone wants to get into welding yeah it's a little bit scary yeah you're gonna need a bunch of different things um but if you're looking for a hobby and it would a hobby that could turn into a business as well oh yeah um this is definitely one of those things and it again the barrier to entry has never been so exactly humans are creative creatures we love to create and having more skills allows you to create more and i'm telling you mix welding with electric mobility and there's no limit to what you can do hey i want to thank you for watching and our patreons because without your support we couldn't have done this episode we couldn't have gotten the tools and the parts we needed to make it happen thank you so much for helping us make this happen we're going to see you next week now you know,0
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJl35aIy5pOVBHvoGgqavrdJ,E7hjUmiQQZ8,this year the average american driver is set to spend over three thousand dollars on fuel alone we're going to show you how you can spend about a hundred i'm zach and i'm jesse and you're watching in depth on now you know this episode is sponsored by our friends at henson shaving now one of the things that i almost never talk about the hudson shaper about and i feel so stupid after i talk about it is the design of the razor itself it has been uh designed from the ground up with shaving in mind not manufacturability not cheapness of how can we save a cent here in a penny there we're talking about how can we make the most amazing razor possible what first of all the thing is entirely aluminum i'm sorry there's a little bit of tungsten in it there's a thrust bearing that's actually made out of tungsten which is extraordinarily wear resistant which is why this razor is probably going to last you longer than you live and secondly the design is based all around trying to make this the best single bladed razor that you can possibly own i know but i don't know what you're talking about what makes it so great okay so you know when you're shaving with the regular old razor no i don't actually okay the gillette razors they have all the little blades really close to each other and it clogs up really quickly and then you i do remember the sink and you have to it was 30 years ago but i do remember you flip it over and it hasn't changed in 30 years has it they've maybe tacked on an extra blade here and there but nothing really has been changed the henson shaver is really nice because they've actually thought about after you've shaved the hair off of your face what happens to that hair and so they actually have evacuation shoots where you can when you rinse your blade under the razor comes right out so you're going to be shaving faster and then just also the way that it holds the blade in there unlike other single bladed razors where you have to really get a good feel for the angle and everything that you can pretty much we once you get the hang of it you just swipe across your face and you're shaving look i know what you're saying is true because over 2 000 now you know viewers have got the henson shaver and they're all happy with it yes you can join them and get get this huge deal 100 free razor blades yeah use our code now you know at hensonshaving.com when you check out with the new henson razor those hundred blades by the way double-sided that's 200 shaves with a fresh clean razor blade you do the math even if you shave only once per side that's going to get you well over a year of shaving so think about that and head over to hensonshaving.com the federal highway administration estimates that the average american driver travels 14 263 miles in their car each year with gas prices poking up into the six dollars a gallon level in some states the average american would be looking to shell out nearly 3 500 a year at the pump now this isn't also including the roughly 1200 spent on routine maintenance or the sometimes several thousands of dollars spent on major repairs tack onto that the taxes cost to register inspect and insure it and the amount of money you spend on your car can jump to over eight thousand dollars a year and that's not even taking into account what it costs to buy it and now is not the time to be spending this much at the pump the working definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth and guess what the last two quarters consisted of did you guess negative economic growth congratulations you're in a recession now i don't think i need to tell anyone this times are tough and getting tougher and reducing your spend is one way to ensure that you can get through the other side without too much financial hardship which brings us back to the automobile what was once a symbol of independence and prosperity is now a hefty economic burden weighed down by geopolitics and shortages of all kinds electric vehicles are far cheaper to fuel and maintain but if you're not on the list for a new one you could be waiting over a year for delivery now you could buy a used one tomorrow but the weird thing is with so much demand many used evs cost more than buying a new one we're going to share one of the cheapest forms of transportation but before we do you can help convince the algorithm to give us a break here if you'd hit the button thank you what if there were a vehicle that you didn't have to ensure cost less than one cent per mile to fuel tires cost 50 bucks you don't have to pay to park it and it costs less than what you'd spend to fuel your car this year [applause] [music] this is the new mqi plus sport it's a moped that can go 30 miles an hour why is everyone laughing i know i know i know it's not a car it doesn't have air conditioning or a heated massaging backrest you can't pack up everything you own in it and drive 5000 miles to your new life in alaska but it is a quiet clean and cheap means of transportation that could very well save you thousands of dollars a year to those of you already looking for a different to watch i understand consider an ev as your next vehicle but for those whose interests we've peaked let's get into the details we've picked the new mqi plus sport because it is in the middle of the pack in terms of price and capability now you can spend more and get more and you can save some money if you need less the mqi plus sport has a 40 mile range and can travel at 30 miles an hour it costs a little under 2 500 and can seat two people it has a removable battery and a charger that can fit in the seat this means that you can park and charge it at work just a laptop and that should enable the mqi to easily make the average americans 20.5 mile commute to work charge up and then scoot back the 20.5 miles home with plenty of range to stop off at the store or even pick up your friend now you might be asking if i'm willing to get a moped to save money why not just get a gas powered one they're cheaper to buy right well let's do some math a 50cc gas powered moped will get 100 miles per gallon on a good day nice if we consider the price of gas at five dollars a gallon it should cost you about five cents per mile compare that to the average car at 20 cents per mile so let's compare this to the new it has a range of 40 miles and a 2 kilowatt hour battery at the average american electricity rate of 16 cents per kilowatt hour that would mean that a full recharge of the mqi would cost 32 cents you said cents instead of dollars 32 cents three dimes two pennies so that means the cost per mile would be eight tenths of one cent yeah if you found a penny on the ground for every mile you rode you'd be cash positive so if you found a nickel you could travel for seven and a half miles yeah so extrapolating this out if you replaced all your driving miles with this scooter and again the average american drives 14 263 miles times eight tenths of a penny per mile you get 114 dollars and 10 cents per year wow wow that gas scooter would have cost over 700 to fuel and again the average gas car would cost over three thousand dollars a year wait so you're saving 2 900 a year on gas cost that's more than the cost of the scooter exactly exactly in less than a year you would have saved more money than you would have spent just on gas wow and then and you'd still have money left over you could go buy a ton of gummy bears okay so fuel price is one advantage that the new has over a gas powered moped but is there any other advantage yeah this is before we talk about maintenance obviously any moped is going to cost less than a car to maintain and repair but in a gas moped you do have to change the oil every thousand miles change the transmission oil adjust the valve clearances clean the air filter clean or replace spark plugs and check drive belts every two thousand miles you're right none of this is that expensive but it is time consuming to either perform or take to a place to have done and i guess another thing to consider though is noise yeah it's kind of the thing that mopeds are most well known for you know the ring [music] i think it's the single most unattractive thing about them it just conveys their lack of power and is annoying and grating to be anywhere near so you can imagine would to sit on them this neo and pretty much all emo peds are dead silent i mean it's quieter than most of the e-bikes i've tried the niu does come with a powerful horn and very bright lights um so i think it is good at making itself known without sounding a doorbell in a way in addition to noise i don't know if you know this but the gas engine of a gas moped has no emission controls yeah now interestingly a 100 mile per gallon 50cc two-stroke moped will put out about one-quarter of the carbon dioxide emissions of a typical car so it's good for the planet but it can put out far far more poisonous emissions carbon monoxide nitrous oxides and pm 2.5 this is because it burns the fuel less efficiently and has no catalytic converter or other methods of cleaning its exhaust now these are all things that you really don't want to be breathing in and again with the money you'd be saving on fuel in a year or two the neo would more than pay for itself over the gas moped look i get it maybe a moped is just not for you i mean you're willing to pay the on average 11 000 a year to own a car and you it that way yeah i mean there are plenty of reasons why this little electric moped might not work for you your commute is too long your climate is too icy or snowy you live in the outback and you're worried about kangaroos i've heard it all i know this isn't a viable option for everyone but even if you don't sell your car just having one moped to replace half of your trips could still save you thousands of dollars a year right even if you're only going to be riding it in the summer and it just replaces most of the trips that you take in your car over the summer not the long trip all the way up to the beach or to the hamptons or something that just the around town stuff you're going to save thousands of dollars and look i hear the other crowd too why spend all this money on an electric vote for cheaper or even a regular old-fashioned device for less and you're right for those of you who are fit enough to comfortably ride a bike everywhere it is even cheaper however the value of improvements that the mqi plus brings are significant firstly it's very comfortable the seat is soft and wide the seating position has your feet out in front of you the suspension is buttery smooth and you don't have to pedal the damn thing so there's no worries about sweating or chafing next it's faster than a lot of e-bikes out there clocking in at 30 miles an hour in some states you can even split lanes to skip traffic making it faster than driving a car and lastly it has great road presence road presence okay let's put it this okay when you're driving a car and you see a guy on a bike in the road what do you do um i pass them right and when you're driving in your car and you see a guy on a moped huh i guess i just follow along exactly it has been my experience that motorists are willing to put up with you on the road if you're on a moped since you belong there oh that's interesting very interesting yeah i don't really think of bikes as belonging on the road that's it's one center it's in a minor advantage over the moped i'll admit but it is a pretty big advantage on places where you might be driven off the road if you're riding a bicycle now i think the niu is a great compromise between comfort and cost for those with shorter commutes who want to take advantage of high used car prices you could sell your car buy this for way less save a ton of money which will then allow you to better save up for your next car or ev or a house or a trip to europe or anything and the even better part is that an electric moped works especially well for young people for students in high school or college this moped adds a ton of savings to a part of your life when you're not exactly rolling in money exactly trying to make money at a minimum wage job when gas prices parts and used cars are at an all-time high price just means more hours away from studying and enjoying what little time your childhood has left and on top of the gas and insurance savings the new will be far more reliable than a beater car ensuring that your aspiring student can show up to work or class every day this can prevent the death spiral that a faulty vehicle can cause where the car goes kaput you show up late to work or have to call out and lose your job you run out of money which you need to fix your car or buy a new one and pretty soon you're back in your parents basement so if you're interested in an electric moped check your local regulations most states don't require a motorcycle license or insurance for mopeds though some do many require the moped to be registered although some don't all of this will factor into the cost and hassle of switching but at the end of the day even if you have to register and insure it it will be less money than registering and insuring any car because i know that these gas prices aren't fun and i know that it's even less fun to be told go buy an ev when you can't buy one because everyone's trying to buy it i hope that letting you know about a different form of transportation was helpful if you did consider hitting the button and to now you know i'm so excited the technology this exists today that's right even a few years ago there weren't electric mopeds this yeah we picked ours up at a local scooter store called easy bikes and scooters up in exeter new hampshire the staff i gotta tell you the most friendly people you're ever going to meet super helpful and they had a huge selection of e-bikes and mopeds now we're not paid to say it we just had a great time up there and we really appreciate the work they're doing to get people on more efficient forms of transportation and again the new mqi plus sport isn't the only electric moped out there but i really love ours now you can check out our full review of it over on our now let's review thank you so much for watching now you know,0
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJl35aIy5pOVBHvoGgqavrdJ,PL_hBxK569E,hey everybody i'm zach and i'm jesse and you're watching in depth on now you know [music] so jesse we're about to talk to teague egan he's the founder and ceo of energy x and a disclaimer here we are early investors in this company take everything you see here with a little grain of salt or a little grain of lithium salt because we have invested early but i'm super excited about this interview and we wanted to bring it to you as soon as possible so check it out we want to thank birch living for sponsoring the show birch is a premium mattress in a box company that makes mattresses and sleep products that are stylish comfortable and environmentally conscious and it's that last part the environmentally conscious part that really first got my attention because birch makes organic non-toxic mattresses made right here in america with just four materials sourced straight from nature organic latex new zealand wool american steel springs and organic cotton yeah i've been sleeping on my birch mattress for about a year now and i love it for two big reasons all right what's the first reason first of all it's super comfortable my girlfriend and i used to toss and turn way more with my old mattress with my new birch mattress i find that we get much more restful sleep and we both feel more energy in the morning so what else what's the second reason look you're going to spend about a third of your life in your bed and for me i want a mattress that's going to be made out of organic and natural materials exactly birch is certified global organic textile standard green guard gold fair trade eco institute certified wool integrity new zealand and forest stewardship council it's made sustainably and that's important to us and birch living just introduced their newest mattress the birch luxe natural mattress deluxe takes the comfort and luxury of the original birch mattress to the next level and it's crafted with responsibly sourced and sustainably produced materials including organic cashmere deluxe is specifically created with breathability cooling and support in mind and offers increased airflow and targeted zoned lumbar support i actually think there's a third and a fourth reason you love your mattress that you may have forgotten about okay it's how you got your birch mattress and how you tested it oh right possibly the best part birch delivers your mattress right to your door for free within the us it comes rolled up in a box and it's super easy to set up for yourself and the hundred night sleep trial right not only is it way easier than going into a store and honestly at a mattress store you're really gonna be able to tell how a mattress is to sleep on yeah you have to sleep on it with birch you get more than three months to make sure that you love it if you don't they'll pick it up for you and i mean right out of your bedroom and you'll get a full refund and birch gives you peace of mind with a 25 year warranty look if you've been dreaming about a new mattress don't wait any longer use our link birchliving.com now you know and you'll get four hundred dollars off your birch mattress plus two free pillows those pillows by the way are made from recycled plastic bottles all right well we're so lucky today to have with us teague egan he's the founder and ceo of energy x and before we get started everybody jesse and i are early investors in this company so take everything you see with the grain of salt because we're super excited about this company and uh yeah we spoke to teague i think it was on your last uh the previous funding round right along with the rest of our investor club so it was uh good to speak to you then it's great to to see you today i think we should start off with this pretty recent quote by elon at his uh q2 earnings call yeah he said it's basically printing money right now there's software margins in lithium processing right now so i would really to encourage once again entrepreneurs to enter the lithium refining business you can't lose and uh t could you just remind us what business you're in the lithium refining business oh okay okay good so uh you've got the richest guy in the world who also makes who knows about lithium-ion batteries saying get in the lithium refining business you can't lose okay so i'm really glad to be speaking with you today he said he said that lithium refining is having a passport to print money i think that was yeah i think that uh especially everyone watching here knows a little bit about electric vehicles and knows that they have lithium ion batteries and so there's going to be lithium in those batteries i'm excited to see that you just i think deployed a direct lithium extraction pilot plant in bolivia can you tell us about that yeah so that was the beginning of the year we ran that pilot for five consecutive months it was it was awesome you know i think that we were the first company ever to deploy a real physical direct lithium extraction pilot plant to the field a lot of people are testing these technologies in in the lab setting and we went through the that phase and then we deployed to bolivia and bolivia is actually the world's largest lithium reserve so that was a pretty big milestone for the company and really the industry as a whole so i kind of want to go through a little bit of background on lithium and lithium extraction and refining because i think that a lot of people don't really understand there's always this meme on the internet and it's just you know people will say lithium is terrible and you the way that we refine lithium is is horrible i want to talk about how it's done and how you do it and how that's going to lead to changes in the future so i think that when you talk about environmental ability and sustainability you need to baseline it against something anybody can say that anything is terrible right but if you're talking about the carbon emissions or carbon footprint of lithium versus fossil fuels there's no comparison right and you really need to measure this on in two different areas one is the carbon emissions that it takes to extract something from the ground and then the second is the carbon emissions that are emitted when you utilize it in an application right so when you are extracting lithium from the ground or pumping up fossil fuels there is a carbon footprint right the difference is when you utilize fossil fuels you burn them once and then it's done and then you need to do it over again right with lithium you're using it in batteries that last for 10 or 20 years so if you are baselining lithium versus fossil fuels there's no comparison no comparison at all now if you go inside lithium there's two different types of lithium resources that you can extract or produce lithium from one is hard rock resources which you're extracting it from an ore called spodamine and you can think of this as the same as a big open pit mining operation with you know big tractors and and dump trucks and uh that's pretty carbon intensive you're just digging up the earth and going through a refining process uh with the ore then there is brine extraction which is where lithium is uh found as a salt that is dissolved in this water and lithium is alongside other salts magnesium and sodium and these are really really salty waters and lithium is but a fraction amongst a sea of other salts you need to pump that water up from below the surface it's actually pretty shallow around you know some some cases 200-ish meters and then once it's on the surface you need to extract the lithium out of the brine away from the other impurities and the way they do that today is these massive evaporation ponds they're literally the size of new york city 15 square mile pond systems the lithium goes through this sequence of ponds which is using natural sunlight so that's not very carbon intensive and then it goes through a final processing facility how long does that take by the way it takes about 18 months on average in the comparison again when you're talking about uh environment hard rock versus brine again there's no comparison brine will always be less carbon intensive in terms of its emissions than hard rock right so now you've narrowed it down again right so now we're focusing in brine right and i just explained the conventional way that lithium is produced from brine now when you look at the the conventional evaporation ponds versus direct lithium extraction there are pros and cons right using the the conventional pawns there's very very limited power because you're you're using the sun right it doesn't get less carbon intensive than that however there are other environmental factors that that come into play here one is water when you're just evaporating the water you're losing a lot of this water from the surrounding water table that can be used for agricultural purposes and that's something that the surrounding indigenous communities has a big problem with uh the amount of water that it takes using the conventional methods with direct lithium extraction we use very very little water so so that's a plus right we do use a little bit more power or energy than say natural evaporation but you can source that energy using renewable methods either have close proximity to a wind farm or solar and then the third is the geographical footprint so as i mentioned these ponds are 15 square miles a facility that does direct lithium extraction may be 10 acres or you know relatively small compared to 15 square miles so there's pros and cons but within brine overall direct lithium extraction is less carbon intensive and has a better impact on the environment than the conventional methods and let's just talk about time for a second so you said about 18 months to do the conventional method how long does your method take yeah so it takes 18 months of residency time right to go through the ponds which is bad when a customer comes to you and says hey i need lithium next week they're you have to say oh well you know see in two years direct lithium extraction is a lot quicker you can process in a matter of days and then have lithium ready in a matter of you know a few weeks after final processing so there's a huge huge time advantage there now you build these plants to have a certain annual capacity right so these pawn systems could be putting out 30 000 tons per year you would build a dle facility to put out 30 000 tons a year so the output on an annual basis may be similar but the lead times in terms of getting there uh is the big big difference well thanks for giving us that secret jessie and i are going to go start a lithium extraction company so see ya yeah uh before we do that teak how do you do the how do you do that oh yeah how do you use the secret how did you directly extract the lithium we uh had developed a portfolio of technologies uh that do this and and the way that somebody can think about this on a semi-scientific level is that using the conventional methods which are these big evaporation ponds you're just letting the sun evaporate the water the h2o and all these dissolved salts are crashing out the bottom precipitating and then you move the brine to the next pond and more water evaporates and more salts precipitate and finally at the end lithium is one of the last salts that's left over that hasn't precipitated then you final process it out it's this natural evaporative system and the whole idea is a step change in technology to a mechanical controlled separation system and there's a lot of other variables that come into effect if it rains say a few inches on the ponds when you're trying to evaporate the water that could delay that 18 months to 24 months right you and you need a huge salt flat that's no elevation changes to build these pawn systems that are the size of manhattan so you need the perfect place with no rain with incredibly high uv rays to be able to do this natural evaporation whereas direct lithium extraction you just pump up the the water the brine and you process it through a controlled facility right now in that controlled facility is where the technology is and we are utilizing three different types of technology that are all prevalent in other industries but have never been adapted for lithium and the reason is because we've never needed lithium before until 2012 to 2015 you know tesla was making a few thousand cars a year but there was never this huge demand for lithium and because of that no smart people focused on well how do we improve from this conventional evaporation pond to a direct lithium extraction in a mechanical manner right so we've taken um technologies from other industries for instance selective membranes right selective membranes are used in a variety of industries for separations in many different things they're using oil and gas to do separations it's used in agriculture it's used in food and beverage to you know refine milk and soda all these different things use membranes it's used in desalination where we can take salty ocean water run it through a membrane and have fresh drinking water on the other side separating all the salts so we took these learnings and this knowledge and said we're going to make membranes that are selective to just lithium so that's one of the technologies we use however there is not a one-size-fits-all direct lithium extraction technology so the brines in bolivia are very different than the brines in california right so solvent extraction is the second uh technology that we use where you can have you can design a molecule that you mix into the brine and it it extracts just the lithium it's a liquid liquid separation and then it pours over into another holding tank and you know how water and oil will separate there's phase separation i'm sure you've seen that in you know your 11th grade chemistry class or something that right now the extractant has the lithium and when it separates the brine doesn't have lithium the extractant has the lithium and then you extract the lithium from that extraction and it runs in a continuous cycle right so this is something solvent extraction that's used for 25 of the entire world's copper production and copper we're making tens of millions of tons on an annual basis maybe more it has a variety of applications so we just took that knowledge of solvent extraction and applied it to lithium right the third is called ion exchange and that's a resin or a bead a sponge that will attract the lithium and then similar to solvent extraction you need to extract it again from from the bead so we use all three of those technologies uh depending on what brine uh and what customer we're working with but that's what that's that's the kind of you know so to say secret sauce inside the plant great i guess we're not gonna well no that's perfect so it's three uh pre-existing technologies so let's go start our lithium company what's to stop us right yeah exactly there you go well i mean i mean is there anything that can stop us i think he patented them did you did you yeah well we have we have 50 patents right now okay yeah yeah so yeah harder than we thought all right but i think i got him the pawns sound really cheap and his thing sounds really expensive right we just need a guy with a bulldozer we know a guy with a bulldozer and a desert and a big salt flat and hope it doesn't rain right we'll get a big tarp it and so i mean this is uh what a difference in extraction that you're you're going from a highly labor intensive solution but wait does but does your uh system save money yeah it saves a lot of money the way we think about unit economics in lithium is on a cost per tonne basis so how much does it cost you to produce one ton of lithium and then for us how much does it cost to produce a ton and conventional methods across different brine operations and different hard rock is even higher costs brine operations you can roughly say cost four thousand to five thousand dollars per ton for us we're looking at around twenty five hundred dollars per ton oh so it's cheaper and you can sell that exact same stuff because it is the exact same stuff for the same price that they would have to be spending more to process but is it the exact same stuff because i thought your stuff was even better i mean there's different grades of lithium that producers sell into the market how refined you can get it and what that means is what percentage of lithium is in the salt right lithium is sold as it looks just table salt right it's just the the chemical composition of it battery grade is considered at 99.5 percent pure lithium but there is that 0.5 of other stuff that made it all the way through the magnesium sodium etc in our processes we purified up to that battery grade there's also different types of lithium that different batteries use other than just the grade but we we can make all of those different things so to answer your question it's essentially the same purity and grade of lithium and so if you're able to basically create exactly the same as what other producers of lithium who are using evaporation ponds can do and then sell it at the same price but you spent less to process it then you're getting a higher margin for your lithium yeah it's that and the demand of lithium is there people are buying lithium 10 years into the future right now trying to secure their supply all these big auto manufacturers the reason that elon said what he said is because lithium is the biggest bottleneck to producing electric vehicles why do you think the cyber truck hasn't come out why do you think all these other car companies haven't already transitioned their entire fleets to electric when tesla is worth more than all the other car companies combined it's because the supply chain to make the batteries but more importantly to get the materials that go into the batteries is limited and the producers are producing as much as they can and they're producing today 500 000 tons a year by 2030 we're looking at three to three and a half million tons a year what direct lithium extraction does in in addition to a lower price is it unlocks otherwise unviable resources in terms of their geography i explained you need the perfect place to build the ponds right if we found lithium underneath new york city and we wanted to extract it using conventional brine techniques we'd have to just knock down all of uh new york city and just you know build those ponds and then hope it doesn't rain it rains in new york city more frequently than it does in oblivion deserts you said that basically bolivia and and kind of uh those those spots in south america are some of the largest reserves of of lithium but are there other reserves that are maybe a little bit closer to home bolivia is part of an area known as the lithium triangle it's made up of southern bolivia northern argentina northern chile and the reason the lithium triangle has so much lithium is because the andes mountain range which is the second biggest mountain range in the world behind the himalayas the rain would fall and then the minerals would flow with it down into the chilean coast into the pacific right and these huge salt flats formed and they were rich in lithium right so that has 60-ish percent of the world's known lithium reserves however there are other volcanic formations uh several in the u.s the great salt lake in utah right that's in another mountain range it's not quite as high as the andes the andes is about fifteen thousand feet the rockies are seven to nine thousand ish you know some areas get a little bit higher but there are good concentrations of lithium in the great salt lake uh there are good concentrations of lithium in the smack over region which is texas and arkansas there's good concentrations of lithium in the salton sea in california which is in the imperial valley area so so the us has a lot of good lithium reserves it's probably third behind the lithium triangle being the first australia has great hard rock reserves and then the us has uh the third best reserves in the world from a uh geopolitical standpoint this sounds pretty good i mean if if biden tomorrow said hey we should get on this this lithium-ion business we need to turn on all the reserves that the united states has because if we can produce more batteries than say i don't know some other countries we're going to have a huge geopolitical advantage do you think that that's something that uh energy x could take advantage of if that were to happen tomorrow what happened yesterday yeah right i mean that sounds pretty good right so so basically you'd just be scaling up your production wherever there is briny uh stuff that you can get out of the ground right yeah exactly i mean look there's three variables that come into play when you're thinking about lithium extraction in terms of the brine itself how good is this brine right we all know the middle east is the best for oil you know you stick a straw on the ground oil comes up for brine there's three variables one is what is the starting concentration of lithium in in the brine uh and that's judged on a parts per million basis south america has the best it's it's better than the us but the us has pretty good the second is the impurity profile so what is the percentage of lithium compared to all the other salts and what are all those other salts that you need to separate the lithium away from and the third is temperature what temperature is this brine coming out of the ground at is it ambient temperature room temperature or in the case of most u.s brines is it hot geothermal they're drilling down thousands of feet to bring it up right so those are the three different things now that the biden administration has provided subsidies or incentives and grant programs around u.s production it makes it a lot more attractive for a company me to focus our time and effort in the us versus south america there's a lot of different grant programs uh the doe has programs they're doing big loan programs for advanced vehicle manufacturing and the supply chain and then this infrastructure bill that just got passed earlier this week is another 400 billion dollars and it's giving huge subsidies for electric vehicles if their supply chains are from the us so there's huge incentive now for u.s based companies to localize or or domesticate their supply chains and as we've been discussing lithium is the biggest bottleneck to the electric vehicle transition so there's a lot of incentive for these vehicle companies and battery companies to invest into the us to make these lithium resources come into production this must be an exciting time for you because when we talked to you last um this was kind of lab based and now you've had a chance to actually test it out in the field in real world conditions and it's worked right yup yup yeah this is the first time i think the doe is even focused on things mining because this is the first time that to make vehicles involved mining and yeah and said basically if you want to get this tax credit most of the mining has to take place here in the us so you must be talking to a lot of people now who are really focused on that and you have a technology that allows them to do it here yeah i mean we're we're in an incredible position right now and it's a lot of people don't really focus this it just seems such an obscure thing right it's so far upstream from somebody buying an electric vehicle okay an electric vehicle needs a battery so people are familiar with batteries right batteries power consumer electronics phones computers okay batteries are important but then what goes into the battery not a lot of people think about that and then how we get the material that goes into the battery is just in the different universe right right and even even big organizations the doe didn't really focus on this type of thing until it became apparent that one we need to decarbonize and two the supply chain to decarbonize is in controlled by china today 80 percent of the processing and and i i know we don't want to be dependent on china so it's something that's come to the forefront and come to the forefront extremely fast and you know quotes the one elon made help infrastructure bills and regulation uh from from government's help i couldn't be more grateful that that we're in the position that we are today and you know you're we're having we're having tremendous conversations with big players that are really recognizing the need uh for direct lithium extraction and refinery so um i see in your deck that you have a phased approach to this so you're i think working on generation one can you explain to our viewers the difference between the different generations of tech that you're gonna be working on a reason a big reason that a lot of tech companies die it can be it can be the most brilliant technology in the world is the go-to-market strategy there are of course rare cases where a technology is so disruptive and so uh needed by a large it's mostly large consumer bases that it breaks this mold um but it's not uh you know the the average joe is going to buy direct lithium extraction right uh in terms of an uber yeah you can have something disruptive that and it's a consumer-facing product right and that forces change but direct lithium extraction it's a it's mainly a b2b thing and when we were looking to sell into the existing producers and say hey we actually have a better way to do this than uh the pawns there was there was pushback because a few reasons one mining is a very capital intensive thing uh and they've already invested billions of dollars into these ponds and existing uh plants and infrastructure and to just even have that thought where something could replace you they're not gonna help foster that type of disruption two it's it's kind of an oligopoly right now there's five lithium producers and to let a new guy in that could totally shake things up is a scary thought process right so what we decided is we need to make our technology complementary to what they're doing right similar to the way that uh you can have an existing oil well and uh you could just implement fracking into that and and produce five times more oil with the same existing infrastructure so our phase one our generation one is complement the existing pawns right and that will prove out the technology on a commercial basis uh it'll greatly increase the revenues of these companies because they're they have two to three x higher yields of lithium and then when the ponds are completely maximized that still won't be enough lithium to supply the market demand so then we can go to generation 2 which is directly from the well no ponds necessary but we do have this solution that complements because the ponds right now operate on about 30 to 40 percent recovery rate so for every 100 tons of lithium that you're pumping out of the ground that's dissolved in the brine you only get 30 tons they're leaving 70 tons on the table so we figured out a way to to get up to 90 or 94 was our you know mark in bolivia and figure out a way how to maximize all the sunk capex that the big producers have already spent right so that's generation one generation two uh we're already working on which is direct from the wellhead but it's kind of this phased approach right because doing generation two again very capital intensive we're just taking advantage in generation one of all the money that's already been spent generation two you know you gotta build a bigger plant because you're processing more brine too so i think we have a pretty smart go to market approach uh that is now being accepted by the existing producers i mean they recognize that direct lithium extraction is happening there's a lot of smart people working on it now a lot of big companies in addition to us and it is necessary to fulfill the exponential demand uh that that we're seeing now and into the future so that's kind of our phase go to market approach what was your partner's reaction to the pilot program and the numbers you were seeing we ran that pilot in bolivia and the numbers speak for themselves the the data set that we got which was also validated by the customer uh the country of bolivia we we were superior to all the other uh companies that were also trying to test now so bolivia ran this international tender for direct lithium extraction companies to apply and then do a pilot and they had dozens of applications from all over the world and they chose eight companies uh to participate in the pilot program and of those eight companies energy x was the only company that actually put a physical pilot plant down in the solar and operated it continuously for a five-month span all the other companies had shipped back to their laboratories and did testing there it's a totally different ball game to be testing in the field continuously 24 7 for five months straight so that really proved to us that we are one of if not the leader in in the lithium refinery and extraction space in terms of what the customer thought bolivia is a political place and i thought that you know i could uh overcome those challenges the other competitors in this race were from russia and china and bolivia has still not yet determined how they want to move forward but we got tremendous results and now we are working on five more pilots for other customers because they've seen that we're capable of operating and deploying these plants and they want to see how it works on their resources so overall it was a great experience and a great result i think now as jesse mentioned last year we were part of your one of your first rounds uh we were early investors but now we just heard some big news that you guys just i think closed another big round we did a deal with a private equity firm that committed 450 million dollars uh to our business upon a go public listing so once we take the company public we have access to those funds in in the midterm we are in the in the process of bringing on some strategic partners which hopefully will be announced very soon and we're doing another uh crowdfunding offering it's it's kind of in a wait list right now and we have a lot of interest but anybody can go to energyx and sign up for the wait list and we're going to open up another round of funding for retail investors and beginning investors really shortly here so talk to me about the project roadmap that you have here going forward so what does it look over the next few years i to think of project road maps um in segments so i think about you know i have my schedule today right and then i have okay what do i need to schedule for the for the week what are my goals for the month the year five years and then we have a 10-year master plan on our website so i think about scheduling kind of in in those different tranches and in terms of the next six six or so months we are building these five additional pilot plants for customers that are that are unannounced you know those those will be big announcements when we make them but getting our technology to different lithium sites uh and bringing in that those lines of business is going to be a fundamental game changer for our company after that we are the next six months so in one year we're thinking about how do we scale these pilots to larger demonstration facilities so our pilots show on a relatively small scale you can think about how if you're thinking about how much it produces per year you could say 10 tons of lithium which is not very much but we're proving the process in the field over a six month consecutive run from there we want to scale up to a demonstration uh size that's maybe 200 tons and and these are full commercial modules but we're not but we're not building a full commercial plant yet we're doing commercial modules so the way that we've designed and thought through our commercialization process is to do it in a modular fashion or an equilibrium fashion so modular it's legos right legos are all the same size and you can you can have 10 of them or you can have 10 000 of them so once we prove the full commercial size in the field it's extremely easy to go from a hundred tons to a hundred thousand tons per year right so that's two or three years right so next six months put put additional pilots with some of the biggest customers and some greenfield sites next 12 months get one or two commercial uh modules which is dubbed our demonstration scale if you produce 100 or 200 tons and then two to three years we will re then just as fast as we can build them or build the bigger units and and then in three years we're thinking full commercialization producing you know hundreds of thousands of tons of lithium now you were saying earlier you um that you felt so fortunate that all of this uh stuff in terms of you know money and business is probably going to be coming your way uh is are you really fortunate or does the early bird just get the worm i mean i i want to kind of go back and figure out how you figured all of this out how you saw this coming before everybody else decided uh that it would be a good idea to kind of glom onto this or before everyone else went oh crap we need a lot of lithium who knows how to make lithium and you're yeah i already figured it out hi it's me um how did you know nobody starts a company if they think it's nobody's oh that's a terrible idea i'm gonna go through that idea right i obviously thought this was a good idea in 2018 when i started the company did i ever think that the richest man in the world would be saying lithium refinery is a passport to print money i thought it was a good idea but i i'm grateful because the exponential curve and the demand for lithium and all the big auto oems committing tens of billions of dollars to transitioning their fleet has all greatly affected my business not in my wildest dreams that i think that it would happen this quickly and become this big of an issue um and really become the main bottleneck so for that reason i'm grateful how i thought about the idea i've owned a tesla since 2013. so shout out shouts to elon again it's just the the most amazing car i've ever driven um it's just not only the fact that it's uh a battery-powered car other other car companies that made battery-powered cars right but he made it cool it's the fastest car right it goes to 60 and whatever it is mine's four seconds but now he's making them in under two seconds he changed the screen nobody's ever seen a screen that in a car uh the handles are automatic you run your car with a basically a hotel room key card everything about it is just incredible and i knew that the the demand for this car was going to skyrocket especially if you could make a cheaper one i have the model s and then he went out and made the the model three so he made electric cars cool and that is what caused all the other car companies to say we need to do this and then he became you know the most valuable car company in the world and then tesla became more valuable than all the car companies together and then he became the richest man in the world and it's been this snowballing effect but in 2018 i took a trip down to south america you know i love to travel and i love to travel on the unbeaten path you know there's people that to go to the beach i to go to the mountains of bolivia and see the the largest salt flat in the world because it's a extremely unique and beautiful place and uh i'm on this trip to solar de uyuni and my my tour guide starts telling me how this is the world's largest lithium reserve and i said we're going to need a whole lot of lithium if my thesis of the energy transition is accurate and that was largely based on my experience driving a tesla but never did i think that it would be this big right this fast so that was when i had the idea based on this trip then i came to find that bolivia as a country wasn't yet producing out of the world's largest resource and i said that's a problem that i you know is is worth me dedicating my time to and if if i'm anything it's a problem solver you know i i don't have a scientific or technical background i studied economics in school but i can solve problems from from a first principles point of view and i can build great teams and i know that i can go attract people that are a lot smarter than me and that's that's what we've done in energy x and we have a team of 50 brilliant scientists and engineers uh that are that are working around the clock to build direct lithium extraction technologies and i'm grateful for that as well so but why didn't you just buy a bulldozer down in bolivia and start carving out ponds why weren't you well okay i'll do that how did you come up with the idea of of direct lithium extraction as opposed to just oh well if this is i'll just be rising with the tide of everybody else i'll just i'll buy up some tracks of land in bolivia and start producing yeah you know i certainly could have done that there are a lot of people out there that they see the the rise in lithium and they're going about it the conventional way and i could have started a lithium company and bought uh a track of land and and started to build my you know rented a bulldozer right so i went first went to bolivia in 2018 as a tourist i had the idea i came back to the united states i uh started researching everything i could um i found this guy who was in water desalination and i brought him back down to bolivia and we this was the first time that i got to see the palms and i'm asking all these questions about the ponds and i understand that it takes a really long time that they have extremely low recovery rates you know 30 or 40 percent bolivia it's in single digits because they have some chemistry problems and and i'm asking all these questions and and pretty much the answer i got was well this is just the way it's always been done and that's my least favorite answer this is the way it's always been done my least favorite question is why hasn't somebody already done why hasn't somebody else already done that that's my least favorite question but that that answer to me was just insufficient and i saw the pawns and anybody with two eyes can look at these pawns and say this is thousand-year-old technology and there has to be a better way to to do this than relying on building these huge ponds relying on natural evaporation we're living in 2022 here it does seem ancient andes civilizations could have been extracting lithium in the exact same way right it did i mean aside from maybe drilling the wells but i feel they could have figured that out if they needed lithium which they didn't but i mean the technology they would have just used shovels and and rakes and stuff instead of the bulldozers yeah you're absolutely right when you're saying thousand-year-old technology you're not far off right so i mean wow so you just you were there has to be a better way to solve it but you know what he didn't stop there i was just looking that you have another product in your portfolio you have lithium metal batteries so can you tell us about solus which is your lithium metal batteries why are you guys getting into that aren't there other companies doing this quantum scape and stuff yeah there are um but but then again you know there were uh other you know to some extent there were other companies trying to do evs before tesla came there were other battery companies before quantum escape came there were other direct lithium extraction companies before energy x came and you know i am looking at lithium and batteries as the biggest industry of the next 50 years batteries are going nowhere batteries will power our future uh especially for mobility even if even if we make nuclear fusion happen and have unlimited uh renewable energy generation you can't put a nuclear fusion reactor in every single car right so for any type of mobility you need batteries um so batteries are coming right not they're not already here but better batteries the way that i thought about lithium metal batteries we licensed our first four patents from the university of texas uh you know when i when i got the idea down in bolivia i the first thing i did was start researching who else was who are smart people that are working on this right i know nothing about this who's the smartest person that i can go talk to and it led me to a gentleman at the university of texas named dr benny freeman and he's one of the most renowned membrane experts in the world and just we used membranes for desalination turning ocean water into fresh drinking water he was working on lithium selective membranes so i meet up with him i licensed this technology but it so turns out that the inventor of the lithium ion battery sits in the in the office right next to him dr john good enough i'm talking to my dad and my dad is a serial entrepreneur i i aspire to become as successful as as he has been and he said you have to go meet this guy i'm oh i have nothing to work on with him so one day i walk over to his office and i tell him i'm working on these lithium selective membranes he says you should take a look at some of the battery technologies that use lithium that we're working on they say that's not a bad idea so uh i ended up meeting um his last phd student so dr good enough just turned 100 years old wow up until two right before covet he was coming into work every day as a hundred year old man wow trying to invent the next battery and he has some incredible patents and ideas for the batteries that his group his phd group is trying to build so i made a great relationship with him made a great relationship with his last phd this gentleman dr nick grundish and nick has become our vp of battery technology and we have i think four of dr goodenough's former students that are part of our battery team and there's a lot of synergies between the extraction and the battery the logical one being the lithium that's produced from the extraction can be used in the battery the unlogical one is that the membranes that are used for lithium extraction are very similar to the membranes that are using the solid state separator that goes in between the anode and the cathode and the lithium travels back and forth from it's it's certainly uh an exciting kind of initiative that we're working on we have a phenomenal team that's uh building these lithium metal batteries uh we also have a novel proprietary technology that produces the lithium metal that goes into our lithium metal battery so brine lithium resource owners can ship us liquid salty brine we can turn that directly into lithium metal and the lithium the other types of lithium that go into the battery and build our own lithium metal batteries all in-house we essentially are a lithium refiner that is going from brine all the way to battery and that's that's where i see um our company going but an integrated ecosystem going as well i feel really smart right now not because i understand any of this but because i invested in it last year wow this was really fun to learn about i'm also super inspired by your story the fact that you didn't let the fact that you know i'm a philosophy major right i'm not a science major but you didn't let that stop you from trying to solve the problem you you said something really inspiring here you tried to find really smart people and work with them i think a lot of people out there think well if i'm not smart enough i can't do it and that you didn't let that stop you you knew what your skills were and they're really important skills and you saw a problem that was worth solving and you went and solved it also can i just point out in a very short amount of time you only discovered this problem in 2018 and and now 2022 we're here talking about actually having a pilot plan having stuff up and running um yeah because i mean when i was investing i thought well this is probably 10 or 20 years off right yeah i mean the speed at which you're moving is is exciting that's that's a good way to invest long-term investing a lot i mean there are people that are asking me why we're not already producing lithium and it's if only you knew the complexity to the problem another thing that i took from elon i try to build he's just been so successful and so innovative and game changing not only the way that he builds technology and bit but also the way that he's structured his business so when you say oh i i didn't expect a pilot for for years our thought process is that the way that you can think about progress is the equivalent of number of iterations times the progress between iterations right so if i was thinking about a pilot plant and i was trying to make the perfect pilot plant that that would i could put in bolivia and the next step was commercialization and it was a hundred ton pilot plant and i had five years to build this pilot plant i might build a pilot plant that i put down there and it doesn't work right instead i'm trying to do something where i have a small pilot plan six months and then a slightly larger pilot and then i take everything i learned from that and iterate and iterate and iterate and build the next slightly bigger pilot plant in 12 months and then i take everything i learned from that and and do a slightly bigger one in two years and then by the time it's five years i might have a full commercial plant because i've deployed and learned and iterated deployed and learned and iterated and that's the way that we're approaching the development of these technologies across the board that's awesome thank you so much for sharing this with us today i'm really excited i'm also really excited that it seems it's still possible for people out there who are also as excited as we are to to get involved so they should go where to find out more uh energex.com all right well cool thank you so much i can't wait to check back in with you in i don't know a year or so and see what's going on zach jesse thanks for having me guys i am so excited that uh well you didn't see this because we just stopped the recording but i was uh basically online putting my name on that investor list on energy x's website um i'm interested in investing more so disclaimer again we're we're very interested in investing in this company um i think you should might want to consider becoming a patreon at the investor club level because i mean we actually got to meet teague about a year ago and got in early even before all this because we met him and brought him to our investor club privately so that we could all meet him and ask him questions that's what we do here on the investor club so we have a disruptive investing for just this reason an investing club just for this reason we kind of understand disruption and when we heard about energy x we're this is disruptive and we should share this and uh we talk a whole lot more about our thoughts on energy x over as uh one of our investor club patreon bonus stories so if you want to check that one out you can join us over on patreon sign up for the 10 level and you can check out uh that little there and also join our investor club yeah so let us know what you think in the comments below thank you so much for watching we'll see you next week now you know,0

us today the co-ceo chris anthony and the head of solar energy car from aptara thank you so much guys for being with us looks you guys have your shades on awesome to be with you the future is so bright at epterra some exciting news i guess going on up tara we just heard about a few days ago that you have a new partnership you want to tell us about that yeah we have an amazing new partnership with cpc in italy they build some structures for amazing supercars uh that you've seen throughout the years and now we've partnered with them to make our beautiful body and carbon monocoque structure for production really a way that we can scale production you know we never thought possible with our old composite technologies and now moving into production with them we just see a bright future and really being able to uh to crank these up tears out so sandy monroe was on the talking about how he really was impressed with that technology can you tell us more about so why go with carbon fiber it sounds super expensive carbon fiber is a bit more expensive than other materials you could use obviously but you get the great benefits of light weight and strength and from sandy's point of view it's also a coefficient of thermal expansion problem that when you use materials with large coefficients of thermal expansion it makes it really hard when you get to the production floor and aligning things and tolerancing things together notoriously in steel vehicles you know once you weld them they start to bend and twist and you know that's why you see videos of vehicles made in the 70s and they're putting two by fours in the doors and you know pressing the hinges back so they can get the doors to align with a body in carbon that just doesn't exist you're basically taking a rock out of a mold and putting it you know on a pedestal to bond the other pieces to it and it's just dimensionally accurate to the nth degree you see some of the supercars that cpc builds and the quality is just immaculate and you know that's what we hope for uh for our app terra builds in the future is there anything to be worried about i remember back in the day people loved their bmw wi threes but then they would get into the slightest little fender bender and they'd have to throw away the whole car because it was totaled basically a five mile an hour collision is this something we're gonna have to worry about with aptara we have taken into account you know those kind of fender bender type accidents uh you know we have a separate kind of rear uh piece we have a nose cone piece and obviously our wheels are outboard so you know you would change the wheel cover um you know if you got into a fender bender or something that but the structure being so strong has huge benefits you know and and low speed accidents and kind of you know the dings and scratches you get in parking lots and you know grocery carts rolling into your ftera you know they just aren't a thing think of the saturn of years ago you know they had um smc door panels uh they were class smc not not carbon smc but you know the black them with a sledgehammer um and nothing would happen to the door panel we're taking that to kind of the next level uh in terms of strength so you know really it's about you know lightweightness and having our large organic that can be super aerodynamic but you know on the other side of that we think is a very very durable product that you know will hopefully stand the test of time and be a vehicle that will last for generations uh not years now i gotta be honest one of the things that really first attracted me to the upterra was the solar right having this vehicle that is so efficient and that can run off the sun i was yes but then i started getting a little skeptical that's probably just me but i was are they gonna actually be able to pull off solar all over this weirdly shaped body so anuj tell me what has it been trying to get solar on there where do you guys where are you guys today with that technology uh you're absolutely right one of the greatest challenges with getting solar on this vehicle is trying to build solar panels that will uh both match the complex geometry of the vehicle but will also last 10 15 years as our target so a number of folks will say oh it's been done before you know you see these solar race cars that college students build but what a lot of folks don't realize first of all is the curvature on those vehicles is very slight in many cases but they're also definitely not built for long-term reliability so a number of these folks will you know they'll run their race and pull it back in and just protect it you know wiping it with a nice microfiber cloth or something of that nature to to protect it and any kind of small impact you talk you tap on it you break it but we've actually been able to do a couple of things in order to achieve uh two axis curved solar that lasts that 10 to 15 year range so first we actually announced a partnership with maxion recently maxion is an industry leader in in solar so they produce a a cell type that's called an interdigitated back contact which essentially means the contacts are on the back of the cell and you're able to get an incredibly a significant amount of flexibility from the cell with a very thin footprint while still using a silicon based cell type so a number of folks will ask well hey when you start to go to the semi-flexible cell type don't you sacrifice efficiency and typically that's actually the case you start to look at thin film cell types or other cell technologies and you almost always have a trade but we're actually able to leverage this technology that uses a monocrystalline or silicon cell type and matches this two axis curvature in our lamination process to get very high efficiency cells in the panel so that's one thing that's definitely added a lot of value to our technology the second is actually developing what we call a lamination stack so our solar panel actually consists of nine different layers you may look at it and say that doesn't look there are nine different layers in a stack but solar cells are actually incredibly susceptible to environmental conditions as i mentioned earlier so for example you want to protect against water vapor transmission you don't want the cells to to corrode due to what's in the air really intruding on that solar cell so we have to use laminate materials that will block the environment from the cell while also including layers that have very high light transmission and a very low coefficient of thermal expansion what that's actually led us to do is create a nine layer stack up that together offers all of the benefits that you might need for protecting the solar cells with actually about 50 percent of the weight of what might be commonly used in in the industry or otherwise used so obviously we've designed a vehicle that has an efficiency first kind of mantra in in the design and so we wanted to design a curved panel that would also be lightweight so that we could lean into the efficiency of the vehicle where we're at today we've passed reliability on the medium scale for 10 to 15 years we have ongoing testing for the full-scale panels and i'm actually sitting right in front of our low volume production line here so we've developed new production processes filed i think it's about 16 to 18 patent applications on our solar technology and we are producing panels using our production process trying to ensure that we have a very stable process that has a very high yield and we're improving the process integrating that into our what we call manufacturing execution system so that we have really good traceability on the manufacturing line of components their sources we can track down any issues in the process and we're building a robust manufacturing process that can scale for high volume next year so when we talk about solar i mean obviously most people's interactions with solar are either you know a big fenced off area of of a big grid scale solar or on their house on the roofs and people are starting to learn that some of the early installs of solar roofs weren't as efficient as they could be when you have different pitches and you have solar panels on different pitches of the roofs and if they aren't optimized properly and strung the right way then you don't end up with the most optimal solar collection how do you account for that on a vehicle that not only has you know a back and a front which are obviously in different planes but then also curved sections where every cell is going to be getting a slightly different exposure to the sun it's absolutely true that a mismatched shading or mismatched lighting conditions does change the output of a panel now inherently a vehicle will never be in the most optimal position for solar you know you're driving it north you're driving it south and some of our actual driving tests and what you might expect is true in that in the northern hemisphere you drive up a south facing hill and you get the most power output but we're actually able to have some accommodations in the design of the panel itself to better optimize for a vehicle scenario so what we're actually able to do is electrically separate different rings into zones of the vehicle so what you'll actually see is one area of the vehicle may be getting more light than another but those two different zones are actually performing a power conversion in isolation from one another so you actually won't hinder production of your solar power in one part of the vehicle just because another isn't necessarily facing the same lighting conditions it's led us to create a pretty elaborate charge controller that has several several different zones to uh to convert that that power to high voltage but it definitely helps improve the efficiency let's say we also have to face challenges of actually driving the vehicle while it's charging so you can imagine driving by a semi truck and it shades half of your panels as you drive by so our solar charge controller has to react really quickly to those conditions and that's why we've broken it up into several zones you know per panel and then the charge controller can make decisions okay this is receiving more i take the maximum power from that this is receiving less light take you know the maximum power from that at a lower charge but i think it's a complement to our electrical engineering team on how well that works it has extreme conversion efficiency compared to other solar devices and i i think it's uh you know it's an amazing piece of our solar puzzle yeah i love working with the electrical team because uh every time we get a new uh are performing a new test or get new boards in they to say oh it'll be five six weeks before we test this or before we've validated this component and then the next day i get a text message oh it all worked perfectly they all start cheering engineers the building but i think it's also a testament to the really good work that they've been doing will users get to as they say park it in their driveway get to see something that tells them oh if i turn my vehicle 15 more degrees that way it would maximize things you know is there some way that we can give feedback to drivers we've actually been working on some ui concepts on actually how to do that there are absolutely ways that we can collect the information and share the information that allows you to see okay what is the best uh you know angle to point your vehicle but also best inclination to also point your vehicle so we're doing some initial tests and integration of that ui at this point while also going out into the real world to collect and validate this data we'll figure out uh or define a bit later whether that's in our launch vehicle but it's absolutely something that we'll be looking into for uh for longer term integration yeah user interface will be terribly unique because you know app terra being the most efficient transportation device ever people are really going to care about how they use their energy per mile and we want to give them lots of information about where their energy is going but on the flip side it's the first vehicle to ever actually create its own fuel so people are really going to care about you know every photon that's turned into an electron people are really going to care about so we want to give them a lot of data on you know how they're producing electricity and also hopefully the system so they can see how other people in the aptera community around them are producing electricity and hopefully compete to make the most power with their aptera and do cool things with that power yeah i know that uh when i'm out myself testing it it's a lot of fun i start playing games with myself it's oh what if we go park on that hill over there we're gonna get more and i didn't expect it myself but you know i remember the first time we started doing this it's oh oh there's a cloud coming oh watch it drop that's so cool i mean you could even have ramped parking spaces where it's southern you know facing south and you're just and then you get the most sunlight every day that's so cool it's what a fun thing let's face it we park cars 95 of the time just the parking is now more fun instead of i put it over here hopefully nobody hits it now you're thinking it's doing something well i leave how fun we foresee a future where people are bringing rv ramps to their workplace so they can you know get another 10 degree you know while they're parked for work um so it's a very cool possibility can you imagine we're all around the water cooler so where'd you park today i know what can users expect to get for a real world range out of their solar panels have you been able to get you know get any numbers yet yeah i mean we actually still hold to that uh up to about 40 miles of range um so it's definitely a realistic based on what we're seeing in some of our test data when you make the cells more robust you you take down their efficiency you know every layer that you put over these cells increases their efficiency so i think a news looked at the initial problem he was you can take 20 of the power production right off the top because i'm gonna have to put all this stuff over these cells to make them safe and we said well how about we give you a couple more cells and he's oh well that one you know so yeah we've added to the solar cells and he's optimized you know his laminates um so it's not a 20 hit then i think we've kind of struck a nice balance uh to where we're kind of back where we started from yeah the other note there is that you really are going to have variable output through throughout the year in the winter when you're really not getting as much sun the output does get reduced a little bit but then in the summer where you have much longer days you'll be able to get much more solar so i'm looking forward to some of our continued testing over the next several months we're collecting data right now i'm going to continue testing that in a real world constant driver over the next several months to get that solar output and the cool thing is we we can run kind of a baseline here but the in-rail data national renewable energy labs has very good insulation data for all around the world we can basically you know plot power production you know for any day of the year you know any place in the world which a great tool for for future app terror owners now as you get closer to production i got to imagine if i was ceo i'd be worried that maybe i couldn't put solar on the first vehicles that it would bring the price up too much you know how definite are you that solar is going to go in these things from the very beginning or would it possibly be something that we'd get later on as an option yeah another challenge for a nuja's team we're we want all the solar he's oh we want to build all the solar uh you know the the fact is that about 80 percent of our customers want all the solar yeah so you know we feel it's important to launch the vehicle with all the solar that's our aspiration um you know we have we have many months to uh to challenge indonesia's team to get that done but as you said you know we're producing 10 panels a day now he's built all the different various panels you know the the hood the dash the roof and the tail he's already gone through that exercise so i think it feels very tangible now uh that we won't be just delivering apparas with solar dashes you know we will be delivering in solar now here's a tough one i am a big fan of arcimoto another three-wheeled electric vehicle they're having some troubles right now especially ramping up production they have plenty of people your company that love their product and want to get the product are you worried that you're going to be in a similar situation where a production just takes longer than you think i mean elon talks about it all the time how it's just a way harder problem than we all think you know where are you at in that process um you know i i should have little bracelets made you know what would sandy do that's kind of um you know our fallback on all these types of broad questions uh you know we're talking about how do we get our battery pack into production well the the final battery pack review was just done by sandy's team okay we have you know a pin in that we're going to you know production with this design because sandy's reviewed it and you know it's commoditized and it's manufacturable same thing with sandy's team helping solar same thing with sandy's team helping you know cpc execute on the body structures so in kind of all these pieces i think we have very good resources on these design for manufacturability which will hopefully quell a lot of the you know manufacturing headaches i would say if you're a company you know out there trying to scale try and engage andy's team uh because he will save you a lot of a heartache there is the only built here mentality you know you only want to trust your own engineers and kind of going outside is uncomfortable this is my eight startup i've never been blessed with the kind of knowledge that sandy has given aptera with my other companies um and you know just we have a manufacturing execution system operating at solar which gives us a data driven manufacturing environment from the start and you know to have that in my other companies would have just been amazing but we've had the foresight and you know consultation from sandy and pablo and his team um that have just said you know start it right start the factory to build ten thousand a year run a second shift to build 20 000 a year don't start building one a day and then try to ramp it to two a day because then you're asking everybody on the floor to double production and their heads explode they go i can't do produce twice as much or crazy then you want to go to four a day oh my god you know i'll never i'll never get to see my kids you know start the plant building 40 vehicles a day by all the infrastructure buy all the equipment by all the tooling train the people to build 40 a day and execute on that i think that's what we're what we're pacing to do here in the next few months we feel pretty lucky here on the show because we have all these spies that we send out they're basically our viewers and our spies have been in your vehicle and have sent back really glowing report so we had one guy i think he's six foot five and he was i was really worried because i have one in order and i didn't know if i'd fit and then he reported back i i fit with room to spare and i think it's amazing to a lot of people because they look at the vehicle and it's just hard to picture how they fit into it and stuff but we've been getting reports that it's just really easy to get in and out of it really feels great when you're in it how have you been able to do that yeah i mean uh jason hill and the design team has done an amazing job with you know really characterizing um you know the ergonomic needs of people uh the aptera is a unique vehicle uh you know the aerodynamic shape means you're kind of you know laid back more you're in a sports car than you would be in an suv so making that seating uncomfortable and making you know the steering angle and the vision system that's in front of you and now most of the functions for the vehicle there's only three buttons in the epterra there's two door buttons and a hazard switch those are the only buttons everything else is on the screen so you know accessibility to that screen and you know the ergonomics of that is super super important but you know it was eight months ago or so they had an interior buck up in la they had 150 people or so set in it and you know characterize everything and that's the knowledge that went into gamma to build up that interior so i think uh you know the the very first ones we built um the alpha series did not have the benefit of any of that we had to just make a lot of assumptions and just build that vehicle and you know it was functional and it was drivable but you know it was lacking in a lot of ways so you know we learned a lot from alpha and then we were able to you know really characterize beta and then all that knowledge fit into gamma so we were lucky enough to you know be at the fully charged show and you know have a have a great showing and we kind of brought our own fan base you know over 100 of our ambassadors flew in to see that vehicle and i think it was an amazing experience to see how people really interact with the vehicle you know hey you know this i could imagine sitting in the seat for 600 miles um you know i think that the visibility looks great i was worried you know that i wouldn't be able to see behind me and stuff that so it really is a credit to uh to jason and his team to work through all those details but it's coming together nicely one of the biggest topics at our lunch table here at now you know is aptera i've got to ask this question for our editor bobby he said you have to ask chris this question when am i getting my upterra and so i think the number one question a lot of people just want to know is when when will it be available so what is what are your thoughts on kind of general availability i know that california is going to get it first and that makes total sense but what are your thoughts on the next step outside of california you know uh everything on our our production ramp is funding dependent um so you know assured the funding gods open open up to us it takes pablo's team would tell you about seven months to start production from the time he gets his first equipment uh and you know a lot of those equipment you know it's big checks a million dollar checks to buy some of this equipment and tooling so um you know we we hope that uh we can bring the pieces of the funding puzzle together here towards the end of the year uh and be solidly in production uh in in 2023 um having said that you know if we build many vehicles in 2023 you know it depends on where you are on that list um you know will obviously deliver to california southern california first because those are going to be the people that are easy to get to and if we have early problems we really want to take care of those customers and we want to get feedback because you know a lot of other automotive style programs uh design a vehicle and put a pin in it and then do not change that vehicle for years into the future but i think uh you know giving tesla much credit in the way that they have rolling changes uh in their assembly line is uh is really cool you know they uh they they find a better product they find a better manufacturing method they find something that's better for the user and they just implement that so we want to do that too you know when we have the first 500 after on the road we're going to get a ton of feedback and you know somebody's going to say you know the position of this is ugh or you know the way this feels is uh and hopefully we can can make that better over time and really quickly so we think it's important to you know ship those first vehicles close to home but we want to be around the world as quickly as possible because you know we would love to you know have these vehicles in australia and you know in in england in europe and you know we think that they will really be advertising pieces almost everywhere that they go because um you know there's going to be nothing that's um more unique driving around the streets of wherever you are than in aptera so uh we hope to uh you know ship around the nation uh very quickly you know i would say in 2024 and then around you know soon after so um you know i i don't know where your producer is uh in the ranks of orders but obviously you guys will see some of the first vehicles uh because we want your feedback so uh talk to me a little bit about some of the funding puzzle pieces as you put it um you know what are some of the pieces that you're looking for are there uh you know people are watching at home and they're just how can i help i know a lot of people want to help as much as they can what are some of the things that they can do and also what are some of the um you know larger forces at play yeah we uh we currently have a crowdfunding open uh it's called a reg a plus tier two offering for the sec but that allows individuals with you know more than a thousand dollars to contribute to you know um a business that they are inspired by or um you know really want to uh to help foster that business model it could come with a thousand dollars and you can invest in early aptera uh you know wouldn't it have been nice to be able to invest in early tesla or early google uh but 10 years ago you know 15 years ago it just wasn't available there was no mechanism for people to invest in stuff that you had to be rich you had to be in a fund you know it just wasn't accessible to to common people but now since 2009 there was a jobs act passed and in 2015 the sec finally solidified instructions on how to use it and by 2017 it's okay people started to figure out okay this this would be called crowdfunding uh but it wasn't really until 2019 that anything kind of happened in the crowdfunding space so it's really kind of a new mechanism for people to invest in great ideas this but uh you know one way to support aptera is just go to invest.apterra.us and and invest we have over 15 000 investors uh supporting this project now which is just mind-boggling um you know but uh that's the first way the other pieces of that funding puzzle you know are more are larger checks basically uh high net worth people uh family offices uh venture capital uh institutional investors know those are the types of people that we're talking to now to get them many millions of dollars that we need to buy this big equipment and such so um if you uh if you know someone in that space um you know we say we're only one inspired billionaire away uh from having this company fully funded uh but it really is just that you know we think we're going to meet uh that right person that right fund uh that right institution that says solar mobility is the future i get it you know vehicles should be made for efficiency no there's a place for large suvs and pickup trucks in the ev market but we think you know really to move um this world forward there needs to be a large segment of vehicles that are focused on efficiency and we focus on efficiency first solar power is a nice you know attribute that we can add after and we think that it just makes the value proposition incredible you know from a business perspective you know hey zero fuel cost transportation uh you know that will change the world um anus a question for you um about the solar how much of this have you kind of learned on the job it seems the kind of thing where no one's done this before so it's not you can learn it in school solar you know vehicle 101 so what was it to be hired as head of solar did you just come in there with all these ideas and you knew what to do or did you have to and i know you're sitting next to your boss so just you can just just do this and just has a big old brain well so you know i think the the challenge of solar is one that's uh very well understood and that there are a number of limitations on uh you know how the environment impacts uh pre-existing solar cells and solar cell technologies um so you're actually able to operate within a somewhat reasonable framework and that very early on you can create uh let's say a target specification for the product in that hey we're creating a solar panel uh uses so solar cell technology that is a novel to an extent but also decently well understood and we have a couple new constraints for the weight of the product as well as the geometry that we're trying to match with that product so from that perspective uh the challenge ends up being i'd say twofold one is a material science challenge so you end up having a lot of material science to work on to try and create this lightweight product and the second is actually a manufacturing challenge i would say that a lot of our intellectual property is on the manufacturing side of these panels so when we first started this project to try and develop two access current solar it's okay let's define what our key challenges are what key metrics we want these solar panels to achieve and start doing the materials and manufacturing in order to achieve that now from my perspective i've been through production environments before and a lot of companies will fall prey to designing engineering without manufacturing in mind and so very early on the question that i had and i think i shared this in a recent was not how do we build one it was how do we build a thousand or a million of these and so we started to think about um both okay what are all the materials we can use and how would these fit into a high volume manufacturing process in the future what i'm actually really excited to be able to have achieved and it was not an easy thing to do is to actually have developed a manufacturing process that could actually enable a nearly 10 minute change over time if for example we wanted to use a seven layer stack up or a 12 layer stack up or a five layer we can actually we've worked on the materials and manufacturing side to be able to adapt our manufacture capturing process for any issues we might see in the field instead of having a two three week changeover on the on the line in just a few minutes you could replace some of the materials that you may have specified using our manufacturing process yeah we've operated within a framework of what our requirements are some of the environmental conditions that are very well known in solar as well as some of the new requirements or conditions that the panels would be exposed to in an automotive environment and we've been working on the manufacturing challenge from the very beginning which i think has really enabled us to you know have this low volume line here that's producing panels at the end of the day what if you just designed the aptera to have a flat section and you just slap a standard old solar panel on there call it a day and it works on the roof of a house for 20 30 years you should be good you pay a little more for the high efficiency maybe three 400 watts and and you go what what do we you know what are we wasting all this time and money for trying to develop curved panels we got flat panels all day and you know the back of the app tear is relatively flat who cares well why not do that so there are a number of reasons uh let's figure out where to start i think one is we we've really been trying to design the vehicle from an efficiency of our standpoint and there are two considerations there the first is the geometry of the vehicle leads to the geometry that we have or the aerodynamics of the vehicle leads the to the geometry that we have now and that really does lead to pretty dramatic curves in some areas where if you actually try to slap a flat panel in there you have to lower that panel to such a significant level that you start to to intrude into the cabin space or the space where a user's head might be for example the second is actually weight so if you start to slap a standard panel into into the aptera you add a lot of weight to the vehicle at that point you might end up having either a clear polymer or a glass-based shell over the panel and you already have a pre-encapsulated panel that's flat and has you know the resistance to oxygen water vapor you're doubling up on weight and really starting to slap together a solution rather than rather than build something that was designed for the aptera as a vehicle um so you know of course the challenge of manufacturing curved panels is one that well it's a challenge um but it enables us to create a better product as a whole one of the biggest questions we get back um i think has to do with the tesla charger a lot of people are are they going to be the first non-tesla vehicle with a tesla charger on board and where do you guys stand with that on the tesla charge plug you know we we had that petition uh we think that it's the best technology out there um you know slim form factor it just works we think that as a nation we would be better off if we adopted uh tesla supercharging infrastructure and just wrote elon a check say hey here and go let's go build this infrastructure for us you guys are the best at it you're doing it you know at a fifth of the cost of some of these other infrastructure projects so you know perfect make everybody tesla superchargers we are working still hard to have the best engineering in the aptera when it comes to charge plugs and adapters and we you know hope that in the next few months we'll be able to show and announce and you know talk about that further but that's our aspiration we're bleeding edge engineering and everything from solar to our in-wheel motors to our battery pack technologies to our body and carbon why should the charge plug be any different we think it should be bleeding engineering too and and tesla is that how hard is it to because i know that you're both very talented you know engineers and and business people and and it must be so tempting to just be i would love to jump down a rabbit hole of all the games we could play on the center console uh how hard is it to stay focused when you have this community of people who are so chomping at the bit and thinking so far outside the box of all the different ways that they could use their vehicles for fun um do you want to stay focused do you want to have all of these things to kind of look forward to is that another job you want you want to be upstairs i mean there's so many crazy fun things you know um well so on the solar end i think it's uh very exciting to think about all the new applications for our technology and the approach that i'll take um is i will you know i have a notebook where i keep track of all the new fun crazy ideas um and sometimes i'll spend a couple minutes a week and think about okay if this were something we wanted to implement in the future how would that affect my design today and if that is a very small requirement that's not actually a significant cost adder or uh it does not add a lot of engineering effort i'll actually incorporate some of those requirements into the design today so that maybe three years down the road we're starting to incorporate this new feature or this new value-add development and it would just enable that technology to be easier to implement in the future for other projects that may be much more cost or r d intensive honestly i'll simply take a note of it i think it's very nice to have this oh this is the future list but i think that we really are laser focused on getting this product out the door and we are trying to say okay what do we need to do today to build a robust solar product or aptera product so that we can get these in the hands of customers as soon as possible yeah luckily our engineering team and diablo's manufacturing team are well shielded from those uh you know from that kind of feedback you know are wonderful communications team uh fields most of that but uh but i love it i i relish that people are envisioning ftera in their lives and wouldn't it be cool if i had this wouldn't it be great if uh that means that they're really you know building you know their perception of the future around after [music] um so it's it's humbling to you know to think that we will be able to impact people's lives in terms of their impact on the planet in terms of how much money they have to spend on transportation decreasing their time on you know having to plug the vehicle in or fuel the vehicle you know all these things are impactful to people's lives and you know i think it's uh i just can't wait for the next five years to unfold and for us to have you know hundreds of thousands of attera on the road and to really make a difference in the world thank you guys thanks for taking time out of your busy days i know that you guys are super busy working on the ramp so thanks for talking to us today and for anyone watching who hasn't been to upterra's website yet i urge you to go over there check out all the different offerings use our referral code down below if you'd to um because yeah you got to get in line if you want to get one of the first ones yes sir um you guys are going to have a a wonderful lot of epterra hopefully to uh to test uh because of the referral code and i think that's just that's just awesome yeah i can't wait to have an app a parade that's going to be awesome yeah we're super excited and yeah we want to be your new england testers so we can tell you you know how it how it stands up to the new england roads and the new england weather pothole testing at his finest awesome thank you guys it's been a lot of fun thanks guys thank you guys appreciate it the future is bright back to work back to

five percent off your purchase today at bigbattery.com this week we wanted to bring you a really interesting person who's doing really amazing things you're about to meet our friend timmy devos who started a company called e-waste race now i didn't know this until i met timmy but there is 54 million metric tons of e-waste generated worldwide every year for most people when they're done with a piece of electronic gear what do they do well either you probably set it aside right hoping that someday it'll somehow become valuable maybe my iphone 4 will be valuable when i sell it on ebay someday or they're a little more realistic and they just throw it away anyway this is where timmy comes in i met timmy during our european model 3 road trip when we were in the netherlands and the last time i saw timmy he was hanging off the back of our model 3 on his skateboard so timmy tell us about e-waste race and how it works the e-waste race in principle is an education project so we have in a city or region we have 10 schools participating to compete against each other and collect as much e-waste as possible so we can bring it back into the loop for reuse repair recycling with e-waste it's mainly recycling because a lot of all discarded electronics can't be easily repaired or can't be easily reused so that's the basics but we have a technology layer on top of it so we built a website where people can offer their old electronics for pickups by the kids so the kids engaging campaigns going in the neighborhood to tell everybody about the importance of e-waste recycling people go to our website they want to get rid of vacuum cleaners water cookers you name it and the kids pick it up at your home and the nice thing about the system is that it keeps track of the score from a day-to-day basis so you can see which school is in number one two three till ten the competition takes four weeks and the school that gets the best score in those four weeks wins a super cool school trip which is often a science museum which is kind of in theme of the the whole topic okay so what happens to the e-waste once it's all collected we work together with local waste collectors and municipalities so our clients are often local governments so municipalities and they already have contracts with waste collectors and producer responsibility schemes so in europe we have a producer responsibility we have to collect a certain amount of electronics to reach targets for sustainability purposes these producers are together in a collective and they can be our sponsor so it's either that a producer collective or the municipality or the local waste collector so we work together with them and the infrastructure then is already in place with collectors and recyclers so we collect at the schools and we arrange pickups on a weekly basis at the schools and from there it goes to a municipality depot and from there it's being sorted and it goes to uh specific recycle recyclers for specific types of waste so mobile phones go somewhere else than cables so you've got producer incentives in europe but do you think that this would work for american schools too i'm 100 sure i think if we look at kids in europe i mean i'm not very familiar with american kids but sustainability is so much more of a topic than it was back even when i was young so i think if we tell them about the importance of resource scarcity about e-waste dumping in third world countries as soon as you make the topic clear to them and what kind of issues are at play in the world they will very much be willing to participate in this uh kind of project and contribute to a better environment so how much e-waste do you typically collect in a competition of four weeks with 10 schools we collected on average 14 000 kilos of electronic waste so i mean i remember when i was a kid and i think it was for soccer or something they had us you know go out into your neighborhood and sell candy bars and uh you might win a bike the first day i was oh my gosh i can i could i could maybe i could do something so i'm who where do i go first of all because i can't go walking down the street i get hit by a car and i was okay so i'm gonna sell them uh i think i got my mom to buy one candy bar cause she was very nice um and then i went back to soccer practice the next day and i knew that i was not gonna win that bike i was oh there's no point i should just eat the rest of the sample candy bars that they gave me because there's no way i'm going to win this bike because my friend whose mom wanted him to win the bike brought him all around and got all of her friends to buy him the candy bars so you're blaming me is what you're doing no it was a dumb system and and so what i'm really wondering is is how do you get this much engagement from these kids one very important thing about the whole project is it's not on an individual basis so you're not competing to sell candy bars with your other classmates or kids from other schools you engage in the competition with your whole class and you have different incentives built in so one is winning the cool school trip which besides a science museum is also a day off of school but besides that it's super cool that you win it all together and you go on this school trip with the whole class and besides that we very much know this and it might sound cheesy but the actual impact that they make for the environment and also uh we also tell them something about labor conditions in third world country countries while mining for the resources in our electronics so um even if they don't win we basically see all the schools and they keep working very hard to collect as much as possible so even if they're in place number nine or 10 they know they won't be winning the race anymore but they keep on collecting for the full four weeks so it's not only the school trip it's it's it's also contributing to something really nice and having the the group feeling we also work with different roles for different students so they can work on something they want to learn or something they want to develop wow i mean that's amazing because you're not just incentivizing the students for their own gain but you're also teaching them empathy or maybe not even teaching them empathy but just using exercising the empathy that they already have so how do you educate the students we go to the schools and actually provide a physical guest lecture so now during covert times that's a bit more difficult and we do it through a call as we do now we do it in in a story mode so first we tell them where our electronics come from so they're being sourced in mines so we tell them something about uh what that looks and what the negative impacts are on the making of electronics so we're talking resource scarcity we're talking about mining conditions that aren't always as nice then we tell them about the actual lifetime of our electronics so if if we look at the netherlands half of our electronics aren't being collected for recycling so they either stay in your drawer or they stay in your attic or they end up in residual waste bins which means the things get burned and then these scares and valuable resources are gone and we also tell them something about e-waste dumping so the the the old electronics ending up in places where you really don't want to have them so we go through this whole story and then from the problem statements you go to but we can help if this half of electronics that isn't being collected if we would collect that and we cannot do it by ourselves we need to involve the whole city then we really make an impact and this really fires them up and that's what we see in our results and the thing to me that's so interesting is that you're not coming at them with oh and then you give it to the e-waste fairy and the e-waste fairy takes it to heaven or something that if there's no you know big round fat man dressed in a red suit that's going to come ho ho ho i love me some e-waste thank you students how important do you think it is to tell these kids the truth about e-waste uh very much i i think we shouldn't uh see kids as people that are in for inferior to adults actually these are young human beings that can have enormous thrive to do good for the world and they have a tremendous ability to engage other people i mean if i would go to my neighbors and tell them yeah we have some issues in the world and we really have to do something about it they're not very likely to listen to me or change their behavior if a 12 year old kid comes up and tells them hey if you hand over your e-wastes that you're not using anymore then we can make a contribution to the world then you're way more inclined to to help them we should treat children as as people that can actually make a very valuable contribution they're not any less smart than us so we should tell the true story i mean they're the consumers of the future and they have to know uh what the world looks and uh work towards a better one all right so what are your plans for the future with e-waste race we want to grow internationally so in the netherlands we already got one third of the market culvert so to say and we recently started a franchise ship in germany and that's actually already going quite well and we expected to grow quite rapidly as well and now we want to do the same thing in other european countries so basically we're looking for two things franchise partners willing to set up this project in other countries and on the other hand yeah we have to start off with launching customers so either municipalities that want to take the leap or producers or recyclers that are willing to sponsor the races and the second is uh we're also diversifying to other material streams i i rather say so last year we launched our pilots for the textile race and they were a tremendous success already so with the textile race we have managed to put more focus on higher strategies of circularity for example repair works way better for the textile race during the textile race we had hundreds of repairs so kids stitching up holes in their sweaters or in their trousers which is beautiful in terms of sustainability and above expectations we already uh have uh about 20 municipalities willing to participate in the textile race now so you're looking for partners in europe right now what kind of quality should they have and how can they reach out to you if they're interested in working with e-waste race we're looking for two kind of partners for the franchise partners it's best to have companies or organizations already involved in education projects so that can be rolling out any kind of education project but have some experience in working with kids because we would to have local organizations to organize the whole project we can supply them with our website our education material material our flyers our booklets everything but basically we want the other organizations in place to profit from this business model themselves and have a small fee for using all our setup materials and the other one is yeah is the sponsors [music] that can be someone working at a local municipality working on waste issues or on sustainability circular economy but it can also be someone in the csr department of a big electronics producer wow i love bringing you inspirational people timmy he inspires me and i hope he inspires you i mean if you pitched the average person this concept that he came up with e-waste race they would have every reason under the sun of why it wouldn't work well how are the kids gonna do the thing and i don't think that there's gonna be a center programmable blah blah kids can't carry everything right all the reasons why you think it wouldn't work and so what timmy has done by doing this is he proved that you can do it i mean so many of us want to do great and amazing things and when we talk about it to other people we so often get shot down well you couldn't do it because of that reason you go oh okay i guess i guess it's impossible and i'm stupid for thinking that way what this shows to me is that if you're committed to doing something that you can do it um and that all this naysaying stuff it's just a load of junk because and we've seen this too with tesla right people oh electric cars who needs uh their golf carts blah blah blah elon was committed to that goal he made electric cars work it's so inspiring to see someone timmy devos make something e-waste race and then make it happen now there is a part of this equation which doesn't work in some places and i'm talking about us here in the us there is no incentive here in the u.s and even if timmy had e-waste race here and the kids collected all this e-waste and they wanted to recycle it properly it's still cheaper to dump it in a landfill or incinerate it here in the u.s and that's what we need to fix here we need to be looking into laws that make the producers and the u.s consumers pay for the recycling before we even buy this stuff and i know you're probably saying so you want it to cost more and yes i want it to cost a few cents more to make something this okay because when i'm done with this what am i gonna do with it i don't know what to do with it it's got plastic it's got metal it's got all sorts of stuff in it i don't know where to throw it i'm gonna throw it in the trash it's gonna go in an incinerator i don't want that to happen i want the producers to have figured out how to do something with this to get it back to all of its valuable stuff there's valuable stuff in here and i think that we're approaching the world in in really the wrong way you wouldn't go to a hotel where it was really cheap but they don't clean up after the people who are in the hotel room uh before you uh that would not be any place you'd want to go to let me see what that would be wow jesse look this room is nine bucks a night yeah uh except uh the sheets are just come on right you're better off sleeping in your car right right and so why don't we do the same mental calculation in our mind when we're talking about e-waste well it's just because that messy room will end up somewhere else and we don't have to worry about it and we can just write it off and i think that that is the wrong way to go about it and of course the people who want you to throw it away and don't want to pay for it um they are going to throw all the well collection's gonna be a real issue how would we possibly get these things back and it's really nice to have e-waste race to say uh no you're absolutely wrong look at this company who's doing that part of the issue all we need now is a small incentive for that to happen exactly so we want to give a huge shout out to timmy for the amazing work he and his company are doing and to all the schools and students who have collected all these tons of e-waste for recycling and if you want to partner with e-waste race you'll find the link to their website down below reach out to them don't be shy if you want to see our entire interview and there are some great sections there that we had to kind of cut out for time where we get to learn more about what got timmy started on his journey you'll want to check out our disruptive investing where we have not only this full interview with timmy but dozens of other interviews with innovative and disruptive companies and thought leaders who are working hard to make our world more

version of the app in 1869 john wesley hyatt created the first synthetic polymer it was to save the elephants or rather to meet with the demand of ivory which recently spiked with the popularity of billiards celluloid was the first commercially available plastic then with the introduction of bakelite in 1910 and further plastics and synthetic rubbers invented to aid in war efforts plastic established its foothold of useful cheap lightweight and mass producible products with excellent chemical stability and durability luxurious looking surface finishes and vibrant colors plastic was great and they were about to get even better with the addition of glass fiber reinforcement plastics could be stronger massive plastic companies sprung up and were able to spend billions of dollars on developing newer better plastics employing thousands in creating a gigantic global industry and the best part was when you were done using your plastic bottle or saran wrap you simply and hygienically threw it away in a plastic trash bag pretty soon we could cut labor costs by having people in far away places make us our plastic products making them even cheaper and more disposable we continue to increase plastic production steadily year over year and through the strange quirk of chemistry disposed plastic never seemed to disappear when this first began to be discussed in the 1960s it was roundly ignored by the plastics industry when it continued to be something people were alarmed about the society of the plastics industry answered their fears in 1988 with the adoption of the pic or plastic identification code which they simply copied from the american automotive industry the code identified every type of plastic polyethylene tetraphthalate high density polyethylene polyvinyl chloride low density polyethylene polypropylene polystyrene and other which helpfully includes any mix of the plastics above and also polymethyl methacrylate polyoxymethylene bpa containing polycarbonate and bpa-free polycarbonate which uses bps instead of bpa which is also a health hazard acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and thousands of different kinds of plastics all under the helpful term other number seven but at least the six numbered plastics are the most prevalent and recyclable all right so how does that work well when you drop off your plastic waste into one of those blue or green bins it goes to a murph or materials recovery facility there with the help of automated processes and low-wage workers your recycling gets sorted the glass and metals are separated from the plastic and then a majority of the plastic gets thrown away what thrown away well p-e-t or number one what soda bottles are made out of is the most recycled plastic being able to be turned into carpets and clothes and sometimes even part of a new water bottle but most of the stuff that gets put in your bin is sorted and then thrown away only nine percent of plastic is recycled and when they can't put the bales of plastic into a landfill they will sometimes burn it or up until recently they would pack it up on a ship and send it to china up until recently in the past few years china has stopped accepting our waste plastic so we've tried shipping it to sri lanka thailand philippines and turkey but no one seems to want it anymore so it continues to pile up and of course it doesn't just pile up in special landfills far away from people or nature it ends up in the oceans since everything flows into them and plastics can't evaporate and be part of the water cycle there's about 1400 garbage trucks full of plastic added to the ocean every day and remember when i told you that plastic was very chemically stable and didn't break down well that was under ideal conditions you see in the ocean plastic is exposed to lots of sunlight that can degrade the plastic causing it to lose strength and break into smaller pieces this continues to happen over time until you're left with tiny little pieces of colorful plastic floating around the ocean it almost looks fish food well funny you should mention that we're gonna stop here this particular pandora's box would take more time than we have today to fully get through and leave everyone feeling a little too depressed right i mean on earth we're closing in on 10 billion metric tons of plastic that we created even if we were to stop making plastic tomorrow the plastic that would be left over even if it was melted down and we've made it into a one centimeter thick sheet it would cover roughly all of france twice wait a second the country of france you could cover it with it's it's if a giant came along and said hey honey will you wrap up france i can eat it tomorrow just make sure you put two layers of saran wrap over it i mean we're talking about thick i mean one centimeter thick plastic that you're thinking of linoleum flooring we could basically do all of france in not necessarily linoleum flooring but recycled plastic flooring maybe they want to do that i don't know all right so how can we get rid of this much plastic well we were lucky enough to talk to someone who's working on that problem this is liz madaras the co-founder and ceo of polyloop well thank you for having me uh what we're working on is basically a technology which allows us to take oil fossil based plastics back into the environment we have created a cocktail of bacteria that has the ability to biodegrade fossil based plastics this allows us to take plastics back into the environment to which they once belonged eons ago okay so slow down here bacteria that can eat plastic how does that work and what are we left with after the plastic has been eaten it's very similar to composting because even there you take a long chain molecule a polymer and then microbes start breaking it down and using it as a food source and in the end and in the case of composting as well you you're left with water vapor uh biomass and a bit of carbon dioxide and it's the same in our process but we use plastics and not leaves for our compost bin isn't there more value in recycling the plastic back into usable products why not just recycle it all because it's impossible to recycle all the plastic and the technology isn't isn't there there are good mechanical recycling technologies for certain types of plastics but sadly more than 90 percent of plastics doesn't even end up at a recycling facility it gets dumped or incinerated and we have been working on on bioplastics and composes compostable plastics as an alternative and what we're offering is to actually make these oil-based plastics compostable wouldn't it be easier to just burn all the plastic the same reasons for which we can't burn all the cold or all the oil we suffocate uh it's uh it's not a very environmentally friendly uh alternative to getting rid of plastic waste i do not support support burning of of plastic i don't think it's uh it's safe for our planet and it's not safe for us either we created a problem with plastics and we must solve it as well and by creating another problem with burning them we're doing more more harm than good and i mean if you were to burn it all it would release roughly over 23 gigatons of co2 that's equivalent to the annual co2 emissions of the top 10 emitting countries in the world combined wow that's also ignoring the hydrochloric acid sulfur dioxide dioxins furons heavy metals and other particulates that would come off polluting our air all right what about burying it all but you shouldn't it's bad it's bad for you it's bad for your family it's bad for the environment we gotta do something with plastics they don't belong in the environment the way they are right now we can transform it into something which does belong in the environment if it's not transformed don't put it into the environment it's just we should stop with that totally but wouldn't letting the bacteria eat the plastic basically composting it emit just as much co2 as burning it of course you're left with some carbon dioxide but the amount of carbon dioxide emitted through these bacterial processes is much less than through incineration or chemical recycling or some other dubious methods of plastics recycling yes we're also left with water vapor and and the the biomass which contains all the nutrients and all the carbon that was once stored in in the plastic but now it's in a bioavailable form and it can potentially be used to to actually help our crops grow make them healthier and thus actually uh sequestering the carbon that we emitted during the process because that's the golden standard for us to be absolutely co2 neutral maybe even negative but but neutral is is is a very um healthy goal so what would your system look scaled up we envision it as something between a composting facility and a water waste treatment plant we have incorporated elements from both of these things into our technology because we we had to come up with something which didn't exist before but it doesn't mean that we cannot build on what has already been invented and so are we gonna still have to sort all of this plastic you can work with mixed plastic waste um and that's the beauty of this technology because there's no need for sorting a lot of plastic gets lost because you cannot sort it out of the lower value plastics and we've thrown everything at these bacteria which you can throw into your bin as well and they they work well with all types of plastics you throw out from your kitchen and we're also currently expanding into plastics which are not single used maybe plastics which are used in your car as well and we hope that we can get to a point where we um we can actually deal with eighty percent of the plastic we throw away be it single use or not what if your bacteria escapes the system is that the end of plastics as we know it it's not going to get out of the lab and even if it does get out of the lab it needs our specialized conditions to actually eat plastic it's we can store it in plastic containers as long as we don't give it a specialized environment we use uh plastic pipettes as well in the laboratory and they don't just start eating that because they're not in their in their home okay so i want to stress that it's not we told you about poly loop and this is a silver bullet and we can all just start throwing plastics anywhere we want this is still a serious problem and we're still going to have a plastics pollution problem in the oceans for instance because that plastic wasn't collected properly to begin with most of that plastic in the ocean wasn't stuff you put out in your recycle bin that was stuff that was just dumped into rivers and made its way to the ocean exactly so the fight for plastics is not over we should not be all you know lounging around and saying oh i'm glad that's all over any oil-based plastics are not going to break down in the environment you have to collect them you have to bring them to poly loop but at least there is this option before it was do we bury it do we burn it um there was hardly any recycling that took place and yes i want more recycling as well i think that you know we shouldn't be pulling more oil out of the ground if you were to recycle it that's that's better but to have an option where you can take mixed plastics especially where you're just i don't know what's in here throw it into a composter basically and ha and get soil out um is such a better solution than burning it or putting it into landfill but we do need to worry about collection but if we don't do collection it would be better to have plastics that can break down naturally so i mean we are working on bioplastics uh these are plastic that you know pla that are made from corn and stuff that and those do break down in the environment albeit slowly but at least uh there are bacteria in the world that can break those down i think it's interesting to note here that the plastics industry itself the petrochemical industry didn't come up with liz's solution here polyloop is this small little company that came up with a solution we're seeing commercials all the time for exxon and it shows all of these uh people in lab coats and lab equipment and they're studying things and they're we're making a better tomorrow they're not doing this because they have no incentive to do this they don't want your plastic to break down they want to just make more plastic so interesting that we bring you these little companies that are trying to solve the problem and we discussed a lot more with liz that you can find out about by going over to the disruptive investing the disruptive investing is a that we started um we've been interviewing lots of different ceos ctos presidents um and it's it's been really really eye-opening for me uh and i really want to thank the community for allowing us to do this uh you know a lot of these companies would turn us away if we didn't have enough subscribers and and uh you know views on particular videos um so to that end if you would hit the button that would help us out a lot and definitely go check out the disruptive investing for the full interview with liz and there's plenty of other interviews that we have conducted over there that you can watch in their entirety and i also want to thank the now you know investor club right now the disruptive investing is not making us any money you know all of those videos have not been monetized mainly because we can't because we started a brand new and the now you know investor club have allowed us to do this and we in return we've tried to do as much as we can so we have a slack with all sorts of investing topics uh that you know 1400 people are discussing all the time and we bring interviews this to them a few days early so that way they can watch it themselves and learn a little bit ahead of time yeah now you probably haven't heard of poly loop and this is one of their first interviews in fact they're an early stage company that we found out about because of our amazing community and that's the really cool part here is that if we're one of the first channels to bring you companies this that means that you're one of the first people in the world who know about this and it's not to say that you can invest in poly loop this second they're an early stage company but if you keep your eye on them who knows where they're going to go in the future and who knows if this process is going to work if it does this could be revolutionary so thank you so much for watching this episode of in depth we bring it to you every single week along with tesla time news every monday so if you haven't already consider

think there's anything that we need to talk about beforehand i think we just get straight into it yeah i'm so fortunate today to have with us tom zaki's the ceo and founder of loop and of terracycle these are two companies that we've been following for a long time and i've got tons of questions for tom because i've actually used both these products so um yeah i just want to jump right in thank you so much for being here with us today well thanks for having me real pleasure well i guess i'd love to jump in first on terracycle um that's i think the company you started first um can you tell us what terracycle is and what you guys are up to today yeah absolutely so in its core terracycle is a waste management company we've been around for 20 years now national in 20 countries and what we try to do is really two things first and what you probably uh what most people may know us for is help recycle those things you can't locally recycle and so we have recycling programs for everything from cigarette butts to dirty diapers and hundreds and hundreds of other waste streams all over the world and then the second thing we do is try to help companies integrate waste into their products so they're making their products from unique uh forms of recycled waste so everything from ocean plastic to rock and roll festival waste to even the garbage on the top of mount everest uh just to name a few examples so that's basically what terracycle is all about i guess i'm gonna date myself a little bit here when we used to collect stuff in the schools in my town and at the farmer's market a lot of things i remember that we would kind of uh tell the public about was we would take things that were really hard to recycle and no one would take things juice pouches which i'm dating myself because they're not that popular anymore and that those could be made into we had some juice pouch bags i remember that we'd show people um i think where a lot of people get stuck and i get stuck is when you look at a toothpaste um tube or you look at you're talking about a dirty diaper it's come on you're not really recycling this um can you tell us give us some examples yeah what do you do when you get those boxes full of stuff that can't be recycled totally well why don't we do this you give me a waste stream and i'll tell you what we do okay dirty diapers i can't believe you do anything with dirty diapers okay so each type of garbage i'll give you the preface once and then we'll go a bit more rapid fire but each type of garbage is a unique animal uh but it is an animal nevertheless it's a type of garbage and the two really three questions that have to be solved to make something a dirty diaper become recyclable is how do we collect it how do we process it and then actually the most important part is how do we construct the business model where someone's going to fund it right and actually pay for it so let's talk dirty diapers so dirty diaper recycling is now live in amsterdam uh we've been running it there for a few years and actually it's now growing it's gonna be launching soon in japan and in france uh not yet in the us um the collection i mean it's literally a show right so we have to have uh um these smart bins you know that are very much smell control because you can imagine if wherever you put them at a retailer at a nursery and think hot summer you know everything that can make something festy we really put a lot of innovation into making sure that you could walk by it and never know it was there we have a special bin that we you know that we ask consumers to put any brand of diaper into and then we service those and it goes over to a facility where now diapers we always look at can it be reused dirty diapers not really can it be upcycled that's the example you gave of the juice pouches into backpacks not really so we then uh at the bottom would be recycling where we look at how do we rip it apart and take apart all the materials so diapers first go through a sterilization process then from there they get shredded and separated into what it's made from so diapers are made from cellulosic materials the fluffy stuff you also got this crystal inside called sap or super absorbent polymer that absorbs the urine basically and it's those crystals that when you put liquid to it get very big and then there's basically plastics all the sheetings are polypropylene or other forms of plastic and when you shred it you can separate those things and reconstitute each not necessarily to make a new diaper but those crystals are really good in the agriculture industry you know to hold water right uh especially in more uh areas that are a bit more arid um the cellulosic material can be made into new cellulosic material and the plastics can be recycled into rigid plastic products and net net that's diaper recycling and then i mentioned the third and important part is in that example pampers is who funds the bill and they're doing it hoping that you may prefer their brand over the competition because they're offering diaper recycling there's a bit more logic to it but that's the simplification i okay so this is making sense to me that if i'm a plastics manufacturer or a company pampers and i can put on my box you know can be recycled through terracycle you know more customers are going to want to come to me exactly and then you know we do have to really uh help the brands you know think about how to bring that to life because the more they see value the more they're going to grow it all over the world and this is the trick to sustainability if you're impregnating sustainability into business is the more you let the business know how it's going to drive traditional points of value right increase market share you know uh whatever it may be that's what's going to then make them be wow i'm not doing this because i'm protecting against the risk but i can lead with it and instead of doing marketing dollars i can you know do it here and that's how the platforms really fundamentally grow so instead of there being a diaper tax and we're gonna tax every diaper that gets sold and it's gonna put it into a diaper recycling fund or something that then you'd have businesses basically trying to get around it so it'd be oh these aren't diapers these are natty packs and they're for your little munchkins they're munchkin holders you know and then it's okay so they're trying to get around it or they're trying to get out of it or um it'll be very unpopular and people will be the diaper tax is going to make diapers more expensive for everybody and that's unacceptable so you're kind of circumnavigating all of those problems that when we try and solve them through government which is where you kind of think hey this is the government we solve problems that normally businesses don't solve because profit drives everything and if if we don't have to deal with dirty diapers then that's great we can just wash our hands of that and you just put it in the trash and whatever instead you're flipping it on its head and saying oh i might actually want to buy the diapers if i know that you're appealing to the the consumer to do the right thing right yeah and i think all these factors come into play right it's it's not one or the other so for example america is not great at legislating waste solutions in fact in you know you could say a lot of the things about america worth the only wealthy country that doesn't right and fill in the blank health care and and other things but it's also the only developed country it doesn't have what's called extended product responsibility taxes so everywhere else if you make a package you have to do what you just described and pay a tax and that money is used to help boost recycling rates an important backdrop here just to sort of you know jump on this if i may is that what makes something recyclable is not whether it can be right that's what we usually think it's recycles are recycling what they can and if the stuff that you can't recycle it's not it's because it can't be there's some technical wizardry issue it's the recyclers are not in the business of that they're in the business of extracting from your waste what is valuable and selling it and what is not valuable they won't bother it's urban mining right so when you put something in the recycling bin what happens a garbage company picks it up and they take it to a thing called the murph which is basically a sorting center and it gets on a conveyor belt and either robots or people usually people sort out the stuff they can sell at a profit and that then actually goes to what you would call a recycler who melts it down and makes it into something new but it's really mining for value right and what makes that diaper or chewing gum or razor blade or i mean you know list off most objects in the world not recyclable is simply the opposite it costs more to collect in process and the results are worth and so we somehow have to tease out whether in countries europe maybe through legislation in countries america maybe more voluntarily someone who would happily say i'm going to pay for that i see so the example that i gave you the reason i gave you that example is because i'm american and so when i think of oh well we could pass that legislation my first thought is that that'll never pass that'll never go through it'll ray okay but if i but stay with the american americans are great capitalists if you're a retailer right and i can tell you hey if you run recycling for let's say you're a cosmetic boutique for cosmetics and that gets people into your store you may be wow i can drive foot traffic through recycling maybe better than if i can uh run a tv commercial or run a coupon something that actually doesn't even make the world any better just you know it's straight marketing right and so for me whatever tools i can lever whatever i can sort of put on the table the more i can do the bigger these recycling programs become it sounds to me now after doing this for decades right you're in the second decade of doing this it must you've learned some tricks i'm sure and it's probably a little easier when you approach a company you know procter gamble or some big company you're let's do this because you can point to all these successes but what was it when you first started because i know that you got into waste in an unexpected way maybe you could talk about your early years yeah it definitely has been different um and there's a lot of i mean that's one of the nice things is you mature as a business you know you're it gets easier to grow right so i'm originally from hungary i only mentioned that because communists when i was born there right and uh i was born in 82 chernobyl happened you know we escaped as refugees uh one sort of as you know across europe and then canada and then i went down to university in new jersey which is where i'm speaking to you from today i now live here and uh i fell in love with entrepreneurship you know along the way i mean of course from communism to capitalism it's the best thing ever it's literally the american dream and you know fast fastest route in my eyes to fame and fortune right and i remember this sort of moment um the first class i took at princeton was econ 101 and the professor gets up on stage and says what's the purpose of business right that's a very appropriate sort of opening question and the answer she was looking for was maximize profit to shareholders which is the textbook definition and i get it i'm not anti-profit but is that i bet you most people who interact with a company customers employees don't care about that at all they care about what service is provided or what product you know is is given and then profit maybe is more accurately an indicator of health right if you're profitable you can flourish and grow and if you're not the opposite happens and so i was sort of thinking about how to create a business i was just searching for this idea a business topic that put purpose first but did that at a profit so it could flourish and grow and um you know i fell into this sort of garbage topic i mean my friends uh this was before pot became a bit more um you know legalized let's say and uh they were growing plants in their basement they couldn't really make it was up in montreal and they called me one day and they said they finally figured it out so of course i get in my car drive up you know from new jersey and uh yes they were absolutely right plants were doing great we enjoy had a good night and then i asked him how did you make it work and they said we took organic waste fed it to worms took the worm poop and fed it to the plants and that was awesome but then it started you know getting this idea of garbage in my mind and garbage is the strangest topic filled with so many anomalies so i give you just a couple just to sort of wet the noodle right we live in a pretty materialistic world but isn't it weird that in such a world everything we own and think literally everything the shelves behind you the floor you know on that you know not just the obvious stuff a you know a candy wrapper everything will be property of a garbage company with no exception everything we possess in a world where our worth is somewhat linked to what we possess they will own it all and 99 within the year we purchased it wait a minute say that again 99 99 of what we buy will be property of a garbage company within the year it was bought is that by mass is that by item i've heard that statistic by dollar by how you how money is spent but i mean think about it most of what we buy are consumables yeah and even the things that we perceive as durables clothing have become consumables right here's a sort of a neat stat on that if you were if we were around 100 years ago um it's i know it for women not men but an average woman you know middle income would have bought two apparel items per year and used them for 20 years uh you know before they became rags today 100 years later it's 66 apparel items per year are purchased and worn three times on average before disposal everything is moving in that direction right wow and so yeah it's insane so for me when you see something that when you solve it and it's purposeful it's a huge playground to play in and since no one's innovating the types of things we can do are really fun i mean you can it's imagine if you had the internet and no one else was playing on it early years you figure out that vermicomposting is awesome waste streams are awesome but how did you how did you start a business how did you get the first company to be sure i'll give you my uh i'll take back my juice packs or i'll give you money to to take my juice packs how did you how did you convince them to do that right as you described we first started as a worm poop company right i i dropped out of school and literally what terracycle was was taking organic waste feeding it to worms packaging it in use soda bottles and selling it at whatever home depot right that was our business and we grew in over four years doing that and then we started thinking could we make other products out of garbage right literally juice pouches into backpacks and so as we started doing that and we were able to get them sold we had to go find the waste and that's how we actually sort of invented these national recycling programs was by going to actually the first company ever i think it was companies clif bar and uh capri sun and a few others who said could we run a collection program so we can help make these products and then what happened is we realized that we had put the product as the hero of our business let's make a thing and then find garbage to make it where the product is the hero right and we and as we started learning about you know recycling and and uh and and also what's you know what what's happening in the scale at which it's happening with consumer product goods the immense size of waste is just unbelievable we realize that we should shift the hero of the equation away from the product to the garbage so instead of starting with i want to make a product and then what garbage can i make it was i need to solve this type of garbage and then what can i make it into it may seem similar but it's a fundamental shift and then the whole thing just took off from there um and has grown into you know sort of where we are now at the beginning you know it's you gotta macgyver your way into all this and you're uh you know just barely uh uh you know able to get the meetings let alone sort of beg for business but i'd say the biggest lesson i've learned in working with corporations around this topic getting them to voluntarily fund not you were describing have it taxed or legislated is not to lead with you should do this because you're polluting the world right and you should take responsibility which is the usual social business point of view to do it and honestly that's what i care about but instead to say how do i help you achieve what you're trying to achieve whatever your business goals are but show you you can achieve that by doing something purposeful running a big recycling program instead of um you know launching tv commercials that you know um may not necessarily do anything special just communicate your product and the more we did that the more companies said oh these guys get what we're trying to achieve and we'd of course love to do in a way that makes the world better than in a way that it doesn't move the world forward and what i love about terracycle is that it takes a lot of people to make it work in a community if they want to do one of your programs but it raises money so a lot of kids are excited about you know hey kids gather up this junk this trash um and let's recycle it and then they get excited about it and i've seen kids just come alive and just go pick up throughout their neighborhoods barrels and barrels and stuff that would have gone into the you know the landfill of the incinerator and now turned it back into you know useful stuff and shout out to jerry and christina uh to the the best people in our community who do that um and it's it's just amazing what you can do to in a school for instance you know one week the kids are just throwing that stuff in the trash the next week it's gold you know we've been as a small company we've donated just under 50 million dollars in these in exactly what you're describing right and i think we need to to enable recycling which is the first step in a sustainable journey you know before someone may cut out meat may live in a small house you know may do things that are bigger lifestyle changes recycling is where we begin so we got to do that well and it's not just about making things available but we have to make them fun and we have to get people excited because that actually gets more momentum uh than just saying here's a bin and i hope you use it now let's move on to your second company loop that's another product and service that jesse and i have tried um and so to describe this to to people who are watching so that you know they know what loop is absolutely so loop is a platform for reuse what it does is uh it enables consumer product companies to create reusable versions of their products think thai laundry detergent and reusable stainless steel or your you know ice cream with hug endos also in beautiful reusable packaging and then you can buy that either in-store or online from your favorite retailers here in the us kroger and walgreens and ulta beauty just to name a few examples or even burger king and uh you pay a deposit on the package when you get it and then when you return it not just to the retailer you purchase but any retailer you get your money back and then instead of that package being you know garbage or even being recycled it goes to a state-of-the-art cleaning facility where it's cleaned and then the company refills it and sells it to someone else it's sort of how the milkman model worked back in the day but imagine meeting everything i mean literally you know almost any consumer product uh and coming to life in uh in in retailers um so that's basically how how it works and it launched about two and a half years ago and has been on sort of a whirlwind of growth it's now up in four countries launching two months from now in japan and then australia and uh hopefully bringing a very convenient reuse opportunity to folks so it's easy to play in reusables without having to wash out your own bottle take it to a refill station and also really get get the brands you know people want and already consume so i mean i think the people are used to uh deposits especially in the united states you know there's bottle deposits and you can you know drive it all the way to where is it maine and get 10 cents you know um but usually that's that's not being reused it's just being recycled they're gonna take it they're gonna grind it up and then they're gonna melt it down and turn it into something new this is a departure from that and so you're paying a bigger deposit for this item because it's not just uh oh i hope this doesn't end up you know polluting on the side of the road somewhere it's this is an actual useful item um yeah and there's a lot of value in it because you can bring it back and and have it be completely reused so what was the impetus for this company then you know when we were doing the worm poop thing we asked ourselves are we fulfilling our mission to eliminate the idea of waste that's how it always began it wasn't my aspiration wasn't to create a fertilizer company it was create a waste solutions company and we realized no because we're not making you know the the garbage the hero and that's how we did that first shift we asked ourselves you know uh maybe now five years ago is recycling the answer to garbage because that's what we were doing and are still doing in a very big way and we realized you know it's not it's a solution to the symptom of garbage but not to the root cause if we don't have garbage we don't really need recycling right and so then the question became what is the root cause of garbage and i would argue garbage was invented in the 1950s uh when uh disposable consumption became big i mean before that we cobbled our shoes we mended our clothes we bought milk from the milkman you know and motor oil perfume came in reusable packaging it was a very different world and it's this idea i think of throwaway society is what created the modern idea of waste and then all the data that backs that up on when garbage just exploded and so then the question was okay how do we shift from a single use ecosystem to a reusable but but in a way that's going to appeal to everyone not just the super hardcore you know consumers who are probably already going to package free stores and doing the sort of thing how do we get the walmart chopper right uh who buys tropicana orange juice and coke and whatever and what we realized is that reuse already exists in a big way in the united states propane tanks super reusable beer kegs super reusable and it's not even appealing to eco people it's just how those products are but try to take your propane tank to the beer store or take the beer keg to wherever you got the propane tank and it doesn't work and that's just two products and so the basic idea was if we're gonna really scale reuse we have to solve that right we have to make it that you can buy something anywhere and return it anywhere sort of your recycling bin right your recycling bin doesn't care where you bought that soda bottle it just cares that it is a soda bomb and so once we had that that was sort of the essence of what we wanted to create is this is this overall platform and what got brands really excited about it was it's it's it's sort of you know both against the uh you know solving for the risk but all but much more about innovation because if you're a brand today what's happening your budget for packaging is decreasing every year because you're trying to squeeze cost squeeze cost squeeze costs have you noticed how packaging is always getting sort of thinner and i noticed this by the way on a monopoly board right it's one of my favorite games and um but if you compare monopoly boards that are made today compared to 50 years ago have you noticed the pieces are just thinner you know not solid it's just made you know uh with with with lower value materials and that's the same and i mean absolutely everything and that's a problem because you can't innovate you can't really do cool things whenever year your budget goes down but if you shift the package to the point you had mentioned earlier from being something that the consumer owns to something they borrow then you can explode the investment in the package because it's now an asset and that is what got everyone really excited about loop is not just that it's more sustainable i mean absolutely but they can now do things that they could never do before because they keep getting that package back and so to your point the deposit is not in bottle bills which are good things the deposit is a motivator to have you recycle more that's its entire function to get you to collect more and bottle bills do increase recycling rates but in luke the deposit is actually what the package is worth right now you can keep it it's no problem but that's what it's worth to the company who you know who wants it back so they don't have to make it again they can just clean it and fill it up and that was the huge breakthrough which is why we've seen it you know it moves so quickly overall it's really interesting i i studied as a plastics engineer i haven't applied it much thankfully um but one i remember one of the lessons was okay so we've learned how to make a bottle out of plastic now how do we make it attractive to consumers and it's so what you need is you want something that's ideally cold and also shiny because that's what humans they cold shiny things um wonder why uh you know metals and stuff that good to have around rocks uh maybe shiny rocks preferably um but the problem was how do you make plastic which is insulative so when you touch it it's warm and it's naturally not that shiny you have to plate it with metal you have to do with something to make the person want to buy it so you add some kind of reflective stuff but what you're actually able to do is package these items in glass and stainless steel both of which are cold to the touch and shiny and i think that's a really interesting point because when you're trying to reduce costs i mean obviously you know you wonder why the tequila is in such a fancy bottle it's because you're not paying actually that much for the tequila you're paying partially for the bottle they needed to grab you in the store and well you know that it's a high margin item so i mean i assume brands just love being able to pour money into packaging but does it have to be standardized between all these brands the way we sort of answered this right because there's this natural tension the more standardized the lower the cost is right it's we can get bigger cleaning equipment that cleans that package a greater scale lowering the cost and the less standardized or the exact opposite but what we've determined here is luke doesn't have an opinion on standardization we let the companies decide just frankly today disposable packaging has the same thing have you noticed the aisle of cereal everything is a box in a bag and the only difference between cheerios and whatever else is the artwork but then you go over to the perfume aisle and every perfume object is wildly different so let the market decide i mean you know the the market knows what consumers want and where differentiation is important and where it's absolutely not important have you noticed motor oil containers all look the same right because clearly probably it doesn't matter to whoever buys motor oil but in cosmetics it really matters so we we let the markets decide and if a company is really asking us how do we make the cost lower what we're going to recommend be standardized but if they want to innovate and go into really amazing places then you do anything you want but the cost of cleaning that object will go up because the apples to apples comparison between say a shampoo bottle you know that's in plastic single use and well here's one this is say a shampoo ball this is pantene in lube which is reusable is in this in the plastic version whatever the cost of that plastic bottle is a hundred percent in the price of your shampoo you own it ironic because of course you don't want it in this one what goes into the price of the shampoo when they calculate it is your use of this bottle and the cost of cleaning it right and that's your apples to apples uh you know uh one-to-one comparison and it's amazing to see these different industries go you know really in different directions um i'll give you a fun one though we're actually launching beer in the uk in luke with this really cool company called brewdog and they're going to put into a growler and um we were running the econ it's a stainless steel gorgeous beautiful growler and it turns out if uh it's cheaper to buy it's going to be cheaper to buy with them a whatever it is a gallon of beer good premium beer in a stainless steel growler it's going to be way cheaper to buy that even if you keep the growler than buying the growler empty on amazon by 50 is that wild wow i want to ask you about the cost of cleaning because um you know when we were using this it really is cool to have your pantry full of stainless steel you know a thing of rice and stainless steel it was just never seen that before that that's awesome because normally it's in some bag that's falling over or whatever so that was awesome but then i did think about okay well this has to go back to some kind of cleaning plant and how you know is that a huge cost or is that because it's you know so many of these coming back to a big plant that's done efficiently is it not a big cost yes right so what i mean by that is in the short term right now while loop is still relative to single use packaging tiny right really even though we're working with all these big companies the relative volume is still small it is expensive now who's funding it is not the consumer it's the brands you know it's the retailer and it's us i mean we're not making money we're investing quite a bit into it and i could say the same for all these brands and retailers but at scale it does become very competitive with uh single-use packaging and it just requires it to get to that scale which is what we're really focused on right now how do we make the volume of it be as big as possible and you can look at models around the world where it already does exist at scale and functions very well the entire beer industry in canada is on returnable bottles the entire beverage industry in germany is returnable uh bottles and so if it can work there it just it's very easy to extrapolate that it can work for you know your pasta sauce to your you know your rice you name it it we just got to get to that really big scale so the name of the game on loop is as quickly as possible trying to get the scale of it to go big which is why we're partnered with mcdonald's and burger king and all these places in an effort to try to get the volumes to be as high as possible so what's the end game i mean what is going to the grocery store look in this i let's just call it a perfect world um where everything i buy is in a reusable container so i mean is it i go to the store one day and i have to buy a bunch of stuff and i have a deposit bill that's 50 or is it just i've been living my whole life doing this so it's not that bad because i've just you know brought back all of my stuff that i'm going to be buying but full now yeah it's it's it's exactly that right so the end state is that any retailer you walk into i mean honestly whether it's a bowling alley or a movie theater all the way to your grocery store or your auto shop you would be able to you know buy whatever products you want now in in in a reusable context right so in consumables that's you know take uh a you know bottle of orange juice you pay a deposit and then you pay for the juice and then you can take that and drop it off in any other retailer so it's really literally a throwaway experience and then you get your deposit back and you know the more you do you would have a bigger let's call it deposit float but you do that once and it just sort of rotates right because you're you know you return something you get money back you buy something it moves it up and you have this sort of float of deposit overall which shouldn't at all in the end really increase your costs right um in what's really interesting in loop as well because we talked a lot about it in what we would call consumables stuff in a bottle where you consume it and you return to us an empty bottle we're also in a few months launching reusable diapers in luke with a big diaper brand here in the us or baby clothing in the uk now we talked about clothing and the whole fast fashion problem and what's interesting and let's call it a durable right not a consumable but a durable the way it works in say baby clothing is um you when you buy it you pay a cost to use it let's just say that's five bucks and a deposit to own it and let's call that ten bucks just you know made up numbers so you pay 15. but then when you're done whatever you know your baby grew out of it or you know uh maybe you gave it to someone else and then their baby grew out of it there's no time limit whenever you return it you get your deposit back 10 bucks and then instead of having to make a new garment we just uh repair it clean it and sell it again to someone else and that so this can be applied to you know any product where we use is an opportunity right and those are products that become waste baby clothing is a good one because babies go out of their clothing incredibly fast um where there's an opportunity to improve design because you're moving from a a disposable ecosystem to an asset so you can really increase design and what you're trying to solve for waste right so it's not for everything it wouldn't be for swiss watches right there's no no benefit of reuse there unless you wanted to rotate through styles you know really quickly perhaps um but it does work as well in these other constructs and that's the end point now at the beginning it's sort of the idea of organic but instead of picking the fight on you know let's call it farming practices we're picking it on reuse so in the stores it's already physically in it's a section of the store you walk in and it's all the loop reusable products are stacked together and you can then you know buy your what all these different things your spreads and your crackers and your rice and whatever in a section of the store and if consumers then vote for it it'll get bigger and bigger now we're going to cut it here for this episode of in depth but the full interview with another 30 minutes of riveting and fascinating conversation with tom is on our disruptive investing so you can use the link down below to pick up where you left off over on that full interview we didn't cut anywhere else so you're basically starting halfway through the episode also if you just over there by yourself on the disruptive investing we'll put a timestamp where you can start exactly where you left off here so you're not wasting any time now if you haven't heard about our disruptive investing before we have dozens of videos with some of the smartest most disruptive minds in the world donald sataway from ambry george hotz from comma ai and rebecca dibb simkin from octopus energy just to name a few on disruptive investing you can get a deep dive with people on topics that are mind-melting you can see the world in new ways disruptive ways and we all know that when you disrupt an industry you potentially can make a lot of money so go check it out thank you so much to tom zaki for joining us and doing the amazing work that he's doing to make the planet a better place and thank you for

all right so let's start talking about this let's start at the beginning and we'll see how much we can stomach yeah we're going to debunk it point by point i mean there's quotes in here the ev industry is powered by greed lies and deception or blood is on its hands knowingly supports environmental destruction as well as child labor and economic slavery so let's just jump into it and let's go through the first argument general motors is heavily promoting the new hummer as a zero emission car but the claim isn't just in just that lie there may be no exhaust coming from the back of new hammer but the electricity that drives it definitely creates pollution as most of the energy generated in the us still comes from burning fossil fuel all right it's true that most of the energy generated in the u.s still comes from burning fossil fuels but it's quickly getting greener every month the iea just reported that for the first six months of 2022 25 of electrical generation in the united states came from renewables and this is going to increase fast as more solar and wind farms replace fossil fuel burning power plants because there's one piece of the equation that fossil fuels will never be able to beat the sun shines and the wind blows for free every day and solar and wind is some of the cheapest installed generation that you can possibly produce so is she right no let's be honest she's giving you a false argument the tailpipe of even one of the most inefficient evs the gmc ev hummer is not putting out any pollution of any kind because there is no tailpipe and the emissions made to make that electricity depend on where you get your electricity if you plug your evn at home and you have solar panels then your ev is 100 clean no matter how you cut it if on the other hand you plug your ev into the grid in let's say the worst grid in america wyoming's you're getting your electricity from burning 72.8 percent coal and that's pretty bad and so a lot of these evs are bad arguments cherry pick states this one to make the argument that see you're just driving a coal powered machine but hang on what's the alternative in wyoming an internal combustion engine vehicle one that burns gasoline or diesel fuel is that any cleaner even in the worst case scenarios wyoming or poland which she uses in her they also get most of their electricity from burning coal it's still 28 percent cleaner to drive an ev than to drive a gas burning car but hang on her argument gets worse because most people don't live in wyoming or paul poland let's take the very populous state of california here's where the electricity came from on an average day in california on wednesday january 26 2022. okay 55 percent from renewables 19.5 percent for natural gas and only 0.1 percent from coal basically an average day in california way cleaner electricity than wyoming or poland's and now how does an ev fare that studies show that under these grid conditions evs produce 70 to 80 percent less co2 than gas or diesel so while her statement is correct for now that most electricity in the us is currently derived from burning fossil fuels it is a misdirect it is misleading you to believe that driving an ev is no better than driving a gas burning car and that is absolutely false it ignores so many other factors that they don't want to bring into the discussion for instance how about the other stuff that comes out of the tailpipe of a gas burning car besides co2 how about the nitrogen oxides yeah elevated levels of nitrogen dioxide can cause damage to the human respiratory tract and increase a person's vulnerability to and the severity of respiratory infections in asthma long-term exposure to high levels of nitrogen dioxide can cause chronic lung disease that doesn't come out of the back of an ev but you know what in the u.s gas burning vehicles produced over 4 million tons of nitrogen dioxide in 2021 and you know what else doesn't come out of the back of an ev this oh you can't see it well look closer uh no even even closer yeah it's called pm 2.5 it it's super small it's a particle that's 2.5 micrometers in diameter it's 1 25th the diameter of a human hair so you're not going to see it but guess what lots of these pm 2.5 particles come out of the back of gas burning cars well that's okay because i can't see them so how bad can they be real bad these particles are so small that your body can't filter them out you can with bigger dust particles they get into your lungs and then into your brain pm 2.5 has been linked to lung cancer asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and premature death and according to the who pm 2.5 is associated with the greatest proportion of adverse health effects related to air pollution both in the united states and worldwide and i know what you're thinking i don't know what that means i mean it's spread out all over the country so it's probably not that bad yeah it's that bad in 2018 according to the epa 125 million people in the u.s lived in areas where on average air pollution was a above healthy levels yep over a third of our population breathes polluted air southern forney smog levels were above federal standards for almost three months in a row that year and if you're well that's okay i don't live in southern california hang on nearly half of the states had at least one county with unhealthy air in 2018. again her whole is based on cherry-picked misleading arguments that are designed to confuse and cause fear step back and look at the bigger picture and her whole thesis falls apart and she even has to admit this but only after she planted the fear and before she goes on to some of the other ridiculous claims basically sandwiching the truth in between a bunch of lies her next piece of lye bread is electric cars are very energy intensive to build mostly due to the resources needed to produce their battery packs because of this electric cars are much more damaging to produce than the gas powered ancestors on average an electric car needs to be driven around 60 000 kilometers before its lifetime emissions make it cleaner than a car that runs on fossil fuels hang on she even admits that this factoid is questionable from the get-go look at her entire quote depending on which study you consult yeah this is a quote from an opinion piece not a scientific journal and it's true there are many studies out some of which are funded by the fossil fuel industry bent on getting one result but let's cite a scientific study how about this one from michael wang a senior scientist and director of the systems assessment center at argonne's energy systems division it shows that evs on almost any grid besides 100 coal produce less co2 within a year even on a hundred percent coal power grids a tesla model 3 is the winner in just over five years one study not enough for you how about this one then from the icct or the international council on clean transportation that concluded that results show that even for cars registered today battery electric vehicles have by far the lowest life cycle greenhouse gas emissions their numbers show that a medium-sized ev has lower climate impact in europe 66 to 6 69 reduction the u.s a 60 to 68 reduction china 37 to 45 reduction in india a 19 to 34 reduction in the us today electric vehicles emit about a third of the lifetime emissions of their internal combustion brethren according to their report oh you'd to see another report okay how about this one conducted by the city of vancouver canada which conducted an lca study in 2018 comparing a ford focus and a mitsubishi imev for a 93 000 mile lifespan and concluded that the gas-powered ford produced 392 grams of co2 equivalent per kilometer versus the mitsubishi which produced just 203 grams per kilometer equivalent not good enough you want another sure how about the 2019 study by italian scientists published in modern environmental science and engineering which stated the analysis shows that electric vehicles perform better than traditional ones in terms of greenhouse gas emissions depletion of non-renewable resources and emissions of atmospheric pollutants affecting urban areas on average they found the reduction of co2 by evs was about 50 percent you need more studies yep you got it how about the european-based 2020 transport and environment study using an lca analysis which stated the potential of electric cars to mitigate co2 emissions is crystal clear on average evs are close to three times cleaner than diesel and petrol gas cars today discussing whether or not coal fueled electric cars are better or worse for the climate than conventional cars is no longer relevant evs are 30 percent cleaner even then even the united states government states that this whole thing is a myth well if there's so many studies proving your points i can jesse then where did she get her studies from let's be honest she probably had a hard time finding reputable studies that she could cite so she had to use an opinion piece that also didn't cite a source but let's do her work for her yeah let's find a study that does prove her point how about this one from the german ifo institute that says that electric vehicles will barely help cut co2 emissions in germany over the coming years it suggests that in germany the co2 emissions of battery electric vehicles are in the best case slightly higher than those of a diesel engine the mass press picked up on this back in 2019 when it came out and ran with it but you know what as new data came out their study became irrelevant but of course the headlines remained what's worse is when studies are funded by the oil industry and designed to mislead as cnbc and the guardian reported back in 2018 oil industry is peddling misinformation about electric vehicles and that's the problem the press reports on studies and reports but many of them are bought and paid for by big oil sorel goes on to make this claim and is also the problem of waste these cars produce whereas almost every part of a gas powered car can be scrapped over recycled this isn't the case with electric car battery packs which are not designed to be reused and according to most manufacturers need to be replaced every 100 000 miles but her claim ignores one important point maybe you can recycle an old gas car but how about the on average 5600 gallons of gasoline that got burned by that car during its lifetime can you recycle that oh no oh right because it was burned and all that co2 and air pollution remember the nitrous dioxide and the pm 2.5 particles yeah that well that's all floating around heating up the atmosphere and polluting our lungs yeah 69 million metric tons of co2 produced in an average ice car's lifespan can you recycle that and how about the 63 pounds of nitrous dioxide produced and the 600 grams of pm 2.5 that's created over the lifespan of an average ice car now you might be saying 600 grams that's nothing that's only 1.3 pounds but that's an enough pm 2.5 to prematurely kill 35 people so she says that you can recycle the ice car but she conveniently ignored all of the effects of the ice car and the stuff that it burned how convenient but you know what battery packs can be recycled sorel makes it sound ev battery packs have to be thrown out but her own footage reveals the truth yeah every single picture and that she uses to talk about battery waste actually comes from battery recyclers because it makes sense materials inside an ev battery the lithium graphite copper nickel aluminum so forth are all really valuable and so nobody wants to throw them away and that is why there's a bunch of new companies redwood materials life cycle and ascend elements which by the way we went and visited that are busy recycling batteries as we speak so no her argument is false on its face and one more thing she claimed that the average lifespan of an ev battery pack was only a hundred thousand miles this is false it's false it's a total fabrication i have two evs right outside with almost a hundred thousand miles on them and their battery packs are doing great test loop and eevee ride share has evs in its fleet with 300 and 400 000 miles and these are early generation battery packs as battery technology improves ranges are going to get even higher evs haven't even been around long enough to get an accurate battery pack lifespan estimate but it's easy to make the argument now well these batteries aren't being recycled because they're still in [ __ ] use so get your facts straight before making misleading claims her last argument is all about cobalt and how bad it is she talks about the dangers of artisanal cobalt mines in the congo and how children are forced to work as minors this is a great argument for her because she can keep showing little children in africa and it's hard not to feel an emotional response and what she failed to mention is that there's lots of sources of cobalt in the world that don't involve children the sherret nickel and cobalt mine in fort saskatchewan alberta or the talva vara mine in finland and now there are a lot of environmentally conscious minds coming online in the developed world because of the increased value of cobalt because of electric cars and don't get us wrong we don't want little children or mistreated people mining for materials but there are three points that she didn't bring up number one you don't need cobalt in an ev battery yeah tesla for instance is making cars right now hundreds of thousands of them that have no cobalt at all in the battery that's right they're called lfp or lithium iron phosphate and they work just fine without any cobalt in fact many manufacturers are making their cars with ease number two ice cars use something called gasoline to run them and she didn't show us any of this yeah somehow she didn't include any of this footage of oil spills train tank or derailments pipeline bursts wildlife soaked in oil or the ocean on fire yeah i guess that didn't play into her argument but guess what it has way more effect on you and the planet than a mineral it makes up less than three percent of a lithium nickel manganese cobalt battery cell and la and lastly as we mentioned ev batteries are recyclable and one of the most valuable materials to be recycled is the cobalt so as we go forward less and less cobalt will be mined and more and more will be sourced from recycled batteries today if cobalt is something that you don't want in your ev you have many choices of evs that have no cobalt did she mention that in her the tesla model y standard range being sold in europe right now is made with byd lfp batteries no cobalt the tesla model 3 is made in shanghai have lfp batteries no cobalt again this is all designed to misdirect mislead and cause fud as long as you have fear about evs it will delay you from learning more and getting one and that's what the fossil fuel industry wants was her full of facts or misleading information you be the judge and sorel even admits but do i think that electric cars are the solution that a world needs right now personally i just don't know so then why the [ __ ] did you put out a making false claims and then not even come to a helpful conclusion you just miss late led people and confused them and told them to take less airplane flights and walk more we all know that walking and riding bikes is better than driving but most people won't replace their cars with a bike or walking shoes and for those people you just delayed the transition to sustainable transportation and for that i can't forgive you you have a subscriber base more than twice the size of ours and with that comes responsibility in my opinion you just took a bunch of oil industry talking points at face value added a bunch of shiny b-roll and regurgitated it out to your audience all to come to the conclusion that you don't even have an answer i just don't know well we have an answer and we talk about it every week on our shows as we have for the past six years we've done the research we do the interviews we know the facts evs are the answer clean energy is here and it's growing and we encourage you to be part of the solution not the problem if you follow sorel's convoluted you're likely to be paralyzed with indecision and doubt and the world doesn't need any more of that thank you for watching and being a part of our amazing community i'm sorry if we got a little riled up there but this kind of fud really gets me mad if you've got someone who keeps sharing this kind of fun with you about evs then share this back to them let us show them that their arguments make no sense and if you

any good points that we didn't address here in this and before we go this episode was sponsored by our friends at henson shaving we can't do the work we do without the support of you our viewers and patrons and our generous sponsors we've been working with henson because we believe in their sustainable mission now you might be saying how is a shaver sustainable but that's because the way most of us do shaving isn't sustainable yeah we buy shavers that use disposable shaver heads not only are they expensive but they're super impossible to recycle well henson and does it differently they made this precisely manufactured aluminum or titanium shaver that holds this recyclable steel blade perfectly meaning not to get a perfect clean shave every time but you don't need to waste money on a disposable cartridge which by the way multiple blade cartridges actually pull the hair up out of your face and then cut it so that it pops back under the surface of your skin which leaves you with a nice smooth face for a day until those hairs start to grow and many of them become ingrown which leaves bumps in painful irritation fix that problem save money be sustainable by going to

your tickets at evie raffle.org your odds may never be better zack and i have been reporting on evs for years and because of our awesome community of patrons and viewers we get to see pretty much everything that's going on in the eevee world yeah the good the bad and the ugly we see it all because you share it all with us and we wouldn't want it any other way but it does mean that we see our fair share of this yeah this is an email many others before it that has been making its way around the interwebs many of you have shared it with us and it's very similar to many other emails that have been circulating for years and the gist of it is that evs are bad don't be fooled and you know what many of you have asked us to debunk these emails so today we are but first unfortunately if you're going to debunk something you have to read it so here goes and remember this isn't us saying it this is just some here we go as an engineer i love electric vehicle technology however i have been troubled by the fact that the electrical energy to keep the batteries charged has to come from the grid and that means more power generation and a huge increase in the distribution infrastructure whether generated from coal gas oil wind or sun install generation capacity is limited if electric cars do not use gasoline they will not be paying a gasoline tax on every gallon sold for automobiles which was enacted to maintain our roads and bridges they will use the roads but they will not pay for their maintenance okay i just want to stop there this is how it was formatted we're just reading okay back back to it back to it in case you were thinking of buying hybrid or an electric car ever since the advent of electric cars the real cost per mile of those things has never been discussed all you ever heard was that the mile per gallon in terms of gasoline with nary a mention of the cost of electricity to run it electricity has to be one of the least efficient ways to power things yet they're being shoved down our throats glad somebody finally put engineering and math to paper if you really intend to adopt electric vehicles you will face certain realities for example a home charging system for a tesla requires 75 amp service the average house is equipped with 100 amp service on a small street approximately 25 homes the electrical infrastructure would be unable to carry more than three houses with a single tesla each for even half the homes to have electric vehicles the system would be wildly overloaded this is the elephant in the room with electric vehicles our residential infrastructure cannot bear the load and by the way i'm throwing up in my mouth as i read this if you want to argue with the green person over cars that are eco-friendly just read the following note if you are a green person read it anyway it's enlightening eric test drove the chevy volt at the invitation of general motors and he writes for four days in a row the fully charged battery lasted only 25 miles before the volt switched to the reserve gasoline engine eric calculated the car got 30 miles per gallon including the 25 miles it ran on the battery so the range including the 9 gallon gas tank and the 16 kilowatt hour battery is approximately 270 miles it will take you 4.5 hours to drive 270 miles at 60 miles an hour then add 10 hours to charge the battery and you have a total trip time of 14.5 hours in a typical road trip your average speed including charge time would be 20 miles per hour according to general motors the volt battery holds 16 kilowatt hours of energy it takes a full 10 hours to charge a drained battery the cost for the electricity to charge the vault is never mentioned so i looked up what i paid for electricity i pay approximately it varies with the amount used in the seasons a dollar 16 per kilowatt hour 16 kilowatt hours times a dollar 16 per kilowatt hour equals 18.56 to charge the battery per charge divided by 25 miles equals 74 cents per mile to operate the vault using the battery compare this to a similar size car with a gasoline engine that gets only 32 miles per gallon 3.19 per gallon divided by 32 miles per gallon equals 10 cents per mile the gasoline-powered car costs about 25 thousand dollars while the vault costs 46 000 plus so the canadian government wants loyal canadians not to do the math but simply pay twice as much for a car that cost more than seven times as much to run and takes three times longer to drive across the country wake up north america okay this has to be some of the weakest arguments i've ever heard okay so i'm just gonna start here let's start with one of one of the earlier things that this person says okay electricity has to be one of the least efficient ways to power things yet they're being shoved on our throats so this is easily verifiably false almost any way you slice it my model 3 uses roughly 250 watt hours per mile a single gallon of gasoline has 36 kilowatt hours of energy so that's 36 000 watt hours of electricity in one gallon of gas and even a super efficient gas car at 36 miles a gallon would be using about one mile per kilowatt hour or a thousand watt hours per mile which is four times as much energy to go the same distance as the tesla which by the way also ignores all the energy needed to refine the gasoline in the first place but we'll get into that in a minute so a great first unsubstantiated claim here by our author next up for example a home charging system for a tesla requires 75 amps service absolute okay i charge my car off a regular wall outlet it draws 15 amps off a 110 volt circuit maximum that is 1.5 kilowatts you can upgrade the charger to a 20 or 30 amp 220 volt service that is going to be your typical level 2 charger that is a 6.6 kilowatt circuit if you want that and that would charge most vehicles overnight no problem a 75 amp circuit is complete overkill it was only possible with the very first model s's i think tesla didn't even know they're well some people might want to charge in two hours you do not need that it's stupid and that's why tesla has done away with on-board chargers that can even handle that kind of juice because of course no one's gonna devote a 75 amp circuit in their house to power their car the letter goes on to only talk about the chevy volt which is not a great example of an ev since it's a plug-in hybrid with a relatively tiny battery but i want to even go beyond this because let me defend the volt here for a minute many of the numbers that they're using in regards to it are very dubious it sounds it was written seven to ten years ago yeah and all the facts are wrong about how long it takes to charge and they're saying oh on a road trip you'd have to spend 10 hours to charge no that's the beauty of the vault is you would just fill it up with gasoline so uh no and then you know it would take three times as long to take a road trip that's not true of any vehicle that we're talking about also their price of electricity in the letter is unheard of they claim a dollar sixteen per kilowatt hour which is astronomical yeah we pay around 22 cents per kilowatt hour here in massachusetts and that is very high to the rest of the united states the average in the u.s is 16 cents per kilowatt hour that's a dollar less than what this bozo is saying maybe they're cherry-picking hawaiian energy rates no i checked rates in hawaii average around 38 cents per kilowatt hour so i mean the only halfway decent argument in this whole letter in my opinion is that evs don't pay gas taxes but the letter doesn't mention how gas taxes aren't put directly towards our bridges and roads anyway nor do they mention that the gas tax hasn't been raised since 1993 not even to match inflation meaning that my whole lifetime as inflation and as gas prices have been going up gas taxes have becoming a smaller and smaller percentage of the price of gas and becoming a smaller and more meaningless portion of tax revenue also they forgot to mention that many states have already put in place ev registration taxes to make up for the lack of gas taxes so this concern has already been addressed but i want to get back to a point that i think gets completely missed by people because they don't understand how gasoline gets made yeah if you're going to say that evs are bad you have to also look at ice or internal combustion engine vehicles and talk about what powers them gasoline to make gasoline you need to drill oil out of the ground you need to move it by pipeline or tanker to a refinery and there you have to refine it and how do you refine gasoline you might ask you have to superheat oil and process it which takes energy a lot of energy in fact according to the department of energy refiners used 47 terawatt hours of electricity to produce gasoline from 5.3 billion barrels of oil so yes evs use electricity but weirdly enough so do ice cars it takes 11 percent of our energy needs just to discover mine refine and transport fossil fuels and it doesn't just take electricity to refine oil into gasoline that's right they actually have to burn oil and natural gas to heat up the oil to refine it into gasoline it's crazy right you have to burn fossil fuels to make the fossil fuels that you then will burn in your car when people talk about tail pipe emissions for gas cars they never address the emissions created by refining the fuels they somehow get to ignore that and instead make the argument against evs only right they get to say hey well you know just cause an eevee doesn't have uh tailpipe emissions that doesn't mean that it doesn't emit in you or to use this energy and then they get and they say well a gas car burns this they never happen to mention what happens at the refinery where electricity is used and also oil and gas are burned in order to heat up the oil to refine it the fossil fuel industry makes so much money in the u.s last year just four companies had a profit of 75 billion dollars profit and they don't just make that money by being good capitalists they get government subsidies in 2020 the fossil fuel industry globally received 5.9 trillion dollars in government handouts they only need to use a small portion of this money to control the narrative the same narrative that is in that letter we just read that eevees are bad now does this mean that the person who sent that email works for an oil company probably not no but the arguments that they are passing along definitely came from oil companies these letters are always full of so much unsubstantiated crap and they are so misleading and full of fud fear uncertainty and doubt and that is their only purpose to get you worried about our clean sustainable electric future because when you're worried you'll be paralyzed with fear and that's where they want you every day that they can keep you from trying an ev is another day of profits for them so the next time you get one of these emails or see this argument on your social media feed don't pass it along instead send them this so that we can help educate people about the truth now you know thanks so much for

Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJl35aIy5pOVBHvoGgqavrdJ,LbAMB1h_ins,in august 2021 at tesla's ai day i think it's fair to say that the world was surprised to see that in addition to telling us all about full self-driving hardware and software tesla revealed that they were working on this tesla bot or optimus a humanoid autonomous robot much of the press played up the dancing robot and made it seem a joke but mark my words this is no joke elon brought up optimus during the cyber rodeo giga texas festivities in early april saying i think optimus will obviate when an economy even means anything that humans don't want to do optimus will do it it's going to be an age of abundance it may be hard to imagine but as you see optimus develop it's really going to transform the world to a degree even greater than the cars then during the q1 2022 earnings call elon said this i was surprised that people did not realize the magnitude of the optimus robot program the importance of optimus will become apparent in the coming years those who are insightful or listen carefully will understand that optimus ultimately will be worth more than the car business worth more than full self-driving that's my firm belief do we have your attention this is no joke let's get into tesla bot and how and why this new technology is going to change life as we know it before we know it i'm zach and i'm jesse and

your chance to win a tesla model s plaid right now now we've had robots for decades so why is tesla bot going to be any different from these robots that we know these robots have very limited jobs the roomba can indeed move around your house and vacuum but it can only do that one task you still need to set it up empty it when it gets full of dirt it can't move upstairs or out to the garage by itself this the now ubiquitous robot arm is mounted bolted to the factory floor it has a team of humans who program it to do one task as efficiently as possible for every task you need to install another robot arm and program it and then update it when the task changes tesla bot is different it will use a similar suite of sensors hardware and software that your tesla with full self-driving uses cameras will see the world around it and it will use ai the cars do to interpret what's around it where to go and how to do it at once it will use motors instead of muscles to do what humans would do manipulate its environment because tesla bot can do what you can do see think and understand its world it doesn't need fancy programming to tell it what you want it to do just you don't need to tell your friend how to go to the store and pick you up a sandwich first tighten your right leg muscle move your body forward then you get to a door look for a doorknob grab it with your hand then turn it and open the door you never have to sail that all you need to say is i'd a sandwich with extra mayo your friend has the experience to know how to find a sandwich shop get there buy you the sandwich you asked for and return back to you with it how does your friend know how to do all this two eyes a powerful processor and experience with the world to know how it works what tesla is now learning from moving cars around in the world autonomously can be directly applied to tesla bots humanoid robots that move bipedally instead of with four wheels but basically the same problems how do you teach a computer to see and understand its environment and move around safely within it this actually helps answer or the next question why will tesla be able to accomplish a humanoid autonomous robot before anyone else i mean we all have seen boston dynamics by now working on robots i mean theirs can really dance and theirs can pick up packages the answer is that boston dynamics has done some amazing work and yes some of the robots can see and move around their environment but to truly be autonomous you have to solve for edge cases let's go back to the example of sending your friend to get you a sandwich if something unexpected happens during your friend's mission to get you a sandwich let's say a garbage truck blocks his path or the sandwich shop is closed or they're out of rye bread what will your friend do will they just get stuck and never deliver your sandwich probably not most of us are pretty good at adapting to unexpected situations we have learned how to go around a truck or find another route or find a different sandwich shop or to text you and ask what other bread you'd prefer this kind of learning takes tons of data i mean just think about how you learn to solve all of the problems you encounter every day you learn and it takes humans years and years to learn tesla bot is going to learn tesla cars do by moving around in its environment and sharing that data with tesla so that all tesla bots can learn from one irobot the maker of the roomba vacuum robot says that they have sold over 35 million roombas so far but the problem is the roombas don't talk to one another they don't learn they come to your house pre-programmed to do a very simple task they're designed with clever programming but not actual smarts themselves tesla currently has about 3 million cars on the road with autonomy hardware even when you are driving the car teslas can be in shadow mode watching the road and simulating what they would have done at that red light at that turn during that lane change that you made they are uploading that data back to tesla for training and then get updates every couple weeks so that the entire fleet of robot cars are learning and getting smarter jesse and i have two teslas on the full self-driving beta program and we actually have experienced the cars getting better at autonomous driving but tesla bots aren't cars even though they're basically the same inside a powerful ai computer sensors and autonomy software tesla bots are not designed to get you from point a to point b a tesla car is tesla bots are designed for a different purpose tesla bots are designed to replace human labor [music] take a look at human labor you could argue that another word for human labor is our economy pretty much everything that brings value to our society is brought about at least in part due to human labor a human doing work is involved in almost every step now as humans have invented new technologies plows and then tractors we have multiplied the amount of work a human can do in a day by many fold but don't be fooled humans were still heavily involved in making and programming these new tools one way we use to measure labor or economy is gdp gross domestic product the total monetary value of all the finished goods and services produced in a certain place and again who produces these goods and services we humans do so what is the gdp of earth as of 2020 it was calculated to be about 85 trillion dollars wow look at that graph now why has gdp taken off so quickly from just 500 million dollars in 1960. well think about what's happened since 1960 farms look this in 1960. today farms look this factories in 1960 look this factories today look this you get the picture robots computers the internet and modern machines give each human a huge production multiplier as each human can make more stuff or provide more services in a day the economy grows now let's look at tesla bot which is in essence a human analog a human replacement a machine that will be able to do many of the tasks that a human can do and here's the thing tesla bot will be able to do these tasks without training and that brings us to a couple huge advantages the tesla bots are going to have over humans so when you want to hire a new employee what's the first thing that you have to do run a job listing yep then what review resumes interviews selection committee offer letter employment contract the new employee has to relocate give notice to their last employer etc right it's a whole process time consuming expensive paperwork it's why companies have hr departments right with tesla bot here's what hiring looks tesla bot get to work yes sir tesla bot reporting to work according to a study by glassdoor it costs on average four thousand dollars to hire the average employee and to go through the steps that we just talked about according to zippya the average cost is even higher at 4 425 according to linkedin and shrm it takes 30 to 36 days to hire the average employee according to zippya it takes 36 to 42 days to fill the average position again with tesla bot the hiring cost is zero and the average time is only as long as it takes to open the shipping box or maybe it will remove itself from the shipping box now let's talk about the next thing you have to do after you hire a new employee you know employee badges employee handbook weeks of on-the-job training somebody else has got to do it exactly in 2020 across all industries according to indeed companies spent an average of 1252 dollars per employee on training and how much time does it take well according to bamboo hr employ employers should plan to spend at least three months to fully onboard a new employee and remember that during this training and onboarding process a company has to expend human resources to oversee the training to ensure that the new employee is learning the job correctly that's another cost that's hard to account for but is certainly not efficient and no matter how good you are at hiring training and onboarding it isn't always a good fit and you may have to go through all that work and time and money as a company and then have an employee decide bye this wasn't the right job for me all that time and money down the toilet back to the job listings to start all over again this can really slow a company down expanding into a new market with a sales team or working on a new product line yeah it's a huge problem finding good people that fit the company culture but let's say you do find the right person it's a good fit you got through the hiring process the training process and now it's their first full day on the job in this case the job is in an auto factory on the line installing wire harnesses okay here's the job you grab this wiring harness and 14 of these clips from this bin over here and you move over to that car as it goes by on the line and you lean into the trunk area here and you attach the harness to these 14 points here with the plastic clips and you have about 60 seconds before the next car is at your station what do i have to do that over and over again all day well not all day i mean you have a couple 15 minute breaks and a 45 minute lunch break but yeah i mean we got to get these cars out the door to customers that's why we hired you but i mean twisting my body that all day and twisting my wrists and pushing these hard plastic clips into these holes all day my fingers and wrists are in my back i mean i can already feel the pain well yeah these are repetitive tasks but how else do you think we're gonna get this job done don't worry you'll build up your muscles and some calluses and we have these nice gloves and work belt for you see this is where tesla bot shines tesla bot can do repetitive tasks all day long and i mean all day 24 hours without breaks humans get hurt by doing repetitive tasks robots do not humans get bored by repetitive tasks robots do not if a human does get hurt on the job it's a big deal for the employee and the company that employee will need short and long-term medical attention that human will be in pain it will affect their livelihood and their quality of life if a robot wears out a part a bearing it just needs to get replaced and the robot is back up and running new no physical therapy no special protective gear no prescription medicines and let's just talk about injuries to workers for a second because let's face it many jobs are dangerous either from injuries due to repetitive tasks or because employees are working around powerful machines and tools according to the bureau of labor statistics 2.8 million american employees were injured on the job in 2019 and according to the national safety council work-related injuries in the u.s in 2019 alone cost the nation 171 billion dollars and again here is where a tesla bot shines because if a tesla bot gets damaged it doesn't feel pain it doesn't slow down the entire company you just assign another tesla bot to do the task while the injured tesla bot gets repaired kind of taking your car in for service new servo motor a hand unit and tesla bot is back ready for service but i want to go back to something we were talking about just a couple minutes ago when we were talking about hiring yeah i think i know where you're going with this i mean we kind of mentioned that part of the hiring process is training but actually training is something that companies need to do all the time as processes change your employees change positions or as products and services and software change human employees need to constantly be trained and training usually means one-on-one or classroom type settings where production stops and hours of new information and processes and skills have to be learned by employees here is yet another area that tesla bot shines because once one tesla bot knows how to do a task then all tesla bots know how to do that task and because tesla bots are autonomous training no longer means teams of human software programmers coding individual robot arms for days you just tell tesla bot what you need done in a controlled test environment it learns and then uploads that data to the entire fleet or army of tesla bots so now they are all experts imagine having a factory full of perfectly coordinated hard-working skilled workers that can be taught new tasks in a fraction of the time as humans vertical integration is the holy grail of manufacturing it means taking in raw mater materials and being able to create as many of the parts as you need to make your final product in-house no need to rely on as many outside suppliers as your competition if you can make the doors seats wiring harnesses etc by yourself so what does that mean less cost for one because you don't have suppliers marking up the prices reliable supply chain for another as we've seen recently one hiccup on the other side of the world due to anything from a stuck ship in a canal to a coveted shutdown can create unpredictable supply chain disruptions that can last weeks or months when a company decides what they can make in-house one of the biggest factors in that decision is usually labor the cost of skilled labor to make that part and the availability of that labor where you need it near your factories and again tesla bots solves this problem you don't have to pay tesla bot tesla bot works for free or at least it'll work for tesla for free for tesla we have yet to see what model tesla we use to sell a tesla bot to you in the market will tesla sell you a tesla bot or will they lease it to you and how much will tesla be able to charge well to answer that question we kind of already know the answer the price the market will bear for labor is already known and that's because we know what humans get paid to do certain jobs for instance the average annual auto worker salary in california is 33 589 okay so that's what tesla can charge every year to lease me an auto worker robot not so fast tesla can actually charge you more how can tesla charge me more you just said i could hire a human for 33 000. why would i pay tesla more than that well remember a tesla bot has many advantages over a human that human auto worker will work 40 hours a week for that salary but a tesla bot can work much longer hours oh right i mean theoretically tesla bot could work every hour of every day no time off no vacations yeah except for replenishing its power supply and maybe occasional maintenance that tesla bot could work the full 168 hours in a week but what about charging its batteries you mentioned well i have a couple ideas number one is that tesla bot could plug itself in when it's working at the workstation oh right i mean if it's going to be working in a small area of the factory you just boop and then it can work off grid power or tesla bot could have hot swappable battery packs because i don't think tesla wants these tesla bots to have downtime while waiting for batteries to charge they are way too valuable for that okay so you're saying that a tesla bot is worth four times a human worker because it can work over four times the hours in a week yeah i mean that makes sense right it's hiring four employees instead of one for the the amount of labor that you get out of it okay so that would be 134 356 dollars a year but you're forgetting some of the other benefits of tesla bot that we discussed a tesla bot saves 4 425 dollars in average hiring costs because no need for job listings interviews salary negotiations handbooks name tags etc and tesla bot saves uh one thousand two hundred fifty two dollars in average initial training costs not to mention thousands more in trading costs down the road when something about the job changes companies save 130 days of hiring and training right off the bat because tesla bots can start immediately and let's not forget about worker benefits employers have to compete to get human workers to want to work for them so employers have to stay competitive with worker benefits 401ks break rooms with fridges and food and coffee and health plans and bathrooms and someone to clean the bathrooms and parking lots for their workers to park and wait no parking lots no bathrooms to build maintain and clean no break rooms no health care yeah do you see how much employers will be able to save when they can eliminate all these things not to mention all the employees that they normally would hire to manage the human resources the bathrooms the cafeterias the break rooms the plowing of the parking lots in the winter etc etc crap i never thought about that yeah and we haven't even gotten to another benefit tesla bot has over humans efficiency humans lose focus they talk to their friends they take phone calls they get tired tesla bots just keep working endlessly and efficiently tesla bots can shave time off each task they do and work as close to 100 efficiency every time imagine every bolt torqued exactly to spec every time another huge benefit of tesla bot is data collection if you want to monitor your human workforce you either need to surround them with cameras or get them to fill out spreadsheets or monitor them with biofeedback devices tesla bots will share everything they're doing all the time from the torque their left hand is applying when attaching a part to how many parts they installed in an hour this is invaluable to a factory that's trying to run at peak efficiency figuring out where the weak links in production are or if we add another tesla bot over here how much will output improve with human employees we try to attain this data through work meetings but let's be honest how reliable are we humans at collecting data when we're already busy working because picture this if you tell your employees to manually track their mileage let's say and they spend just 12 minutes a day doing that that's one hour per week and 52 hours per year spent just keeping track of mileage and that's why so many companies spend so much money hiring consultants to watch their employees and tell the executives how to improve management consulting is a 250 billion dollar a year industry in the us alone tesla bot collects this data practically for free and let's not forget communication if you take a big factory let's say tesla's fremont factory with about 10 000 employees imagine having to communicate with them and between them every day it's a logistical nightmare but tesla bots can all communicate with each other and the central command center instantaneously through wi-fi right need eight percent of your workforce today to shift to working at these other workstations to increase the number of parts upstream just send a command and off they go no questions asked tesla bots will be in constant communication so they will know when they are needed somewhere else in the factory they will be able to communicate when a certain part is getting low and instead of communicating it to a manager who then has to communicate to another team of employees somewhere else in the factory and they don't get along tesla's will be able to communicate these things that would have usually taken humans many minutes or hours in milliseconds so even though the first generation of tesla bots will most likely be somewhat limited in what they can do and even though they will likely cost many millions of dollars each to build they will be worth probably around a million dollars each where do you get that figure well we said that four human auto workers would cost about 134 000 a year and so i figure for the sake of argument that is conservatively what a tesla bot will be worth if a tesla bot has a working life of seven or eight years before it wears out or becomes obsolete then it would be worth around a million dollars so as long as tesla can eventually get below that price significantly tesla bot should be profitable can you make a robot for less than a million dollars yep how are you so confident because they already do make autonomous robots that are much bigger and sell them for about sixty thousand dollars and they have an industry-leading margin so each one they sell at that price is very profitable what tesla already makes robots yeah they're cars tesla cars are autonomous robots on wheels a frame battery pack motors computers and some sensors that's a tesla model 3 for instance take away the four wheels add two arms and two legs two hands and two feet give it a much smaller battery pack than a car powerful computer a couple cameras similar autonomous software and a bunch of servo motors and you got yourself a humanoid autonomous robot all in all way less stuff than a car i mean a model 3 has 4 000 pounds of stuff tesla bot is probably only going to have about 250 pounds of stuff or less than a tenth so it's possible a tesla bot will cost tesla less than twenty thousand dollars each to build when they ramp up to full production in a few years but let's say i'm wrong and it costs tesla five times that or a hundred thousand dollars to build and even if tesla can only lease it for a hundred thousand dollars per year that would still be a 700 margin on each tesla bot they make and that leads to my next point about why elon is saying this will be bigger for tesla than the auto business for the first time in human history as elon set out to do we may be looking at a machine that can make the machine tesla bots will eventually be able to build more tesla bots if it tesla bot uses less than one tenth the material that a tesla car does and takes up one tenth the space to build and if tesla bots can make more tesla bots at a gigafactory we could be talking about production rates of a million tesla bots per year per gigafactory in just a few years imagine in 2026 tesla is producing 4 million tesla bots per year leasing them for a hundred thousand dollars each per year that's 400 billion dollars in revenue in four years but i mean tesla made 53 billion in revenue in 2021. now can you see why elon said this will be bigger than tesla's auto business and tesla will have a monopoly yeah i mean tesla's way ahead of the competition with tesla bot so much in fact that most people think that elon's crazy they think this dancing robot is a pipe dream but if tesla can do it if we see something impressive on september 30th at ai day number two then we will know that tesla is on track to something the world has never seen before okay you've convinced me tesla bots are going to be a big deal for tesla and for the manufacturing oh no i think it's going to be much bigger than that bigger than automotive for tesla and manufacturing for the world yeah who said tesla bots will only work in factories well i mean that's what we've been talking about this whole episode i know but think about it if a tesla bot can build a car can it also mow your lawn i suppose so then tesla bot just transformed the residential and commercial landscaping industry that's a hundred billion dollar plus worldwide industry okay wow and don't you think a tesla bot will be able to climb a ladder and hold a paintbrush uh yeah sure yeah all right then tesla bot can paint every home building bridge business in the world tesla bot just disrupted the painting industry in the us alone that employs over 250 000 people and is worth 35 billion dollars a year and if tesla bot can climb a ladder and hold a nail gun then you can disrupt the construction industry yup that's a 10.7 trillion dollar worldwide industry just in the u.s construction jobs account for 7.5 million workers do you think tesla about will be able to make a sandwich or bust a table yeah so that's over 12 million jobs in the u.s uh how about change a diaper and read a book so tesla buck can do child care sure why not that's over a million people and how about teach a class there are over 3.6 million teachers just in the us i mean i could go on just about every job you can think of tesla bot will be able to do it faster cheaper longer better so tesla bot is going to disrupt labor yup and labor is the economy tesla bot will change everything just you wait and see join us on september 30th for tesla's ai day number two where we are going to be live streaming it and we are going to be doing a pre and post show as well we're going to have a special guest who will help us analyze what we learned during the presentation this could be one of the biggest most transformational presentations so far in human history or the tesla bot could fall over and not be able to get back up we just don't know thank you so much for watching and being part of our community of thoughtful curious folks hit the button if you enjoyed this and hit the button so you don't miss any upcoming videos we'll see you next week now you know,3
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJl35aIy5pOVBHvoGgqavrdJ,vB78qCS1jvw,hey everybody i'm zach and i'm jesse and you're watching in depth on now you know [music] um what are you doing now oh sorry i didn't see you there uh i'm coming up with a better full self-driving algorithm i figure i'll just work day and night and beat tesla to the punch and you plan on doing that by looking around with one eye closed i mean i have some ideas but i'm not sure where to start have you tried going to brilliant.org our sponsors of the show yes brilliant is awesome but do they have a course on how to beat tesla not exactly but they have courses that i think you should take before you take on tesla what well you could take brilliance course called introduction to neural networks that would be a good start oh cool this course teaches things decision boundaries and shape recognizing networks and hidden layers yeah brilliant has so many cool courses on so many awesome topics from logic and pre-algebra to computer science and probability and i love brilliance courses because they know how to make learning stick in your brain all of brilliant's courses have storytelling and use interactive problems and hints and brilliant has fun quizzes at the end of each lesson to make sure you understood what you learned before you move on to support our and learn more about brilliant go to brilliant.org now you know and sign up for free and also the first 200 people that go to that link will get 20 off the annual premium subscription okay so when i'm done with this course and i roll up my zsd beta want to be my first beta tester zsd zack self driving duh i think i'll pass if you drive an ev and you need to get from point a to point b to point c well then you should be using a better route planner because they have the all important waypoints so the link in the description for a 30-day trial to the premium app what's uh what's up well have you heard about that new law in california that's bringing a breath of fresh air to the state oh is that the one from last year where california regulators approved a first of its kind rule to force automakers to sell more electric work trucks and delivery vans uh no is it the one where governor newsom ordered regulators to ban the sale of all new gas-powered cars and trucks in california by 2035. nope that's awesome but what we're talking about is a new law and this one's different it affects lawn equipment we're talking leaf blowers lawnmowers chainsaws hedge trimmers brush cutters anything that uses a small off-road engine or soar and it would ban new gas-powered lawn equipment in california by 2024. okay so they're going to ban it yeah so the law which was authored by democratic assemblyman mark berman who's a democrat from palo alto was signed into law on october 9th by governor gavin newsom wait so it's going to ban lawn equipment how are people going to get their lawns manicured well it's going to be in gas-powered lawn equipment so uh if you want to buy lawn equipment you'll have to buy electric electric or manual or yeah i guess you could still manually mow your bring the site back but the law will give about 30 million dollars to professional landscapers and gardeners to help pay for new equipment and we want to stress that existing gas-powered equipment could still be used this law just affects new lawn equipment sales in the state of california so i've heard some mixed reporting on this i heard 2022 or 2024 that this is going to go into effect yeah so the law tells the california air resources board or carb to write regulations no later than july 1st 2022. so that's about 8 months from now and that will bring a new ban on soars that will go into effect on january 1st of 2024 if they feel it's feasible why wouldn't it be feasible well my guess is that there will be some groups that will push back at the open meetings of carb saying that 2024 may not give enough time for manufacturers to make enough electric leaf blowers and lawnmowers so i don't really understand the big deal about this law was someone outside of mark berman's home with a leaf blower constantly and he's just ah i'm gonna pass a law against that oh i hate it maybe uh but i think it goes bigger than that okay all right so let's look at the big picture here there are 16.7 million small engines in california and about 13 million cars this gives you some idea of how many of these small engines there are in california okay and one hour of leaf blowing equals the emissions of 1100 miles driven in the average car so a 2017 toyota camry one hour of leaf blowing equals driving that car 1 100 miles well okay how is that even possible well that's because as we're going to talk about in the show small engines are dirty small engines emit more nitrous oxide and reactive organic gases than light duty vehicles do so every day in california small engines emit 16.8 tons of nitrous oxide and 125 tons of reactive organic gases okay now that sounds big i'm trying to figure out the scale of this though okay you know i know that you might have a leaf blower and it's maybe it's sitting in the garage um and you might use it from time to time or you know you have your lawnmower and you might use it once a week uh but then i also know that there's landscaping companies so i can't really wrap my head around this can you help me yeah so let's look at these numbers extrapolated right so there are about 55 000 landscape companies in california and over 133 000 landscape employees that are registered that are registered exactly okay so assuming that california landscapers own about a million pieces of equipment that's what we estimated they own we did some back of the napkin math and the small engines emissions in california are equivalent to over a trillion miles driven in cars every year just in california that sounds a lot it is uh let me put that in perspective okay uh californians drove 340 billion miles last year in their cars so that would be if california had three times more cars on the road emitting pollution or it'd be if there were three more california's all pumping their car exhaust into the real california every year right and this is why you can see this is a big deal wow i mean i hadn't really thought about it i mean if you think about lawn equipment you're just thinking of it's small it's not that big so you might think that the impact of it isn't that large but here's the problem i'm having with this law okay um if i'm a landscaping company and i gotta now quickly start thinking about replacing all my equipment because you know equipment breaks and by 2024 i'm gonna have to buy non-gas powered equipment uh let's just talk about backpack leaf blowers that's the staple of landscaping companies what am i gonna do okay well let's first talk about backpack leaf blowers so let's take a look at this model this one is by steel i see a lot i mean almost every landscaping company that i've seen in my personal experience they always have the orange things on their back that's always very popular okay um so i did some research uh these weigh 22 pounds 22 pounds okay uh they put out 500 cfm that's cubic feet per minute so how much air are they how much air they're blowing out um and you know it's 150 miles an hour of air or whatever in terms of sound they do uh 76 decibels oh that's how loud it is that's how loud it is um then of course there's uh the operations time so one gas tank will get you about an hour of operation oh and then you refill it and then you have to refill it okay so how much does that cost to fuel it for a day of work so let's say that you were going to run it all day long which okay might not be that you know you mean eight hours an eight hour day i know that you probably aren't going to do that but let's just just so we have some metric so it uses about 0.45 gallons an hour so half a gallon an hour that's the one tank okay so we're talking about 3.6 gallons in a day okay in california the price of gas is on average four dollars and 44 cents a gallon okay um so you're talking about 16 of fuel for a eight hour day of running your leaf blower hang on i remember that with my two-stroke engines i needed to add something to the gasoline uh an oil you're right yeah those little those little guys those little cute things they're not cheap no so i did the math on that that would bring you to more 29 a day because you have to pay for the two-stroke oil to add to your gasoline 29 bucks a day in fuel alone in fuel no if you ran it all day long um one last piece though i know that with you know my luck with two-stroke engines was really bad i do tons of maintenance all the time what's the maintenance on an engine well see the thing was you didn't do the preventative maintenance that you should have been doing so the engine got you know pretty much destroyed uh and that's why i had to keep bringing to that guy down the street right if you wanted to do proper maintenance you'd want to wash the air filter every 10 hours of operation hang on every 10 hours i mean if that's every two days yeah i mean maybe you could get away with a week if you don't use the the thing but so yeah let's say every maybe twice a week okay you're gonna be doing that you want to check the spark plug every 25 hours that's once a week right and so you're taking it out you're cleaning it you're doing all that kind of maintenance and maybe you're replacing stuff maybe you're replacing the air filter if it finally gets clogged up okay but lastly is the actual price of the unit how much do these cost um this one in particular is 429 all right so we know how much this one costs and everything and we know everything about it but uh i need to replace this with an electric one all i've seen are the handheld ones that's not going to cut it i don't think for most landscapers well no i mean you just you're not really marketed to because you're a consumer so you aren't really marketed to the other things so i mean you know take your pick do you want a husqvarna oh wait there's one those are electric yeah so you could get you know cobalt i guess that's the lowe's brand and you know there's ryobi um let's just choose uh the ego for example you know out of example all right so let's see the gas powered model was 500 cfm what is this one 600 wait it's more i can blow more more power uh coming out of the electric one okay but it's got a lot of batteries so it must weigh a ton weighs 12 pounds wait you said the other one weighed 22 pounds yeah weighs 10 pounds lighter with the battery installed all right but i gotcha uh how long does it run oh on a charge yeah uh three hours okay well there you go you can't use it i'm a landscaping company i gotta use this all day oh no you can replace the battery so i mean if you bought this and you also bought a weed whacker that also comes with a battery um or a strimmer for brits that would mean that you'd have interchangeable batteries you'd be using one and you'd be charging the other one and then when you that one's depleted you'd put in the charge oh wait so in the three hours that i'm using this up it would take about three hours to charge so i just keep swapping them out you just keep swapping them out so i can go all day i can go as long as i want right and i mean a lot of these batteries right now if you buy just the battery it's way overpriced but if you buy it with a tool it's usually there's no cost added for the battery which is weird but basically if you were buying a set of tools all within one brand all the batteries would be compatible with each other and you'd be able to interchange them okay how loud is it 64 decibels that's over 10 times quieter than the gas one um and is it electric cars because it's electric i don't have to do any maintenance to it right there's no air filter to change there's no spark plug to look at you're just literally pulling the battery out putting it back in because you're charging the battery that's okay but i have to charge the battery there's some cost there don't just overlook that i have to plug it into the wall how much does that cost every day okay so the battery is about 420 watt hours so let's let's say that the three hours that i gave you was wrong let's say that the battery only lasts two hours that would mean that you'd be charging up four batteries a day that would put you at around two kilowatt hours for an eight-hour day of constant work how much does it cost 40 cents no i said to charge it all day right 40 cents for the whole day for eight hours of continuous running no no because you just said it was 29 to do the gas powered so i want to know how much it costs to fill up the electric right if we're talking electrons that's something that you're paying for yeah 40 cents no no but you said it was 29 right it's 40 cents for this because electricity is so efficient wait what so okay let's let's say for example that you think that the charger itself that's going to be charging the battery let's say that you think that it's 50 efficient you're throwing away half the energy and you're going to be paying for four kilowatt hours a day that would be 80 cents let's say you think that the battery will only last for one hour instead of two okay then we're talking about a dollar and sixty cents this would pay for itself in a month and a half yeah it would be paid off in a month and a half of what i would have saved on gas savings alone okay but i think i still got you because this must cost a fortune compared to the gas powered model cost 400 with the battery wait a minute you said that the gas powered one was 429 wait a minute you're saying the price is less it costs less to fuel it there's no maintenance i can use it all day long it's quieter it weighs less and it blows more air wait you just said it's better in every category yes it is so that means that using an electric model the amount of money i'm saving every day i'm saving over 25 bucks a day right it pays for itself in a month and a half now it's different you know you have to you have to change out a battery pack and you have to make sure yeah but i'm urging one drive to the gas station right no so it's a different experience and i think that that's why people are a little first to change okay but hang on that was a leaf blower i'm a landscaping company i mow a lot of lawns i need a professional lawnmower right and so here's where things get a little tricky because when we talk about lawn mowers you're used to seeing lawn mowers at places home depot at lowe's menards you know you walk in and in the front there's a bunch of lawnmowers lined up and so you might be thinking those are the lawn mowers we're talking about no uh if we're talking about a landscaping company that does a lot of lawns they need high power long lasting tools right so that brings us to the gas model that i'm going to choose okay i'm going to i'm going to go for a john deere no yeah very common i'm going to go for the z970r that'd be my choice it has a deck width of 60 inches horsepower of 35 35 horsepower there's an asterisk because obviously it's a gas engine so that's only when you're topping it out it has a gas tank that'll last about six hours uh that gas tank is 11.5 gallons you know what's funny i had a 1991 honda civic my first cars and had the same size gas tank wow the john deere can go 12 miles an hour okay i'm sure the honda civic could have gone faster oh before we get into anything else what does it cost oh uh 17 579 i mean this is why you're saying don't compare it to what you see in home depot this is a this is a high price machine that lasts a long time the tough part here is um you need to go to a dealer to buy one of these because these run every day all day you're you're buying a piece of equipment this is not consumer grade right um everything here that you're looking at is metal all right so how much does this thing cost to fill up the tank um so at four dollars and 44 cents a gallon and it's 11 and a half gallons that's about 51 dollars okay to fuel up so it's kind of and then you know and that gives me six hours of run time gives you six hours of runtime okay yeah all right so what am i gonna do because i've never seen an electric lawnmower that's anything beyond consumer level exactly because you've never needed to get one so you've never had to go to a dealer to buy a lawnmower you've just gone to home depot right so but i mean are there any yes if i had to choose one i would definitely go with the mean green mowers okay they are an all-electric brand oh nice they make their own mowers in the united states from scratch of course nice i would choose the rival 60. so again we have a deck width of 60 inches okay so same as the other one it is a 36 horsepower equivalent okay so same same power yeah i mean it's the same power but obviously it's doing it in a bunch of different ways it has more motors than just one motor and so that means that there's no belts we'll get into that in a minute okay so it has seven hours of continuous run time okay um how do they how do they do that 22 kilowatt hour battery pack that's a big battery yeah it's the same as my leaf wow so if you turn my leaf into a lawnmower you'd end up with this thing top speed 11.5 miles an hour same it's just about the same how much does it cost to fuel it so at 16.8 cents per kilowatt hour that would be about 3.69 per charge now again i'm asking you how much does it cost to run it all day well so that would get you seven hours uh of course the the gas one was fifty one dollars to get you six hours i'm sorry you're saying it's gonna cost me about fifty dollars cheaper to run this all day you know maybe 49 48. okay but this thing must cost a fortune the price is higher it's uh 23 000 gotcha see it's higher the other one's only 17.5 right but as you were just talking about with fuel cost if you look into the return on investment you break even in 400 hours wait i i run this for 400 hours and now it's costing me the same as the gas power model yeah and you're saving every hour after that and that's before you even factor in maintenance oh right because the gas powered model needs constant maintenance and that's before you factor in that you now have happier customers you can go to your customer and you can say hey i have an electric lawnmower which is way quieter oh i can start earlier and go later you can do that you can also say hey we're good for the environment uh we're not going to stink up your house when we're driving around you're going to be able to go outside and have lunch while we're cutting the grass right we're not going to be bothering you that much and if you factor in those two considerations you could break even in as little as three months and again every day after that you're saving almost 50 bucks a day but you know what when it comes to maintenance on gas-powered equipment you don't have to take our word for it here's an expert we know who makes his living with chainsaws and lawn mowers and leaf blowers tell us about maintenance on your machines you've got chainsaws and all that tell me about just maintenance on your chainsaws it's a never ending battle doing the uh maintenance on chainsaws you got to talk about your carburetors you got to talk about your fuel filters you gotta talk about what kind of gas you're putting in there nothing with ethanol whatsoever big no-no you want the high-test jet fuel you want that run in right and tight at all times so how often do you have to send your chain sign for maintenance ah geez well if you don't maintain it probably every six months give or take and what's that cost definitely depends on the severity of the wear and tear if you're not taking care of it most of the time they tell you to throw down buy a new one it's a consumer just keep taking it all in how about lawn mowers how often do those have to be maintained try and stay on top of that a car every x amount of hours i my industry i try and stay on top of it once a month it's uh super crucial since it's my livelihood so once again it goes back to those fuel filters those oil filters those spark plugs stay on top of it the gas these days it's getting it's getting more and more corn fed a lot of ethanol it just makes it run dog so you run a pretty normal size landscaping company what would you say you're spending on maintenance in terms of time and money every year if you stay on top of it it'll take 5-10 percent of pay out of you if you're not to stand on top of it it'll take 20 30. you're swapping in and out i if i'm hauling and getting things done and i don't have the time to do maintenance it gets expensive it's the pros with the cons or it's the cons with the pros i should say of business money takes money to make i want to talk about some of the unmeasurable benefits of going electric because i think we just talked about some you know the money aspect but there's these other benefits and the first one i want to talk about is decibels so you had a lot of great stats that we just talked about and one of them was decibels and that's how loud something is it's easy to look at the number and say that electric is better because it has a lower number but many people don't know this but i was a sound engineer for many years and decibels is one of the least understood numbering systems that i've ever heard to me it's right up there with the dewey decimal system and the richter scale and i've lived through thousands of earthquakes in fact after the northridge california quake of 94 i experienced so many aftershocks that i used to call out the number after each aftershock and i got quite good at it but most people don't know the difference between you know a 5.4 earthquake and a 6.4 but that difference of 1 on the richter scale makes a heck of a difference same thing with decibels 64 decibels is us talking here 75 decibels is the number that's steel rated for their gas leaf blower but that's at a distance of 50 feet from the unit right many top brand gas powered backpack leaf blowers tested by pro tool reviews are between 101 and 104 decibels at the operator's ear now again i do yeah it's a logarithmic scale i just said a word and you probably don't know what it means it means that every time you go up by 10 you are doubling how loud it is so if i go from 10 which is almost silent up to 20 it's twice as loud but it was already pretty quiet to begin with if i go from 64 which is me talking right now and i double it that's really freaking loud and i don't even think i hit 75 no i don't know because that's again a leaf blower right at 50 feet away right now you're talking about 101 at the operator's ear that's four times as loud as a conversation and so 101-104 that's rock concert level so imagine that now you go out to work today to leaf blow for you know four hours six hours eight hours and it's being at a rock concert for the entire time it's having kiss on your back right and and this is why osha has a limit of 90 dbs to be able to do hardly anything and that's why every time you see a person with a leaf blower they have to wear headphones right and that brings it down 20 decibels so that way you're only getting 80 decibels in your ears now we switched to an ego electric lawnmower about three years ago you can see our review of it right here but let me tell you just from a sound perspective it is a game changer i can make phone calls while mowing the lawn i can now listen to music on earbuds while i'm mowing the lawn except for the sound of the blade cutting the grass it's practically silent i can mow it any time of the day or night without bothering anyone in my house or any of my neighbors with us switching to electric lawn gear this means that the operators can actually start enjoying their work a little bit more and still retain their hearing and their sanity because let's be honest having the constant loud sound of engine noise in your ear for hours every day is stressful and stress is an actual killer it will kill you now another unmeasurable benefit of going electric is gas cans it may not sound a big deal practically every landscaper and homeowner has one in fact americans alone buy approximately 20 million plastic gas cans every year there are approximately 100 million plastic gas cans right now in use in the u.s gas cans that's this is a benefit we're gonna get rid of gas cans that's gonna be better well yeah i mean electric lawn equipment doesn't need gas cans so what why is that awesome well for one thing you don't have to go to the gas station and fill them up all the time i know it sounds a little thing but it's time out of your day right i mean homeowners let's be honest driving home from the gas station with a gas can in the car is a smelly affair your hands your car yeah really so you're worried about stinky gas cans in your car that's that's your big argument it's not my big argument just my first argument according to the consumer product safety commission there are approximately one death and 100 emergency room visits every year in the u.s due to flashback explosions occurring while pouring gas in and out of gas cans that's just flashback explosions and that's just where there's either a death or an emergency room visit that's not oh honey i blew myself up go lay on that couch harold i'll get you some tea you know that's not counting that that that's i blew up and now i need to go to the emergency room and that's just flashback explosions now my next argument is according to the national fire protection association in the u.s approximately 800 gasoline fires occur in homes every year killing over 36 people and causing 35 million dollars in property damage most of those fires occurred from fuel spills or when gasoline was stored too close to heat sources again gas cans oh and over 17 million gallons of gasoline are spilled each year refueling lawn and garden equipment more oil than was spilled by the exxon valdez so my little argument sounds so little anymore so this is the true drop in the buckets kind of thing where yeah every american putting gas in their mower and oh i'm spilled a little bit whatever you add that all up and it's worse than a oil spill every year every year every year and all the houses burning down and all the explosions all the deaths not to mention all the gasoline that you get on your hands and probably gives you cancer correct okay well enough of this earthy crunchy touchy-feely kind of stuff deaths okay whatever how about the actual measurable benefits of going electric with lawn equipment okay well according to the epa the environmental protection agency one gas lawnmower spews 88 pounds of co2 and 34 pounds of other pollutants into the atmosphere every year so every weekend about 54 million americans mow their lawns using 800 million gallons of gas per year now that's less than one percent of all the gas burned in cars in the u.s but because these engines are so dirty according to the epa gas mowers just gas mowers represent five percent of u.s air pollution how no no no stop that they must be lying who the epa yeah that can't be you put the gas it's the same amount of fuel going into the how do you have five times the pollution okay well new cars have increasingly more stringent regulations about how much pollution they can emit right auto manufacturers are supposed to yes i'm talking to you volkswagen install technologies and controls catalytic converters that limit the amount of pollutants coming out of the tailpipe because let's not forget an internal combustion engine is combusting or exploding gasoline thousands of times per minute boom boom boom and each explosion has to vent that exploded gas out the tailpipe but with small engines your lawnmower that exploded gas just comes right out the side and into your face all right there's no catalytic converter that it goes into nope so i mean when you see that little puff of smoke when you uh what are we talking about here they're pumping out all sorts of dangerous pollutants into our air benzene which is carcinogenic carbon monoxide that's just a poisonous gas okay nitrous oxide hydrocarbons and particulate matter which we talk a lot about on the show even if you don't care about the health of our planet you should care about particulate matter pm10 and smaller are particles that are 10 microns and smaller and can pass through the blood-brain barrier in your body they cause respiratory diseases including asthma pulmonary diseases decreased lung functions heart attacks cancer kidney disease dementia and premature death premature death what does that look well according to the world health organization in 2019 99 of the world population was living in places where the air quality guideline levels were not met why do you think that is largely because of things this ambient air pollution in both cities and rural areas was estimated to cause 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide in 2016. and i just want to go back to that 99 of the world population because there's certain parts of the world where that pollution is caused by people cooking with wood or stuff in their homes without proper ventilation and we would call those places the third world right it's funny how 99 of the world has poor air quality what's the first world running into oh well we have guys outside of our house leaf blowing and stuff that causing air pollution which is making us just as sick as the people who are cooking with wood inside their houses exactly but i'm sure that a lot of people will complain big government is controlling our freedoms but remember for decades government has done nothing to stop people from buying these super polluting small engines government's job is to protect us and now we finally have the technology electric lawn equipment to replace these gas-powered machines with clean ones it's your job to embrace this new technology and help spread the word on why california's new law is important because what happens in california usually spreads to other states across the united states and can then affect what happens in other countries around the world now for those of you who are worried that this is just going to lead to more bans and legislation in certain states and countries factor in what we just told you about running that lawn mower the savings are going to be enormous so for those landscapers who have old machinery and are going to need to buy new machinery in 2024 they're going to have to buy an electric version and they might start to realize the benefits of electric and they're going to start telling their buddies on the east coast in the midwest in other countries around the world hey you should really try out this electric lawnmower i'm saving so much money i could hire a new guy it's an insane amount of money that you're spending just burning fuel right it's ten dollars an hour in gas to run one of those large lawn mowers right compared to cents a lot of your time is spent going to the gas station and filling up you know containers of gas that you then have to store places and and keep track of when that'll all go away as well right oh that's the two-stroke gas that's the stuff that's going to go in my in my engine you know that can get confusing if you screw that up now you have lost time you have to fix that stuff all the maintenance you gotta keep track of i mean you can't take on that next job tomorrow because you gotta work on your lawnmower first and on top of that we're gonna have more companies competing to bring down the price to increase features i mean we're just i think scratching the surface i mean i love mean green mowers the one that we were looking at but i don't think that they're the best company they're just one of the first companies to come out with a commercial lawnmower right but some people will say we won't have enough batteries to do all this okay but keep in mind that small engines are small yeah they don't need hardly the energy that a car does so even though there are a lot of small engines five million lawn mowers for instance are sold in the u.s every year the average electric lawnmower doesn't need that many battery cells i saw you doing some calculations earlier how many battery cells go in the average lawnmower so for the consumer model um about 56 cells 18 650s oh we have one right here yeah so 56 of these right to power that okay how many of these cells go into let's say a model s or model x around 7 000. okay so uh over 100 times more battery cells need to go into an electric car than into a lawnmower so you get the idea here if we can make enough cells for electric cars we can make plenty of cells for electric lawn equipment and the same thing goes for electricity we are as we speak building more renewable energy onto our grid than any other power source yeah we'll have enough electricity for all the electric cars and trucks and we only need a tiny percentage of that for all the electric lawn equipment so don't let someone in your life tell you well that's not going to happen because we won't have enough batteries and we won't have enough electricity we will and i think that this is going to lead to a major mindset change i mean i already talked about you know landscapers talking to their friends in other states getting them to switch to electric but just think about this kids growing up in california aren't going to have a gas-powered lawn mower so when dad brings you out to the garage and goes all right son we're going to look at this lawnmower today we need to fix it you're not going to be talking about you know uh seals and we're not going to need to fix this is what you're saying it's going to be electric right it's going to you're just going to say come on to the garage son we need to charge this lawnmower before we can mow the lawn i think most people's experience with learning about gas engines you learn about in the garage on a lawn mower something that isn't going to kill you quite as much as a car would and you know it's fun if you're looking you know you're oh there won't be any of these projects left in the garage with dad you know i can't work on the gas powered lawnmower how about building a solar shed for the lawnmower that just charges up all of your equipment that'll be a fun project and with more batteries in the world means that there's going to be more batteries that need to be recycled batteries that you know oh one cell in this pack is bad but you could replace it and essentially have a new pack for very little money so there's gonna be a lot of fun little projects and hacks but yeah a solar shed because you don't need that much energy you could literally just take one solar panel that you find on the side of the road or something put it on your shed and it could charge up all your equipment over the span of a week and then you could you know mow your lawn come back and charge it up all over again for free yeah no i mean i love this idea we've talked about this on some projects we've done in the past where there's just these batteries are in everything now they're in your electric toothbrush so if you want to fix a battery pack for your lawnmower it's pretty easy to do and these skills are not going to be going away batteries are the future so it's great to have small scale examples where you don't have to build a whole car so i want to make some predictions here i mean chinese companies could jump into this segment i mean they're already making most of the e-bike components right and these components for lawn equipment aren't that different lithium-ion batteries with bms's and chargers and motors and i think this is a huge opportunity for companies to take advantage of i mean think about it there are a bunch of older companies that have market share in the 20 billion plus consumer and professional lawn equipment worldwide market i mean take a look at these companies here they're kind of the existing companies that make these things but most of their equipment is powered by gas engines which are made by these companies yeah i mean just mean green mowers you could start a company where you take a bunch of components and make a mower it's so much more efficient i mean we've had some of our viewers who have converted gas lawn mowers to electric and they've shown that it's more than 10 times more efficient to have an electric one right if we're talking about energy i mean a gallon of gas has 2.2 kilowatt hours of energy in it so a battery that has uh less than a quarter of that can do way more work than that gallon of gas right because most of that gas's energy gets wasted in heat or sound right so those two things that you do not want to have suddenly aren't there so instead of having to wear hearing protection you don't and now the work is just being done quietly right and i mean imagine how much cleaner the air in california is going to be soon i mean remember three less california's of cars driving there every year so i mean 2024 i know it won't change overnight it's not going to replace all of those but gas-powered engines these small ones don't last forever and so i'm guessing that by about the end of this decade we're going to be having in california a whole lot cleaner air but let's talk about beyond california it's up to you the residents of the 49 other states and the dozens of other countries to say to your lawmakers i want what california has no more gas-powered lawn equipment i want clean air too and that's all it's going to take because if it can work in california it'll work anywhere and why has it worked in california why has this happened i think that it's for two reasons okay number one tesla i think that tesla has pushed people to go hey i just bought an electric car it drives all by itself on little lithium battery cells and it works great i want to do the same thing why can't i do the same thing with my lawn equipment yeah so that i think has pushed the innovation curve a little bit faster and that caused reason number two now there is actual milan equipment that you can buy exactly that is fully electric and so when lawmakers are going to actually go make this a law if there were no alternatives to gas-powered lawn equipment they really couldn't make this a law they would not have the support of the people they would not be able to with a straight face say hey you can't buy that anymore and and landscapers would go well what am i supposed to buy i don't know something else something it's coming don't worry about it you wouldn't be able to do that i think that the exact same thing is going to happen as we scale up i think that large really giant smelly diesel trucks that you probably hear driving down your street and you go wow i can hear that in my house those are going to go away because they are also polluting and they are loud and nobody likes them as soon as they're electric you're not even going to be thinking about them and let's talk about electric planes exactly all of these things and more and it starts small starts with lawn equipment yeah i mean so thank you tesla for changing more than just the cars we drive but indirectly for cleaning up the air we breathe and i honestly think it is because of tesla that we're talking about this law today and thank you so much for watching i think that just thinking about this kind of stuff and talking about it with your friends can have huge impacts and you know try out some electric lawn equipment there's some that just plugs right into the wall you don't even have to buy any batteries and it's way cheaper they're not as powerful because you can't pull that much energy from the wall but it's still cool yeah but there's so many battery-powered ones that are really cool the prices have dropped the the performance has gone up we've reviewed a bunch on the so go check them out and then the next time you're out in your lawn you're influencing your whole neighborhood and because there isn't that much maintenance you might even consider sharing it right just go over to your neighbor hey do you need these trimmers no i think it's a great idea on your block one of you get the chainsaw one of you get the hedge trimmer one of you get the lawnmower and then you can just share all the batteries and it's just and it's a nice community again yeah and speaking of nice communities i want to thank our patreon patrons yeah we can't do this show without them if you don't know what we're talking about there's this website called patreon and you can help support creators and we're one of the creators

Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJl35aIy5pOVBHvoGgqavrdJ,eNGfR1NLpBc,"[music] all right well i am here with mitch from electric cuts and uh mitch is up in canada right now and thank you so much mitch for taking the time to talk to us today thanks for having me um mitch uh and i were talking a few weeks ago mitch has this really cool company in in canada where he is doing all of his landscaping work with electric machines so i guess my first question to you mitch is what made you think of doing this with um with electric lawnmowers and trimmers and all that as opposed to the regular gas powered ones well uh initially i guess it started with uh my interest in tesla and elon musk and so from there i just thought some way to be different right cu there's lots of people that have lawn care companies and it's just you just go out and get a truck and trailer and it's easy and lots of people do it they come and go mh but uh just to be different different i guess i thought that that would be a good route to take well you definitely are different so are there have you have you come across any other landscapers in your area that are doing what you're doing oh no no most of them oh no kind of they they kind of laugh at me a little bit i think really so when did you get started doing this when did you first do this um well i first started the lawn care part of it in 2014 so it's been a few years okay uh basically just after i had graduated from college okay and then and when you first started were you electric then yep okay so from the very beginning and so um did you know you first customers were they i don't know if i want to go with an electric lawnmower company or or they care i think they initially they just needed their lawn cut right so they didn't really care whether it was gas or electric it made no difference to them as long as the job was done but uh i think one of the advantages was uh that i was able to start originally with electric yeah i think it would be a lot harder for a company who has already invested all the money into the gasoline equipment to be able to switch over so it was kind of an advantage that i was just starting just when it was becoming viable to do it all electric right now you've told me that you probably you're saving money you said that i think what it's a hundred times cheaper to be running your electric um machines than it is to be gas how did you figure that out so i'm using uh kind of generalization calculations okay so if you i'm looking at it on my computer here if you consider a gasoline push mower this is just for push mowers because that's all i use right now okay so if one of those uses a gallon per hour and you can cut about half an acre per hour okay uh with a gasoline mower um i figure that um it takes 400 watts of electricity to cut the same amount okay um so that works out to 3 cents in electricity versus versus $4 in gasoline something that wow so it it is ian it's not one of these things where it's just 2% cheaper or something this is remarkably this is two orders of magnitude cheap to operate yeah just based on the the gasoline versus electricity cost that's off peak cost cuz we have um there's off peak mid peak and on peak costs for our electricity okay so if i would you know i'm working all day so i would plug everything in at night and that would be if i charged everything off of the grid at night and so at night late at night you go off peak y yep awesome now somewhere down the road you got a really cool trailer with some really cool solar panels on it tell me about that is that something you made yourself yep so that was uh just this past winter when i'm kind of off season right have lots of time on my hands i decided that we would try to build uh this solar canopy i guess for the trailer i had the tra we're some pictures of it right now so and is this something you designed yourself yep yeah that was my dad and i we came up with this design it kind of has a a roof a peaked roof that's not really for efficiency at all that's just to be able to um that's just for visibility i guess so people know that when you're looking from the road you can clearly see that it's solar panels right i see if it was just if everything was flat you might not see it mhm so that's kind of a marketing thing that we came up with and i guess yes it is having the peak that is more structurally it's stronger for the structure but uh yeah it worked out we put the frame together and uh the the solar panels are just from canadian tire it's a a department store that we have here okay and uh so they're not any sort of fancy solar panels or anything but the uh the whole system yeah it came together really well and it's been working amazing l well it was sort of an experiment to begin with but uh yeah it's working better than i could have imagined so the solar panels are attached to an inverter i assume yeah so the solar panels each bank so there's 10 up there and each is a bank of five okay they each have a a charge controller and then those charge controllers go into uh two deep cycle lead acid batteries okay just as an either intermediary between the inverter and the charge controllers okay and then from those 12vt batteries it goes to the inverter it's a little bit inefficient it gets inverted from 12vt to 120 mh and then it goes into all the chargers which generally charges at 36 volts gotcha so how much of your power comes from these solar panels now so i think it's between 90 and 95% wow yeah that's amazing that's incredible so basically you leave your stuff you know plugged in in the trailer and the solar panels charge most of it up yep yep so generally when i'm out it's sunny anyway so when it's in direct sunlight there's way too much electricity than i can possibly use everything's charged all the time if it's sunny gotcha w but uh when we have a stretch of a couple days days that are cloudy and i'm if i'm working throughout those days then sometimes i'll have to top up on off of the grid when i get home but other than that yeah it's all solar that's great now you were telling me that you have some clients who actually appreciate the fact that you are electric and you have some clients who don't really even know or care yeah yeah so so what's the advantage all of them all of them love the quiet okay because the tools are so much more quiet than than gasoline tools uhhuh so they all agree on that but some of them again they just want their lawn cut sort of thing they don't really care how it's done they don't care if it's environmentally friendly or not but others that's you know the main reason why they hired me was because i'm using electric equipment so what percentage of your clients do you think hired you because you are electric um right now not very many i don't think maybe 10% okay but uh i think it's a lot of the customers that i have now they've been recommended they're sort of a few steps away from friends or family so it's kind of uh i don't know how to say it but word of mouth kind of yeah yeah so they haven't really researched the company or anything that they just a friend of them just tells them oh this this is who cuts my lawn and they just go with that sort of thing but i'm seeing more and more at since i had the panels put on this year and had the trailer all outfitted with decals and everything i never had that before i never had oh that was okay yeah so this year is the first year with any sort of advertising and since i started doing that people have been starting to call specifically for that reason that's awesome now you um you're mentioning that you can mow someone's lawn you know at 5:00 when it's dinner time and um it doesn't bother anyone cuz it's quiet yeah yeah and then how about you the operator is it better for you um working with these electric machines rather than gas powerered ones uh yeah i think so i don't have to wear ear protection that's the biggest thing so we just we listen to music we have earbuds in and uh it's safe to to be using all this stuff without any ear protection i had one guy actually the other day he stopped he stopped his truck in traffic and was leaning out the window telling me that i should have ear protection in because he didn't know that it was he thought i should have these big ear muffs on i was oh no it's okay it's oh okay that's great um so are you uh a reservation holder for the model 3 is that something that you're lined up for or not or what no i uh i haven't put down any sort of deposit for that if they came out with a with an electric truck that could tow i don't know 10,000 then uh then you're signed up you're good to go yeah then i would sign up but i just bought a brand new truck so might might be a while right okay so i mean we did hear that the tesla semi i mean the tesla pickup truck is coming out um maybe in a couple years so would would that be on the right horizon for you maybe when it when the time came yeah definitely i would definitely consider it that's cool because yeah it's supposed to have a place to plug in you know tools and be able to charge off the big battery so that that could be really um so now have you grown at all since you started in terms of the number of clients oh yeah um so at the very beginning i only had you know it was uh 10 to 20 people and then every year since then it's kind of it's grown definitely this year i have between 50 and 60 regular people wow and there's uh and then there's always kind of people people that just call for just a onetime thing trimming or whatever do you think you might be expanding into getting employees next year well i have someone that helps me has been helping me this year but uh definitely i'll have to you know consider getting another crew maybe soon i'm not sure nice second crew of electric cut i love the sound of that that's awesome now for all those naysayers out there who say that okay well you know electric lawnmowers they're not going to they're not going to cut it um what do you say to them um i say that they should try one themselves i think they would be pleasantly surprised if they were to try one themselves i see as i'm driving around there's lots of people that have that just use them personally right they have tons of different brands to choose from and different styles and stuff so especially with the lithium ion batteries so the ones you're upgrading now are are are lead acid batteries right they're an older model yeah so when i started in back in 2014 that was basically it was it had the most energy so you could go the furthest without uh without recharging um so now let's talk about maintenance of your equipment so when you do when you go to small gas powerered engines i mean my experience has been that there's just constantly something not working a choke isn't working you have to take them apart and fix them what has your experience been with your electric um equipment uh really good i haven't really done a whole lot of maintenance on other than sharpening the blades i mean there's really there's nothing really to do with them and we're talking we're talking this isn't just a homeowner who uses his equipment you know once every couple weeks you're using it every day multiple times a day yeah so these mowers were never intended to to be used to do what you're doing with them yeah and they're working so yeah 50 lawn 50 ls a week uh they were never i think they were intended for maybe one or two a week but wow have you seen any degradation in terms of the power or the um length of battery charge or anything that uh the original battery that was from 2013 it it uh doesn't last quite as long as the brand new ones but it's still i still use it and it still works fine wow but uh the one thing that was kind of funny was uh i into lowe's one day and you know how they have those they have a place to put batteries to be recycled uhhuh so i saw one of my mower batteries there mh uh in the recycle bin so i asked them if i could take it just to see if i could do something with it and they said sure so i took it uh and i opened it up so there's a case that you can open and inside there's three 12vt uh cells i guess guess okay and they're just the uh they're the mobility scooter batteries basically okay so they're they're a standard battery there's millions of them all over the place and they just wire three of them in series to get the 36 volts gotcha and one of them was all bulged and deformed so i knew that you know that must be the problem whoever had it before probably left it out all winter or something that right so i just i took it out i went on amazon bought a new one for 30 bucks and put it back in plug everything back in and it was fine it's been working fine good for you that's awesome so i did a i got you know those batteries are relatively expensive brand new right so i just took them one cello replaced it and it was good to go that's fantastic wow yeah i i'm just so impressed by what you're doing because you had nobody who led the way for you it's not you could have watched someone else's you know youtube or read someone else's book about it you're just i'm going to try it and you've been expanding each each year it seems you've been adding new things you've been adding your solar powered trailer and you've been expanding the number of customers it's just and now you've got decals on your trailer so you're getting more customer this is just really cool to hear about especially since this means that every time you're out there doing a lawn you're emitting no emissions into the atmosphere right yeah that's the uh that's the main goal that's so cool i guess i'm surprised because i thought that you know we down here in the us we we think that you canadians are just so green and i we i kind of thought that all your customers would be because you were electric but it's it's funny to hear that they just want their lawns cut and you can do that um and as long as you can do that they don't care if it's electric or gas yep well in serna um we have a a big oil refinery presence so a lot of uh a lot of the industry here is based around the oil refiner interesting so there's lots of people that you know they drive big trucks and they not saying that i don't but right right some people are less concerned about the environment than others i guess right wow it's just it's just really great to hear about your story and it's really great to get the word out to other people um who are either in your area and can hire you or to other people who might have the same idea who might be on the other side of the world and want to start a company of of whatever type and run it off electricity instead of gas yeah for sure wow well thank you so much for talking to me today and to sharing your story that and and thank you for this awesome drone footage that you got of you at work um this is it's really fun to see you working with these electric tools and to hear that they they really do work year in year out yep thanks for having me all right was so good meeting you mitch you too thanks bye byebye hey guys it's bobby from now you know and thank you so much for watching this episode we loved interviewing mitch from electri cut we've left a link in the descript deson below to his website so you can check out his company and all he does he's really cool he's got a lot of cool things going on so definitely go uh check him out also make sure to for more videos this we do a lot of videos on tesla me and uh my coworker brent do some editing videos so that's pretty fun so yeah make sure you leave a leave a comment thank you mitch now you know woo woo",0
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJl35aIy5pOVBHvoGgqavrdJ,QwhfZvTmCqI,"hey everybody i'm zack and i'm jesse and you're watching in depth on now you know [music] sponsored by a better route planner calm in fact i use this when i went camping and then i didn't trust it i didn't believe it and i was oh no i shouldn't use my air-conditioning during the night and then i woke up the next morning and i realized that i could drive all the way home with battery power that i had left oh so it was right it was absolutely right and i was absolutely wrong but i was in the woods and i was scared and brought to you by eco where us now jesse's were in a new t-shirt but this doesn't make sense it says rich free builds on it yeah rich rebuilds is on eco wear nice yeah so go support us and rich rebuilds and you know we plant a tree for every tea even if it's a rich rebuilt t-shirt so what are we talking about this week just so a couple weeks ago bernie released his sixteen point three trillion dollar green new deal so what is it involved so it calls for decarbonizing transportation and power the two largest sources of emissions in the u.s. by 2030 which would lower u.s. emissions by 71 percent yeah the plan says that the cost of doing nothing is far more expensive and this is gonna be paid for by a bunch of things first one is the income tax revenue of the 20 million new jobs created by his plan so that'll make 2.3 trillion dollars in tax revenue then there should be the estimated 1.3 trillion dollars saved through a reduction needed for safety net programs because obviously those people now have jobs there'll be a 1.2 trillion dollar savings from reducing military expenses relating to protecting oil shipping routes don't need to protect the oil anymore because it won't be any and they'll be ending fossil fuel subsidies and instead they'll be taxing that industry that is huge because right now we basically just hand the money every year instead of taxing them and then some more things which are i think pretty cool pursuing criminal prosecution of fossil fuel companies which no one ever seems to want to talk about but they knew things back in the 80s and they kept going with ruining our planet so yeah let's criminally prosecute them complete decarbonisation by 2050 new wind solar and geothermal projects there should be a creation of 20 million jobs in building energy-efficient cars boats energy efficiency retrofitting of homes sustainable agriculture engineering research and development and then at the very end of the green new deal there was one little teeny tiny point oh what what is what what is it father's just three words and it was electric school buses okay why school buses because we can convert them to all-electric so they don't burn diesel anymore but who cares about a few school buses we were just talking about some really big things there well actually there are four hundred and sixty thousand school buses in the united states you might be saying oh but you know regular city buses transit buses there's only a hundred and fifty thousand women there's three times more school buses than city buses yes school buses travel more miles as a fleet than transit buses do and on any given day that school is in session school buses will transport more passengers than all us domestic airlines combined let me get this straight kids on school buses traveling that's more than the number of people traveling on us domestic airplanes going to florida and go into california it's tough yes and according to a statistical characterization of school bus drive cycles collected via onboard logging systems school buses on average only travel 32 miles per day so there is plenty of excess battery capacity because most buses won't use all of it yeah you just said excess battery capacity what are you talking about well if a school bus only has to travel 32 miles a day and still needs to be able to go on a field trip that means you're going to have some excess battery power wait so you're talking about converting all of our existing school buses into electric school buses yes that sounds really hard actually there's a great jalopnik story that talks about how easy it would be to retrofit some of these buses because i mean these are not luxury cars you know they don't have you know really nice wood paneling or you know very fancy plastic handles and stuff that a school bus is basically a metal box with wheels and a motor i mean they are not that complicated i mean they're made out of i beams and sheet metal i mean you're just saying basically slap some batteries and a motor on there and take out the old diesel engine in the other stuff there's so much room underneath the bus mostly just for the exhaust system and just the way that they're manufactured that there is tons of room for batteries and of course you don't need great performance in a bus so the zero to sixty time really doesn't matter so they can be fairly underpowered as long as they can make it up most hills and i guess i mean you could just make a few kind of kits conversion kits because there's only a few different bus types and then basically once you figure it out oh here's the battery kit here's the motor kit connect them together you're good to go right and i mean think about it this way tesla's have a seven or eight year battery warranty okay but as these batteries eventually dip below 70 or 80 percent which is the warranty range degradation they can be recycled into school bus batteries because if they're no good an electric car why would they be good an electric bus well because hey you can pack way more into the electric school bus okay they can be a lot cheaper since they've already been used for the premium you know part of their life which is you know where you're getting the full 100 percent out of the battery once the degradation really kicks in after about seven or eight years but i don't they just trash then no you could use them for either battery storage so you could use them in say a power wall or something that where it doesn't really matter that they don't have the full range or if you pack them onto a bus you know it's not as efficient because the energy density isn't necessarily as good but it doesn't really matter because again it's a school bus so you're still gonna get years of life out of the battery after it's used up its life on a tesla or a leaf or something oh absolutely so yeah you could recycle the batteries out of a tesla either taking just the whole pack out or down to some sub component the cell level if you really needed to that's a really good point because school buses are notoriously top-heavy with lots of you know kids riding high up in the bus and then the really heavy diesel engine which is high up on the bus and so a lot of accidents that happen with school buses are rollovers right now you're talking about slapping batteries onto the lower part of the bus so that you're making the center of gravity lower and so you're going to drastically reduce the number of the most common accidents which are rollovers right and you know any weight you can add to the does make it safer i mean school buses are surprisingly safe especially since most kids don't use seat belt all right now sell me on any other points you have to make me want to do this well i mean we'd have to devote a whole episode to that which we're going to do so i think that one of the first big points here is that there's going to be far less maintenance on an electric school bus then you would have on a diesel school bus okay but give me some numbers don't just say it's been a little less sure so according to the cgi of vt gev school bus working group there would be a four thousand four hundred dollar a year reduction in maintenance costs what every year per bus what yes for every bus that you've converted to electric you're going to be spending four thousand four hundred dollars less on maintenance every year and that's just maintenance i don't understand maintenance on what what how am i saving money so i mean first of all you don't have the diesel engine okay next you have regen braking which means that you don't have to replace the brakes hardly as often so you have huge brake savings okay there's no exhaust system underneath the bus rusting out there's no timing belts no water pumps no head gasket no oil changes no air filters all of the different things that contribute to a high maintenance cost on a diesel bus suddenly gone melt away i mean yes you still have tires and you have windshield wipers on which a wiper fluid but other than that you just plug the thing in and you got to clean up some vomit every now and then okay we save on some maintenance do we save anything on fuel oh yes because school buses are sitting around most of the time basically 22 out of 24 hours a day you can charge them off-peak which will save you even more money so not only does the electric powertrain make them way more efficient but the electricity is cheaper so we're talking about a 75% reduction in fuel costs now there is a big hidden bonus to this plan okay and that is v 2g or vehicle-to-grid so what vehicle-to-grid means is that you can take an electric vehicle your bus and you can plug it into a house or a business or a school and it connects up just a tesla powerwall to the grid so there'll be a computer on board the school buses battery that communicates with the grid and it can either take power out of the battery when that when the grid needs power or it can charge the battery the grid needs to shed some power basically this is doing the job of a peeker plant i don't get it what does this mean pictures solar panels covering the roof of your local school okay now the school bus pulls up in the morning with say 20% left in its battery okay it lets the kids off at 8:30 a.m. and then it stays plugged into the school in the parking lot soaking up all that solar power so if it noon for some reason the grid needs more juice because it's too hot out and a lot of air conditioners have turned on then the buses batteries will give the grid power for a while to even out the load then say at around 2:30 the kids get back on the bus now with about a 60% battery and get driven home so now the buses return to the bus parking lot and they plug in either to give their power or to receive it depending on the grids and the buses needs you know obviously there'd be a computer to make sure that you'd have enough to complete your route right with some margin of error you know that's not hard to program it's not rocket science all right so what did we just make doing all this i don't get it you made a huge mobile battery so all the time it's stabilizing the grid and it's able to store solar and wind energy weight so we've already seen how the horn stell battery in south australia work to stabilize the grid and save money there so this would work just the same except this is a mobile battery these batteries are moving all over the place absolutely so today if your town wanted to install a a battery station it would need to acquire some land to do that you know either it's some parcel that the town doesn't use or they would have to lease or buy something and with this you you know you already have a school bus parking lot because every town kind of needs one whether that be the school or it's off somewhere else that would be your battery station now that's cool and there's another hidden bonus in this okay you know with global climate crisis comes terrible weather events you know floods fires hurricanes tornadoes droughts and school buses are now mobile batteries so you can fill them up with bottled water health supplies food blankets and what do you have a mobile first responder brigade complete with power so basically they can drive to a community in need and then they can supply shelter food water power communities that had their power knocked out and so what you can do now is turn practically any building into a shelter okay because usually you'd have to say okay we're planning ahead right now and this is going to be a shelter so we need to make sure that we have a backup power source some kind of you know generator and we will need to you know make sure that it's stocked with food and water well ahead of the storm or whatever now with your mobile brigade you can pull up to the school or some other building that wasn't really planned to be a shelter make it a shelter wow all the buses use their power to keep that shelter running with all the lights and all of the refrigeration and everything else you might need i love that i mean because you can fill them with supplies i mean that's what they're good at right or fill them with people and get them out you know write whatever you need to do school buses are very useful they're very utilitarian yeah so it seems to me there's another benefit here that we're not talking about which is health there was a study of 61 million people back in 2015 where researchers found that exposure to diesel soot and ground-level ozone created by diesel exhaust was linked to higher rates of mortality and researchers from georgia state university compared the standardized test scores of kids who rode old dirtier diesel buses to those who commuted in buses with engines that had been modified or retrofitted to filter out up to 95 percent of the harmful pollutants and guess what they found out they looked at the test results from 2007 to 2015 and they found a significant increase in english scores and a small but notable gain in math scores among the clean bus riding kids you know i'd be saying okay sure maybe it affects test scores but maybe they just lived in you know rich neighborhoods but keep in mind that it is estimated that children who are bused to school spend up to two thousand hours on board a school bus between grades k through 12 2000 hours whoo thousand hours wow i mean that's the time that they are on the bus wow and get this jimmy o daya a senior vehicles analyst for the union of concerned scientists said the scientific literature is really showing with study after study nearly every organ system in the body is at risk from higher exposure to particulate matter everything from the lung diseases that you might typically associate with bad air quality to heart and neurological diseases are being found to increase health risks from more exposure to these pollutants so on top of all of this replacing all of america's school buses with electric buses could avoid an average of 5.3 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions each year that's just a little icing on the cake right because i mean the stuff that we've been talking about is huge is super important i mean we're talking about big savings for the towns themselves we're talking about health benefits for students we're talking about awesome big battery storage facilities that are on wheels that you can bring places really really cool stuff yeah but you know what i know a lot of you out there are listening right now and you're going ii jesse again with this pie in the sky stuff it's never gonna happen why are you talking about it well it's actually happening right now virginia governor ralph northam he said these buses will be quieter more efficient they are safer they have seat belts now what he's talking about is phase one of a plan that is started with 50 electric buses and this contract goes out to bid next week and the company ceo and president thomas ferrell said that the goal is to have placed 1000 of these new buses electric buses on the roads within five years yes so if virginia wants to replace all their school buses with electric ones by 2030 and here is a really great quote where they are locally in garages and parking lots we can take that electricity back and put it on the grid and that is from thomas farrow they already know that the v2g stuff is going to be cool yeah i mean pharrell referenced a study that found that replacing one diesel bus with an electric model can save a school district $700 a month in gas and maintenance costs $700 a month rename me a school district that couldn't use that money exactly i mean a single school bus gets about six miles to the gallon and create as much carbon monoxide as five cars according to data provided by dominion energy air quality inside the bus is often more harmful than it is outside the bus pharrell said when they sit there the diesel fumes can pour into the bus we can get rid of all that so it's going to be much healthier for the kid and the drivers save the school system money and reduce their carbon footprint it's better for everybody so you know we just went through a bunch of different points and you might have said ozark and jessie i don't know about some of those points here's virginia here is them actually talking about all the points that we just discussed oh and it's not just virginia in july kamala harris bernie sanders and cory booker introduced the clean school bus act in the senate and representative johanna hayes introduced it in the house of representatives so this would authorize up to 1 billion dollars in spending to help districts replace diesel school buses with electric ones so get this children riding to school on buses every year they travel more than 4 billion miles each year according to nitsa and those rides cost nearly 10 billion dollars a year that's according to the national school transportation association so you might be watching at home and saying you know but zach and jesse that's a billion dollars if that bill passes of my hard-earned tax money yeah i mean that's that's what 11 f-35s that we could buy actually it's only about 3 f-35s because you have to put maintenance contracts on them so oh so with the maintenance it's only it's only 3 yeah because the most of the cost is maintenance and fuel and stuff the 1 billion dollars would either get you basically to start electrifying the entire country's bus system or could get you 3 f-35c so you're saying that 460 thousand school buses cost the same as 3 jets so to be fair that's just to get the ball rolling that billion dollars it's gonna cost something $25,000 or so to convert a diesel bus to an electric bus once the economies of scale get going so we're looking at approximately 460 thousand buses times 25 thousand dollars a bus that equals eleven point five billion dollars but keep in mind we're gonna be saving 3 billion dollars a year in fuel and maintenance yeah that's a really good point because if you just look at your upfront cost of leven point five you might be sticker shock don't want to do it right but yeah when you factor in the fuel and maintenance and just that alone it pretty much pays for itself in four years and there are so many other hidden savings you know things that don't show up on the balance sheet but do actually happen in real life for sure yeah i mean you're also getting a mobile battery that in store wind solar and save money by leveling the grid i mean what's that value it's not building a new peaker plant right it's the millions that would have been spent to buy or lease the land to put a mega pack on and it will actually be able to earn its own money right right i mean the horn steel battery pack was able to pay itself off in three years and that's just a battery that sits there it doesn't drive children to school it just sits there it just collects wind and solar energy and distributes it to the grid right it just stabilizes the grid that's all it does you'd be having this on wheels or how about this the disaster relief that we're talking about i mean you would now be able to turn any building into a shelter and let's just put the cost of one major cleanup so if we remind ourselves of what it costs to clean up hurricane katrina that cost one hundred and fourteen point five billion dollars in recovery right so when a when a horrible thing happens we spend a lot of money trying to help and these converted school buses could go a long way to making that happen for people during crises and there's another hidden savings yeah and this one is to meet it's almost insidious so by age 35 every extra iq point you have should on average earn you eight hundred and ten dollars more per year according to the american enterprise institute now research has shown that poor air quality can lead to a decrease in iq which in one study found a decrease of as much as six point six points women so you're saying that the iq points lost by kids riding diesel school buses could mean actual less money that they'd earn well i mean that is if you put you know the earnings of a person just to their iq points that's not to say the you know the enjoyment of their life that's just putting that's just money but i mean you're saying that could earn them five thousand dollars less per year right i mean let's say you have a job that earns you forty five thousand dollars a year now you're making $40,000 wow all because in and it goes the other way does he wrote a bus all because you wrote a bus now that is just the monetary value that we can kind of equate based on iq which is something that we can kind of measure but that doesn't go into you know just your whole life and and the quality of your entire life and that's just iq right i mean we've we've said it many times before on the show you can't put a value on health so i mean keeping the air clean for millions of children who are sitting on buses and waiting at bus stops or standing in school parking lots full of idling diesel buses for thousands of hours during their formidable years is invaluable but if we had to put some kind of price on it we'd look to occupational health studies now these studies are of railroad dock trucking and bus garage workers who are exposed to high levels of diesel exhaust over many years which consistently demonstrate a twenty to fifty percent increase in the risk of lung cancer or mortality and so it's important to keep in mind that if we are talking about four hundred and sixty thousand buses we're also talking about at least four hundred and sixty thousand bus drivers true i mean we're talking about bus drivers who we're gonna be driving the bus longer than the kids are going to school you know the twelve years of schooling or thirteen years of schooling that the kids are going to beget um but again those are adults driving the bus those are not little children those are not kindergarten aged children that are going to be getting on this bus this diesel bus and then getting out of the bus walking right past the tailpipe on their way to school every single day now i think we've laid out a pretty good argument for doing this but i still know that there's a lot of people out there who are gonna say you know what though this bernie plan is gonna cost a billion dollars or if we do the whole plan it's gonna cost trillions of dollars to make and i think a lot of people immediately turn off whenever you talk about the government spending money to solve a problem right they just immediately i'm not spending my hard-earned tax money on that and i think the problem comes from this we were never taught in school how government works well i mean there's the legislative branch the judicial branch and there's the executive branch sure they all have checks and balances on each other and the constitution and the bill of rights and well let me ask you this uh-huh if you go to a hardware store and you get the wrong color paint when you get home because they mixed it wrong what do you do i drive right back to the hardware store i give them the paint and i say this paint is the wrong color this is ridiculous i demand a refund and i i want the right color paint okay and that gets taken care of right absolutely okay what happens when you get out of college you've had all this great education right and your city or town or your state is doing something you don't i would complain to my friends good i would complain to my family uh-huh i might write something on facebook okay i thought you were taught all about government in school what why don't why don't you know what to do um there's a isn't there government working for you they don't they take your tax dollars and bill um just the bill you see where i'm going with this we don't know what to do so we get angry every year that goes by in our lives we get angrier and angrier at this government that we don't know how it works we don't know how to interact with it we might write them a hateful letter we might show up at a meeting and yell at somebody but we don't know how to actually get anything done i mean the only interaction that you have with the government if you're a law abiding citizen is your taxes i mean that's just about it i mean you i mean it's it's what the library and school and taxes but i mean taxes what is what you're gonna be doing the most don't do it everyday i mean when you buy something you're paying taxes right at the end of the year you're paying your taxes you're always paying taxes and i know you get any upsets i pay all this money to you guys but you never listen to me right and so when you hear someone bernie say you would to spend some money to fix a problem you go oh yeah you want to spend my money on something you don't listen to what i want and i get that and that's part of this problem is we have a lot of angry people out there this money's gonna get spent one way or the other it's not we're not gonna have a government right we have a government that spends trillions of dollars so whether you hear about the bill or you don't there's trillions of dollars being spent as we speak right but you hear about this one bill and this billion dollars and it sticks in your craw and you're i'm upset about spending this money on this thing but let's let's take another look at this mhm you know some kids right maybe you got grandkids or kids yourself or your nieces and nephews or those kids down the street well i mean let's forget about kids for a second electric buses will lower your electricity bill they'll actually lower you taxes i mean think about this for a second what happens during the summer kids aren't going to school the buses are sitting there all day long in the summer right and so their basic you know what's happening to the diesel buses right there they're just degrading they're just resting that is falling into nothing if they were hooked up to the grid and they were able to capture all of the summer sunshine and charge it up during the day and distribute it during the night there you go your town could very easily become its own power exactly you've got all these town buildings schools municipal buildings garages which could be covered with solar panels and putting all that solar energy into mobile batteries and now you don't have to pay a utility company for your electricity you can your town can it's very easily as soon as they have these electric buses just say okay we're gonna become our own utility we have the infrastructure maybe we need to you know build a couple more batteries but these buses really have a big chunk of energy storage right here and we could probably do it and you might be saying well zack and jesse that's crazy i've never heard of any municipality owning their own power company but lots of them do right my friend has an electricity bill of six cents per kilowatt hour i on the other hand have an electric bill of 22 cents per kilowatt hour and we live about 15 miles apart it's his municipality that is giving him that insane insane benefit and if you have an electric car we were doing the math he could have paid for a model 3 with the amount of savings that he would have gone from his gas burning truck to a model 3 he would have been able to pay just with the gas savings alone he would have been able to pay for that car that is what we're talking about the you know and and that is just your electric bill right we're not getting to the taxes because electric buses are cheaper to maintain and they're cheaper to fuel it's just that simple and this is just the tip of the iceberg this is just one little piece of that plan one little idea that if you really think about it saves so much money and makes so much sense but yet our media doesn't delve into this you don't hear stories about it why because there's not people yelling at each other that's what they want it the story is all about keeping people angry to each other they don't want you solving problems and that's what we need to switch to is a system where we're just talking to one another and coming up with great solutions wouldn't that be a much better place to live in than a world where we're just yelling at each other all the time about you're wrong and in a place where we're fumigating our students as they get on the bus yeah i mean it should be a no-brainer it should be democrats republicans libertarians shouldn't matter this plan makes sense across the aisle and across countries anyway i hope it makes sense to you if it does contact your local school committee's contact your local representatives and tell them hey i want electric school buses and you know what if you're thinking about presidential candidates we don't care who you vote for but make sure that the candidate you're voting for is onboard with stuff this so when they come to your town and they start saying hey can i have your vote say well let me wait hey that hang on a second have you heard about converting to electric school buses cuz the person who does that is got my vote right and if they hear that from enough people they'll go what what's this thing about electric school buses right add that to my plan anyway we hope you really enjoyed this if you liked it hit the button again i don't know if that has any bearing on anything but but you know what it does have bret i do see the number it makes you to vote makes me feel good well the other thing is that's how we as youtubers grow our and by growing our we get out to more people and we get our ideas and our thoughts out to more so when you it's free to do and it really does help us grow maybe hit the button yep thanks so much for joining us guys we'll see you next week nine-nine",0
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJl35aIy5pOVBHvoGgqavrdJ,PqdB93lCqHc,remember austin meyer the guy who's giving away a million dollars in electric school buses in this he reveals the underbelly of the u.s patent system it all ties into why tesla gives away their patents now you'll need to be a little savvy here and read between the lines it's really awesome you should definitely check it out i'm zach

buses he's going to be letting you in on a problem that happened to him austin got sued for patent infringement and he didn't just whine about it to us he made a full length feature documentary called the patent scam which we urge you to watch we'll put the link down below now i had heard about patent trolls but i didn't understand how they operated until i watched austin's amazing documentary you're about to hear firsthand how broken our u.s patent system is from a guy who spent millions of dollars fighting a bogus patent lawsuit himself patents and intellectual property are the cornerstone of innovation or at least i thought they were if you have a broken patent system how can we expect companies tesla to innovate all right well i'm so lucky today to have with us austin meyer now you may remember austin because he did that incredible thing where he gave a million dollars away in electric school buses but we're not here today to talk to him about that we're actually here to talk to him about something completely different so when i was doing a little research on austin before about the electric school buses i went to his website and i saw that he was in this movie called the patent scam and i thought oh he's got a little bit part that he does in the patent scam maybe i'll put that on my to-do list my watch list and then i looked at imdb and it said that it gets 7.5 stars if you know anything about imdb you know that 7.5 stars is almost impossible to get on imdb so i was this must be really good so i bumped it up to the top of my list watched the movie and my head fell off and i think i called you soon after that and then you watched the movie and uh yeah because the one thing that you haven't mentioned was that uh austin meyer was not just a small actor in the movie or a small part in the movie wrote directed produced you you made the movie austin right so here's the name of the game um x-plane is my flight simulator i put it on the app store the google app store and the way the google app store works is anybody can download an application and then if they buy it then the server tells the little you know phone oh this guy bought x-plane you can unlock it and go flying okay that's the way the google online store works all the apps work this way well someone called a patent troll which is someone that writes patents to describe vague general ideas then sue people that execute on that idea uh someone claimed to own the idea of one computer uh allowing access to software on a different computer and there's one sentence one sentence in the patent said and i own the idea of one computer allowing access to software on a different computer and because he wrote this little sentence down on a piece of paper and by the way many people wrote similar sentences on pieces of paper he by no no means did he have anything to do with google or invent the google play store he uh started suing many people including me and the creator of minecraft by the way for using the google play store because he claimed the google play store was his idea and when he sued us uh they they asked i give him fifty thousand dollars in cash uh to go away and sign a non-disclosure agreement to promise you know to never tell anyone what happened and i was so mad about this i said well he wants me to give him 50 000 in cash leave the patent alone and sign an agreement promising i'll never say what happened what is the worst thing i can do to this guy what's the worst thing i can possibly do and and get away with it or be legal and the answer is i can overturn the patent not given the money and make a documentary movie about him and so that's what i did i wanted to do the exact opposite of what he wanted and so that's why i wrote the patent scam i mean i i conceived it wrote it start it funded it and and everything else now before you do anything else dear viewer stop this and go watch the patent scam we're going to put links down below so you can find it because i'm telling you you're going to not only enjoy it but also your head is going to fall off as well but i do have a question here austin you just said that someone can write in a patent that they have an idea for something and then they can sue you but i'm sorry it can't possibly be true that that's how the patent system works because you can't just say i have this idea for uploading to google and therefore i'm the inventor of it so let me just ask so this guy who sued you he works for google no he had nothing to do with google i don't even think google had ever even heard of him before i went to google and said hey this guy's suing me can you guys help defend me you know you know help help me with my defense fees and google was no we don't really help with defense fees we can't really be involved in this thanks thanks anyway so they had never heard of him and had no part in this lawsuit wait so okay okay so i'm just processing this information so this guy doesn't work for google didn't write the play store didn't so i mean the the google play store is what is using is that's where the code lives right correct the google play store has the concept and the code of saying if a person buys a thing then the computer will unlock software it'll say you bought it i'll unlock it that's what the google play store does and it does through of course hundreds of thousands of lines of code millions you know of hours and and ultimately billions of dollars in the whole e-commerce system designing and building and testing and deploying and supporting you know this whole system which are all the incredible things that google did to make the google play store possible and of course apple did an incredibly you know amazing and equally incredible job with the app store maybe even a better job with the app store what the patent troll does is he writes down a sentence saying a computer unlocking software on another computer i thought of the idea okay but wait wait no no no so it's got it i mean it's a patent right so he this patent must have the code in it must have source no patent ever has code you need to remember what patents are actually used for patents are not used to share information patents are used to blockade competition and so when you write a patent you never ever put anything useful in the patent because if you put anything useful in the patent you would be sharing your secrets which is the last thing you want to do instead what you want to do is make sure nobody can compete with you and so you file the patent with vague general terms that cover as many things as possible so that nobody can do the thing you wrote down in the patent and that blockades competition now if all that was happening is trolls were starting up stores writing down patents to blockade competition then what you would have is anti-competitive behavior or uh monopolies as it's called and that would be bad however all things that are pushed way past any sort of rational limit now we're to the point where trolls they don't even do the business they just do the patent and what they do is they form a fake shell company which is no more than a post-it note on an abandoned office building with absolutely nobody there i know i've been to these buildings myself it's in the movie but um they form this the fake company and then they send in the the patent which just has a vague general sentence and now they're primed to file the lawsuits against anyone that actually does the work that is similar to the vague statement they move in their patents so it's just an excuse for serial filing of unlimited lawsuits but hang on you have a company called x-plane where you actually invent a lot of stuff but they weren't suing you about that they were suing you about uploading it on the play store which i'm sorry don't thousands and bazillions of people do that every day yes absolutely and so the reason they sued us for using the google play store is they could sue a lot of people at once for example the guy that filed this lawsuit i seriously don't think he knows a flight simulator from a hole in the ground okay i don't even believe that he would be competent to say what i do in x-plane and i don't even think he could describe it in words and and file it with a patent office but he knows to say oh well the google play store you know they they they exchange information between computers to unlock software and she writes down that vague sentence that sets him up to sue everyone now i'm going to tell you what's really interesting uh so this guy sued about a dozen people or so all at the same time you know that way he gets a dozen possible people that'll settle with him for only one lawsuit he actually has to go to the trouble to write one of those defendants was notch the creator of minecraft so i sued alongside minecraft during the lawsuit microsoft acquired minecraft and so i was being sued alongside microsoft and microsoft and i were named as defendants in the same lawsuit during this process i overturned the patent and made a documentary movie to tell you what i'm telling you now microsoft rolled over gave them money and signed a non-disclosure agreement microsoft did not defend themselves against a patent troll i did i'm not exaggerating in any way that is exactly what happened now you might be saying well wait a minute microsoft has more resources than austin meyer why is it austin meyer can overturn the patent make a documentary expose the whole thing while microsoft just kind of signs a non-disclosure agreement make sure nobody finds out what happened send the money and just go walking away from it it never happened and then the question i want to ask you is where does microsoft get its value why is the mic why is a share in microsoft so valuable do you know but wait wait we have to go back we have to go back i'm so confused so this is we have to go back to the lawsuit here so there's a guy he has a patent on a and it says that he can control a computer that can grant access to software he didn't say he could control it he said he had the idea of somebody controlling it maybe he made a mistake maybe he should have been suing google right because they owned the play store right so why didn't he just sue google why is he why is he going after you well i don't know if i can tell you why another person did a thing they do but i can tell you that he expected the small businesses he sued to roll over and settle and i can say this because they sent out the settlement agreements to us he sued smaller businesses now let me tell you the cost to defend a patent troll lawsuit all the way through trial is three million dollars it's not i didn't it's not a slip of the tongue or a factual error it takes three million dollars to defend yourself against a patent infringement lawsuit and the patent again that was used against me was one sentence it was a computer accessing data on another computer to unlock software i'm not paraphrasing it that's basically exactly what it was one sentence and it's three million dollars and it normally runs about three to five years to defend against these types of lawsuits for this reason almost everyone settles and so patent trolls historically they sue a lot of small businesses that are not gonna be able to defend themselves and they rack up the settlements then once they get rack up those settlements from the small businesses then they go big game hunting now they go after the big companies and they say now i'm up in the hundreds of millions of dollars of damages because you stole my idea and my idea has already been proven valid we already know it's valid because look at the small guys that decided to pay their licensing fees and since the small businesses paid their licensing fees now it's time for apple google and microsoft to pay up they often have the small guys first to build credibility and then they go big game hunting after that they're the so they they're suing for patent infringement because they called you up and they said austin you're infringing on my patent and you should pay me a licensing they never call they never call you when you're sued by patent troll you don't actually know who's suing you they never call you and they never communicate with you you only receive the lawsuit and your only point of communication is a lawyer so i was work that represents them so i was working at a trade show in wisconsin selling x-plane my cell phone rings and it's a lawyer saying hey i noticed you've been sued for patent infringement you know maybe you'd to hire me to represent you in this lawsuit my statement was i've never filed a patent i've never defended a patent i've never looked at a patent i can't be sued for patent infringement you got the wrong guy and he said nope nope i don't have the wrong guy don't worry you'll be getting the summons soon enough and then sure enough i get home from the trade show still caught getting caught up in sleep someone's bang on door at five a.m and it's a cop delivering the summons so you said that they call you up i wish they would call me up no personal communication is never possible you find out you're sued when the summons show up and the lawyers start knocking on your door okay so there's a summons and it's a because there's a suit that they're gonna sue you they are suing me at this point by the time you heard about it the suit's already been filed okay so there's uh they're suing you in court which means that there's a court and that means that there's a judge and it and we have perfect this seems it gets resolved there right because we have a judicial system in this country there are judges they are supposed to be judges which are you should have called me austin because i'm not even a lawyer and i know that all you had to do was file i forget what it's called but dismissal yeah dismissal emotions are dismissed and then a judge looks at it and goes oh yeah this is ridiculous and he throws it out why don't you do that that's how the judicial system works austin well you must have gone through the wrong process you must talk to the wrong lawyers in in the eastern district of texas which is where all of these lawsuits were filed at the time and it spread out a bit more now at the time as the eastern district of texas um the judges are the fathers of the patent attorneys so uh judge uh leonard davis as i was seemed to recall of his name and other or bo davis and leonard johnson's that i don't remember their names anymore but the judges were the fathers of the patent attorneys and each judge heard the other judge's son in court to avoid a perceived conflict of interest and um so as long as the lawsuits were brought into the eastern district of texas the money was flowing into the the families of the uh judges and i should point out that in these lawsuits no defendant and no actual plaintiff was ever from the eastern district of texas it was always a post office box or an abandoned office building in the eastern district of texas the actual plaintiff in my case was in australia and typically they're in new york and florida and california and they use these abandoned office buildings in texas to establish venue and the judges have allowed venue transfer to where the plaintiffs are actually located or where the defendants are actually located zero times the judges would not throw out the case and even if all the defendants were in california they would not allow the lawsuit to move to california once you're sued in the eastern district of texas the judges were the fathers of the lawyers the venue transfers out were always denied and the summary dismissals were never granted this happened historically i'm not predicting the future based on ire or annoyance i'm recording or i'm in recounting historical occurrences well speaking of historical you must be talking about the 1800s or something that how could this happen in this century this okay so wait this was just a pilot for your hbo show about this fictional thing that you're talking about this can't possibly be real you're saying eastern district of texas we're talking dallas no one of the characteristics of this venue is there's no major airports there um it is the perfect place where it's almost impossible to defend yourself it's just it's kind of near louisiana it's it's eastern district of texas it's far many many hours by car away from any major airport and so once you're sued there it's almost impossible to defend yourself you wind up having to hire lawyers that are possibly the sons of the judges to defend you and um turns out they're actually not that cheap and you have to find a way to get these little kind of perverted little towns of mayberry in the middle of nowhere with tumbleweeds blowing through you couldn't even get there to a major airport i mean literally the fact that i had a small little one propeller airplane that lets me go anywhere is is literally one of the only ways i could get to this place i mean if you're watching this now and you're this sounds insane you have to stop i said and watch the movie because you will see austin fly there and you will see what happens and it's so important to the story to understand the whole story we're acting this is crazy because we have already seen the movie i have seen that movie and i still think it's it's freaking crazy um okay okay okay wait wait so let me just but the other thing is you're not the only one this happened to in the movie we see a whole bunch of other very intelligent uh business people who started businesses who got sued and basically this could have put them out of business and in some people some cases it did um some of these people are under non-disclosure agreement um but in some cases i was able to find out uh what happened even so and some people actually were put out of business but they weren't allowed to say that they were put out of business um but you'll see that not all of these uh the people in the movie have businesses right now some of them were were forced to fold up and you know it is it's it's your electric school bus you talk about iq being lowered it's a clinical thing it's not a clinical thing it's a fundamental terror to our culture that we would drown ourselves in pollution and lower iq and we talk about oh a business being shut down by a patent trolling lawsuit that's that's another clinical description it doesn't do justice so it's really happening what's really happening is someone's empowerment and freedom and creativity and productivity is being ripped out from under them with um what i would call an extortion that we're not allowed to call an extortion because anybody is allowed to file a lawsuit in america but this goes back to patents and i guess my misunderstanding of them i thought there was a patent clerk who when you filed your patent didn't just stamp it also had to look to see if it made any sense common sense for instance there was a patent that came up in your movie which is i think someone patented swinging sideways on a swing and that doesn't make any sense common sense would say you can't patent that but it got patented i mean aren't there some principles for a patent it has to be a novel it has to be useful it has to be uh not obvious um uh some of these that were you talk about in your movie are all of the things the opposite of everything didn't i see a patent in your movie of a stick for a dog to fetch to fetch that's what the so here's what happens uh everything jesse said about a patenting unique and new and non-obvious yeah that's probably all written down somewhere it has nothing to do with what actually happens let me tell you what actually happens okay whenever you file a patent the patent examiner gets his patent and he is supposed to tell you whether anyone has ever written invented anything this before you know you know when he gets a patent for say well hey let's use my case no let's use the swing on a swing sideways case he gets a patent for swinging on a swing sideways what he actually has to do or what he actually does to determine whether or not the patent is valid is see whether that thing has ever been patented before okay so let me back out just a little bit more they're supposed to be able to tell you whether an idea is new the only way they have to decide if an idea is new is to see if it has been patented before if it has not been patented before they say it must not have been thought of before this is because they are in the office at the patent office they have no access or connection to the real world they don't work in private industry and apparently when it comes to swinging on swings and fetching sticks they don't go to the park either they just sit there in their office and their only access to information is previous patents now here's a simple thought experiment if a patent comes into the office and it has never been patented before and the test for whether or not something has ever been thought of before is whether they can find a patent that describes it is everything in the world going to be patented okay so i get that someone one day might have gotten this bright idea to patent these crazy things and go after people but uh in your movie i learned that there's a company on the nasdaq a big giant corporation that buys up these bogus patents and then goes and sues people you and that is their business model the marathon patent group i don't know if they're still in business maybe they've been finally shut down but yeah the marathon patent group would do that i think they call themselves marathon to make sure that everybody they sue knows they're not going to stop they're not going to give up and you just better settle because otherwise you're they're in it for the long haul so um yes people will buy up these patents they call themselves intellectual property firms or intellectual property accretion firms or something that but they buy up patents and then use the patents to sue people and here's where it really gets kind of annoying uh university of southern california for example the the university puts out the patents well once they got the patents then the shareholders or the board or whoever to start saying you know we need to get some money from these patents what do we do and someone comes along and says i can monetize your patent and then the troll buys a patent from the university of uh california and then starts using it to file lawsuits against people including of course graduates from ucsd so um patents are often not always but they're often created in good faith but then acquired by a troll and then used as ammunition later but increasingly though today patents they're not even created in good faith they are created to blockade competition initially and now they're created to be used by patent trolls and here's how you can tell in the patent that uh that was used to sue me it had this sentence about a computer accessing another computer to unlock you know uh information on a piece of software i overturned the patent okay over the course of about five years and it was a joint defense group there were seven of us still in we spent i don't know worth of maybe a million and a half bucks or something that and we overturned this one sentence and the patent troll's response was oh sure you overturned claim seven but now we think you've infringed on claim 117 and 35 and i'm what and i go look at the patent they'd said almost exactly the same thing 135 times it was a computer accessing another computer to unlock software next claim a computer unlocking software by accessing another computer next claim multi-computers talking to each other unlocking software they just phrased this they said the same thing 135 times or so and that way it's designing a battleship that can't be sunk right how do you design a battleship that can't be sunk you make it compartmentalized so you take out any one compartment and it doesn't sink the whole ship trolls design patents the same way say the same thing 130 times so you can keep people in court forever but i mean that's why we're talking to you now on the disruptive investing because to disrupt means you have to innovate and to innovate we have the system in the world called patents where that's gives you the incentive to you know i thought i mean this is what i'm saying i'm thinking this is how it works that you patent something so that now you have some breathing room to go and to work out how to make it work and if you it gives you that incentive so that if you do make it work you can profit from it that's why i thought it was supposed to work because i mean patent office has been around since the 1700s so i thought it was a great thing but now you're telling me this seems it's stopping innovation so what's the what's the answer here because i mean what you're talking about is actually legal to do right um so if it was up to me there would be no patent system and if you wanted to protect your idea you would hold us into trade secret right the source code explain what is it it's a trade secret i don't publish it i did all the work and i keep it secret i don't share it with anyone so trade secrets are where actual value is patents are what we use to blockade competition let's look at apple computer okay apple computer do they publish their source code do they put the source code to the operating system you know out into the world where anybody can use it so everybody can make better operating systems in the future no way it's a secret apple's never going to share their source code it's a trade secret they'd never share it however apple files patents constantly they're constantly filing patents a recent patent they filed was for a paper bag you might not believe me google it apple files patent for paper bag they actually did it and it's only one of countless patents and when you start looking at apple's patents they're all the same thing it's always something a phone that you know prevents itself from breaking when it falls or a bag that's made from recycled material it's just all these vague ideas that aren't really new ideas at all but the actual value of apple computer which is the source code and the operating system they keep all that secret they don't share it and so the patent system is not being used to further inventiveness the patent system is being used to make sure they can stop anyone from competing with them at any time so is this just a problem it's just is it that the patent office as a concept is outdated was it that it was you know because it's hard to keep a steam engine uh a trade secret because you're gonna be strapping it to the outside of a train or something that and and so if i you know jeremiah steam engine invented the steam engine and i wanted to to protect my intellectual property of inventing that physical thing that i am making and producing and selling to the to the you know the railroad company um that would be i would need some some kind of protection for something that i can't keep secret myself so i can understand where a patent might come into play there but when we're talking about computer code you i mean you were saying that that patents don't ever contain any computer code so there's no it it will remain trade secret unless you get access to the source code right unless you hack somebody so as we move into today's uh world a tremendous fraction of the productivity we do is based on computer code algorithms social credit identity reputation um crowdsourcing these are the things that are driving innovation the steam engine's been done and so what patents are so commonly doing is claiming to own a vague general idea and then suing anyone that acts on that vague general idea and specifically the software patents let me answer your question a little more specifically with software patents people file a patent claiming to own the idea embodied by from some computer software but how easy is it to have an idea that a computer should unlock software compared to actually doing it where's the real value you know i have an idea you guys should do a mission to mars there we go i had the idea and if you do it you're going to be hearing from my lawyer because i'm the one that thought of it how does that sound to you that is exactly how it sounds to me in other computer programmers when people file software patents they claim to have an idea to do a thing but they don't actually do it they just do the person that did do it and that way they get to share in their profits and i think each person has to decide for themselves how to interpret that statement now i've been hearing about patent trolling for years i didn't really fully understand it until your movie and then i started to question why haven't i understood it why hasn't there been more media coverage of this and my only thought was it's a pretty complicated issue you did a fantastic job in the movie of breaking it down so i could understand it as a layperson but is that why we haven't heard more about this in the media it's not because it's too complicated it isn't that complicated so i i'm gonna hypothesize that the conservative media and the liberal media they each have decided who's the good guy and who's the bad guy and you decide for yourself who that is you decide who fox news says is the good guy and who fox news says is the bad guy you decide for yourself who cnn says is a good good guy and who cnn says is the bad guy the conservative and the liberal media they've each got their idea of the person they want to glorify and the person they want to vilify well here's my question where do small business entrepreneurs fit into that little rage game that the media has got going on where does an entrepreneur getting sued out of starting a small business fit into that doesn't it's just not part of the game they play and so it just doesn't get covered wait so you're saying that it's your you think that it's in this middle ground i mean there's obviously some extra added layers of complication because some people are signing ndas but i mean plenty of people that you even interviewed didn't and were fighting active lawsuits and stuff that so it seems if the media wanted to they could interview those people so i mean i guess that argument goes out the window so you're saying that basically what people think about small business or or just entrepreneurs in general is so just in the middle of i wouldn't say in the middle the way i would phrase it is it's not the perfect income based or nationality-based or based bait that the mainstream media seems to me to feed on instead it's the conservative media they decided who would they want to be the victim the liberal media has decided who they want to be the victim neither of them has decided that small business entrepreneurs are the ones they want to cover they're not the ones that are that are getting the clicks and so why cover the story they're they they don't seem incentivized maybe it's because this is such a one-sided story they can't come up with an opposing viewpoint to keep the conflict going maybe they if they don't want to see a problem expose the solution and solve it because there's not as many clicks in it maybe they just want to keep the whole conflict uh brewing and so they pick they pick things to cover that are based on race or income or inequality or nationality all the really hot button topics i think that's just what gets the clicks on the websites because i think most people would kind of agree that patent trolling when when the the patent owner isn't even trying to make that technology work or that technology uh in air quotes work it wouldn't be much of a story it'd be oh well that person's a jerk we should do something about it and to just know well i disagree with you bob i think that that person's doing the right thing but to that point it is so obvious to me at least that this should be solved and in your movie you talk about how in congress it got to the point where there was a bill and didn't get out of the senate largely because i think trial lawyers said uh we kind of this i mean this means a lot of work for lawyers so let's just keep this going yep so it was harry reid specifically harry reid made as soon as he saw that reform to this system was starting to bubble the top it would happen harry reid said he would let the idea be discussed over his dead body he would not let the idea be discussed in others it could not be brought up in congress and debated and i am told and i believed it based on plethora of evidence that uh it's because harry reid and other people on his side of the aisle are largely supported by trial lawyers so there seems to be this concept on the left i think that is more oriented around saying we get justice through court or we get justice through the government that's not automatically a bad thing okay that may be a good thing but if it's taken too far then you get to people saying hey i've got an idea and then somebody else went did all the work i still want money for having the idea and then they start taking the money even though they never really made any sort of contribution and so it's just it's a good idea maybe taken to too much of an extreme or something that can i go back to um when these patent trolls come at you it's an episode of sopranos to me it's where uh you know tony soprano says hey you're gonna pay me some some money so we don't have an accident here and then if you pay him the money there's no incentive for him to stop asking for money and so as you pointed out in the movie if you give in and you say fine i'll sign the ndaa here's your check they can just keep coming at you and in fact some people you interviewed they did keep coming after them right so companies on that would settle with the trolls and give them money what they found out is that once they issued the settlement five more trolls would come knocking and um it took them quite some time to finally figure out they had to finally stand up to the troll to stop just the ongoing tax so okay but i just i want to get to the to this point here so there's the there's the court and the court uh you know you're being sued in the court it seems everyone that you interviewed either settled or they were fighting it in court what if you just did nothing i mean what if you just said this is a scam i'm not gonna i'm not gonna bow down to you in court any anyone any reasonable person who isn't corrupt should throw this out um go go go to hell why don't you why doesn't anyone say that people post that as the comments on my youtube videos about patent trolling constantly they all say the same thing that's bull i shouldn't do anything i would just ignore it okay if you ignore it then the troll gets what's called summary judgment which is where he goes to the judge says this guy never answered he never answered me and i've endured a million dollars of damages and now he won't even you know answer my complaint at that point he gets summary judgment and the judge awards for the plaintiff now you've got a patent troll that sues people for a living with a million dollar judgment against you now it becomes a different question can he enact the judgment what can he do can he take your house well i tell you one thing i bet he would do he'd go to google with that judgment and say hey google stop paying austin meyer for x-plane pay us instead here's our judgment it's called garnishing wages and so when you ignore uh and this happens also outside of patent trolling sometimes people ignore lawsuits because they think well if i just put my fingers in my ears it'll go away well yeah you can ignore it until the person that sued you gets a summary judgment the summary judgment is always the largest number the plaintiff could ask for and now they're going to start garnishing your wages and repossessing whatever you have so the putting your fingers in your ears doesn't work uh if you have any thing in your life that has financial value and all these people do because those were they were targeted that's why they were targeted they were targeted because they have enough money to be a juicy target but probably not enough money to defend themselves so i mean can't you couldn't you appeal the judgment couldn't you have just not fought and then appeal the judgment and say this was based on fraudulent this is a bull now we're starting to ask the question can does the appeal happen in the eastern district of texas and is can you appeal a case because you never bothered to defend against it those are two pretty shaky arguments i wouldn't want to bet my business on those so tell me at this point in the interview that something's getting better i mean i gotta believe this is america i gotta believe that something's getting better i have two solutions already oh jesse solving austin i wanna run these by you okay number one i have i have a business uh proposition um which is that so usually they'd be coming after you know fifty thousand to three hundred thousand dollars for the quote-unquote licensing fee extortion i'm gonna come to you austin you pay me thirty thousand dollars i have a conversation with the plaintiff and uh we we will come to some amicable agreement that doesn't involve you um don't worry i'm gonna i'm gonna take care of it you know what i'm saying what huh that's the thought that goes through everyone's mind including mine every single person that is sued by a troll or has heard about patent trolling that is exactly what they think they think first i'll ignore it and then i'll defend myself by shall we say certain undisclosed means but this is always type thing you want to talk about never the type of thing you can actually do or you actually want to do and we get dragged back into the real world where we're looking at a bank statement an income stream a company and someone that's going to take out a lien and claim to own all of those things if you don't play their game then all right here's my second one you patent extortion and sue them for patent infringement all the i get that comment all the time jessie people leave that comment all the time on my uh youtube videos and unfortunately they don't have any assets right remember what they are you are suing a company what is this company it is an abandoned office in texas with a post-it note there are no assets there is nothing to collect and if you sued them in the eastern district of texas that would be the one lawsuit that's thrown out if you sue them in your own jurisdiction um there are there is nothing to collect because they make sure that the shell remember the whole reason they cannot be attacked is because they have nothing to attack it's an empty office with a post-it note on the door and the moment the settlement money comes in it goes out of the company and into the pockets of the actual trolls so wait you won the lawsuit right and doesn't the opposing turned the patent i overturned the patent uh the judge perhaps not surprisingly never held the troll accountable though he never had the troll paid legal fees or anything that and so i spent much much more defending the lawsuit than i would have if i just given him the 50 grand wow what if you did win the lawsuit what if you went to court and you proved and then then you could collect all your money back your lawyer fees right well i would i would have to actually he would have to counter sue yeah i'd have to counter sue and then my cause of action my cause of action my countersue would be they sued me without justification well in america you can't sue somebody for suing you without justification because what is the lawsuit it's asking the question does this guy owe me money you can't sue somebody for asking that question so i ironically i'm actually the guy that does not have a cause of action here because you can't sue someone for suing you the most you could do is ask for your legal fees but in the eastern district of texas under these judges they never awarded legal fees and they never let you leave the the venue and so we knew that that would be an absolute waste of time and and in my case indeed the judge said no i don't get to collect legal fees okay so congress has done nothing so far tell me that there's some good news is anything changed yeah so a little something has changed shortly after i came out with the documentary uh the supreme court ruled that if you sue someone for patent infringement you need to sue them where they live you don't sue them in eastern district of texas so the problem has been shall we say mitigated by uh by the supreme court ruling it still happens but now what we have is uh patently takes a slightly different form it's what we call big game hunting and this is where the patent trolls sue google and apple uh in california you see they sue the big companies and then it becomes a question for the big company do they want to be painted as a bad guy do they want to take a risk and do they want to do anything to to destabilize the patent system because remember apple and google they don't want the patent system destabilized right this is how they maintain their ex well maybe i shouldn't go so far as to say that i believe it is one of the ways they maintain their exclusivity by owning patents on things to stop other people from being able to do the same thing so let me say that that is what i believe to be the case based on my understanding and you notice i'm being really really careful because i don't want to land myself uh in hot water with the tech giant and and say anything that might be considered as you know libelous but i mean don't they have a trade secret source code oh yeah oh google apple microsoft they have tremendous trade secrets tremendous source code and it's absolutely what they run their business on which is a wonderful thing it's a beautiful thing it's a perfect thing but where i think things go off the rails is then the apple takes out a patent on a paper bag made out of recycled paper and now if anyone else tries to compete with apple i can't tell you what apple would do okay but i can tell you what apple has positioned themselves to be able to do what they want and that is sue anyone that competes with them blockade competition now maybe i've got it all wrong maybe apple would never actually sue anyone for patent infringement okay maybe i'm just being suspicious here but i can promise you apple is constantly patenting all of these vague general ideas and i don't see a whole lot of competition against apple i'm still using a mac os that's basically unchanged for the last 15 years so what's the toll of the troll what does patent trolling really doing you know it used to be it would destroy small businesses by kneecapping now what it's doing is it's acting as a tax everything we buy from a big tech company is taxed with settlements going out to patent trolls and that's a little bit of an annoying but nobody really cares if apple or google has to pay money or microsoft has to pay money and that includes me i don't care if they have to pay money but i think we all know they're just going to pass that expense on to us but the real fear that i have is what if there has actually been an elon musk of operating systems that would have competed with apple or an elon musk of search engines that would have competed with google but what if they can't do it because the tech giants have everything so patented and locked up nobody can compete with them what is the loss of creativity and inventiveness due to the patent system that we can't measure well you just mentioned elon musk there and interesting question here is that elon does patent stuff tesla does patent stuff we see their patents yet elon has said he's really not going to stop any anyone who wants to make for instance an electric car he's not going to hold that against them he's not going to go after them with his patents he's quote unquote opened his patents so then why is he patenting stuff if he's going to open his patents is it to protect tesla from patent trolls well i so i have a bet and i don't know the answer but i'd certainly bet even money on this if it could be proven tesla still takes out the patent so that if uh lucid or rivien which are not trolls uh or someone that is a troll sues tesla saying you stole our idea of the electric car why we thought of that okay that's something lucid and riview would never do of course but if someone were to sue tesla for patent infringement then tesla would say uh uh not so fast we have the patents here they are so in other words my bet is that tesla is just playing the patent game to hold these patents defensively so if anyone sues them for patent infringement they're in a position where they can defend themselves and say no we banded it first but now filing for patents isn't free it's it's for all intents and purposes for you for a big business what is it i mean you may know better than me five thousand dollars ten thousand dollars i don't know it's not enough for tesla to notice or apple or a big company to notice okay so let me walk that back for a second you're right for a big company that they already have a law firm that's probably just normal but for the little guy if jesse and i go out in the garage tomorrow and we want to invent something to file for a patent is a big deal we might that might be our entire quarterly revenue or something to file for a patent and so we have to be very uh selective about if we want to file for them or not so basically the big guys have a big advantage here the apples and the teslas because they can file for a lot of of these things plus if you ever think of suing one of those companies you know they have lawyers whereas jesse and i don't so again it comes down to anti-competitive behavior patents are used they're technically a patent is technically and i'm speaking clinically here a patent is a government-granted monopoly okay once the government hands you a patent you have a monopoly and not on that idea you cannot you you can stop anyone from doing that thing that's written down on that piece of paper and so our government was supposedly put in place to stop monopolies but with the patent system they are literally executing the machinery to grant monopolies on a massive scale to anyone that'll file the paperwork and so a small business you is at a comically ridiculous competitiveness i mean disadvantage doesn't even do it justice right if it comes to a patent war between you and samsung you know it's it that's not a war that's one company just you know walking over another and so the patent system uh certainly does favor the large companies uh as you've said but i have a slightly more fundamental concern than that here's my concern and this one might surprise you just a little bit let's say you guys file a patent i actually believe that when you file that patent you may still be in the wrong because while you think that you invented something i have to ask you do you have mental esp with every human on the planet do you know that no one else has thought of this before somewhere else in the world and you just haven't heard about it how can you say that's not the case there are so many patents for the same thing where food the same thing is just patented over and over it's hundreds of patents for wi-fi everybody claims to be the initial inventor of it and if you file a patent i don't think you have a way of knowing that there's not someone else that has same a similar idea you know people come to me with ideas all the time right and so often i hear the same ideas over and over or someone will give me an obvious idea i have an idea an app that reminds you of your wife's birthday i'm not kidding i've gotten that as a pitch from someone austin you ought to code this i have this idea an app it reminds it reminds you of people's birthdays well aren't there other apps that do that already well i don't know i never researched it and you know so if you file a patent do you really know you're the first person to think of something you know i i'm not i'm not so sure i'd be quick to buy into that to austin's point let's just say you and i both were competing to come up with the best you know cotton gin and uh on the same day in this in a different workshop we both come up with essentially the same thing sure who cares why why should one of us get a monopoly over the other on it why not just both of us make ours one of our businesses does better than the other great but i mean that's an edge case why for the well i mean if you're thinking if you're thinking of the patent office they they weren't thinking of that that was an edge case that was whoa i don't think anyone would think of the same thing at the same time there's only 12 dudes who have the means to produce anything of value inventively but let me change that you invented it first i come to your trade show i see that you've invented it i go home and i make the exact same thing okay and then i go out and try and sell my exact same thing i would have to sue you and claim uh that i had prior art no but what i mean i would have to say look uh no no but what i mean at the 1862 world fair you could have seen my exhibit where i made the time machine you're missing the point what i'm saying is if we got rid of the patent office we got rid of owning a monopoly on that thing that idea then we're just both out making the same thing and you yeah you thought of it first why do you because you thought of it first why do you get to have 20 years of lockup well right so i mean that's what i'm saying i think that the rate of innovation for when the patent office was put into place 20 years to to recoup your investment on the time and the energy to are you seeing these things change faster than once every 20 years that's what i'm saying the the 20-year idea was well i'm going to make a machine that can make ice and you don't have to go to a pond and drag it out of the pond anymore and you can make ice anywhere in the world so i wanted and that took me a very long time and money and soda recoup my investment but i guess what i'm asking is if we didn't ever have the patent system would innovation have stopped well why would i have wanted to have invented that because you still could sell your ice yeah but i mean if some other company could have come in and swiped my invention from underneath i would have kept it locked up in my garage there aren't just iphones now there's all sorts of phones and they're all making money yeah let's i think one thing we need to do to lock this down guys is to let's talk about the present rather than the past because inventing a steam engine long ago a whole company needed to have all this money and they got the pistons and the levers and they're steaming across the great continental divide and there's a 20-year recoup on investment that is the world the patent office was built in that's not the world we live in today why did twitter work is it because they patented it it's because there's no other people trying to be twitter no they had all the right machinery technology ideas reputation credit capital right thing right time and when they did it boom they were out there why did you do your is it because there are you know 10 20 years of research and development nobody else better make any youtube videos or will go bankrupt no you did it because you saw what had to be said and you were gonna damn well say it why did i do x-plane i didn't microsoft flight simulator so i was well i'm gonna make my own dang sim then none of us are thinking about patents none of us need patent protection and then what carries us into the future with me what carries me into the future my reputation my name my customers my customer support and my source code which i keep secret what carries you into the future your reputation your research your development your customer base what do patents have to do with this nothing they haven't protected any of us we don't even have them i don't have a patent i doubt you do either so what's the answer going forward well okay so so i can give you the easiest possible answer there shouldn't be software patents i mean software patents are just plain stupid right uh software patented say i have the idea of a computer doing a thing you know i have the idea of numbers being added that's just stupid software patents are are just so dumb because you're just saying that you own the idea of a computer program without actually going to the trouble to write it and so obliteration of software patents would just be the most easily you know ridiculously zero cost to enact slam dunk you could imagine because at that point the way you have software is you create software and the way you make money from it is by getting it to customers so obliteration software patents wouldn't wouldn't cost a penny and do a huge amount to solve the problem for up to me there'd be no patent system at all what we would do is keep our ideas secret and make our money based on on quality of customer service and quality of deliverable and you know tech support and all the things so many people do badly it's frankly easy to do better this reminds me of music publishing i mean i'm a music publisher and i live in this world where and we all live in this world right where if i sing five notes right now my my gets taken down um a better world i think would be if we changed the stupid system of music publishing so that i could pay that artist for their song a reasonable amount and they would benefit and i would benefit instead i can't even play that song so they're not getting any play on this and so they're seeing no money for it and only the big guys you know the lady gagas of the world who are represented by a big you know uh label are getting any money out of this and i think that's the same kind of system it was invented a long long time ago when it was basically sheet music and a composer right and well what did amadeus mozart come up with today ah shall we see and and again we just and because it does benefit a small number of very rich people this system hasn't changed and i imagine the same thing is true here with patent system it does benefit some very powerful people and they don't want to change it it benefits people with a lot of money because it means that they can they've got a monopoly attack people with patents uh and and also defend their patents because they have their own their whole legal department and you know it's funny when you get into a political discussion around the dinner table at thanksgiving or something i highly doubt that patents is what you guys are going to be talking about it's usually whatever the politicians told us to argue about in that cycle and what the media told us to argue about in that cycle which is the one percent of the one percent of the one percent of the actual problems facing the nation exactly and this is an issue i think you mentioned earlier we would all agree around a dinner table about and say great let's have our politicians change the system but we're not talking about it and that's why i wanted to talk to you today and that's why your movie is so dang important so again if you haven't yet stop watching go watch the patent scam it is so important that you do so that you understand what has happened in the world and what is happening it was fun to make i kind of enjoyed making it i i could see why you got to fly all over the country you got to find this den of scum and villainy i can't believe that you you have some balls oh my god i thought i thought that you were gonna turn around at one point in the and there was just gonna be a cowboy with a gun and he's gonna shoot you dead on this street because you were knocking on too many doors i can't believe you had the the balls to do that it felt we were in russia i thought the story was taking place in oligarchy russia instead it's here in america it would fit so well in the inquisition era of the world it just i can't and if you're a texan you definitely have to watch it because this is happening you know in your state or at least happened perhaps so glad that that's no longer the case yeah so there there were two confrontations that didn't make it into the movie because the the footage was deleted or or i didn't take it but um yeah one one of the people that administered one of these house of trolls or troll hives uh said she was calling the police if i didn't delete the footage and i knew if she called the cops uh the cops weren't there to look out for my interest they were there to look out for their community interest and so i actually deleted some footage what she didn't know is i i crept back later and got the footage quietly so i still got it but what you didn't see is the defensiveness of the other side and they said you better delete that footage or i'm calling the police there's another one where a private investigation firm a firm that does private magnum pi they were filing patent infringement lawsuits in texas literally we're a pi firm and we do patent trolling on the side seriously it was clearly a cut and draw you know a recipe a recipe of how to how to be a patent troll was circulating in eastern texas and i go into the uh office so you know i'm doing an investigation of my own why am i seeing patent infringement lawsuits coming out of a private investigator's office it's you better get out of here right now and comes at me and it's whoa whoa whoa and uh so yeah there were there were a few moments that were a little a little bit uh a little bit hair-raising i couldn't believe when you got footage of an attorney who actually was seemingly proud of the fact that he goes after people who use wi-fi in their internet cafes and it's just he sued people he would go after if a bed and breakfast had wi-fi he would sue the bed and breakfast saying it's my idea to use wi-fi to attract customers that's what his patent was this patent wasn't the invention of wi-fi his patent was using wi-fi the idea of using wi-fi to attract customers and seeds to bed and breakfast and you know hotels and coffee shops and whatnot for stealing his idea by having wi-fi available at their shops and the way i got the interview this is interesting if i got the inter if i tried to get the interview myself i never would have gotten it my film crew we had an intern that didn't know who i was or what i was doing and so he literally did not know that he was setting up an ambush while he set it up he's we want to talk to you about pens can you tell us about patents he was oh i'm going to tell these guys i've got patents i'll tell them exactly what i want him to believe and that's because our intermediary or messenger that set up the interview literally didn't have the sense to know what kind of facts i was going to dig in there to expose and pull out wow thank you for all the work you did austin i mean i can't imagine the amount of work that you put into making that that documentary it's so important oh it's the same amount of work you guys put in a typical six months probably it's fun i don't know that was it was awesome it was amazing and i mean i i honestly don't have the guts that you do to go knocking on doors in east texas so thank you for doing all that work thank you for sharing with us today what's going on if people have questions about this uh who should i mean who should they talk to because i bet a lot of people now are a little bit more scared than they were the day before don't be scared you know that's that's another type of reaction i get from people they say i wanted to start up a small business and now that i've seen the patent scam i'm afraid to do it and i just that that that to me that's that's a heartbreaking thing um don't don't let yourself not start a business just just don't don't answer to fear that remember the supreme court has ruled they have to sue you where you live now so if you start up a small business now and if anyone does see you for patent infringement they will be presenting themselves to a judge in your home town and uh at that point things are gonna start getting pretty nasty for the troll so um don't be afraid to start a small business patent trolling is still a problem but they're primarily going after the big companies now to get the payouts because a big company has a vested interest in keeping the patent system going because that's how they block a competition so patent trolling continues to restrict uh creativity and growth and competition but don't let it stop you from starting a small business i can't believe that your movie didn't have something to do with the supreme court's decision i just think that getting information out there and putting it in such a concise and well-delivered and well-explained format and again go watch the movie if you're watching this still i if you haven't seen the movie it's great that you want to watch to the end and i appreciate that but go watch this movie it will change your perspective on things but i'm so i'm so convinced that your movie definitely had something to do with the fact that the changes i'm so thankful to you that you that you didn't give in and i think you honestly i think that you the reason that people shouldn't be afraid anymore is i think you really had something to do with it yeah austin i am consistently impressed with you and your amazing contributions to humanity thank you yup my pleasure glad to do it ah i am so mad i want to fix this broken patent system and you can see why elon has opened his patents yeah i always wondered why tesla bothered to file for patents which by the way cost tens of thousands of dollars to file for so don't just be well you just fill out a sheet and you send it in no you gotta hire patent attorneys and that's not cheap and it takes a lot of time the people who do the invention also have to sit in on meetings and filth things out so it's a lot of work so why would you do that if you're just gonna open them up yeah and it's twofold tesla files for the patent to protect themselves from patent trolls who would say oh i filed for a stainless steel exoskeleton cyber truck haha let me sue you and then tesla opens them up because elon doesn't want to stifle innovation he doesn't want to become a patent troll himself going i've patented electric vehicles so no one else can work on him he wants companies to make the latest and most technologically advanced sustainable products and the way that elon is doing business kind of flies in the face of the patent system in the way that they kind of envisioned it right to a certain extent i mean i don't think that the patent system was ever supposed to be well i patent the electric car oh well uh dave said that he patented the electric car so i guess no one should be able to do it yeah the way i had always understood it was that if you invented an electric car and no one else had figured it out you could patent that but not the concept of an electric car because again as elon said many times before saying you know i want to go to the moon that's an idea and that's an idea going to the moon making that happen that's hard to do so i think it's really great that tesla opens up their patents it protects themselves yes but it also protects other people making the same design yeah and i mean look at what happened with uh nicola right they sued tesla because they're we have a truck that looks your truck so you can't make your truck um and he knew that this would happen to him and the reason it hasn't happened more often is because he's doing this he's filing constantly for patents so he's protecting himself not so that he can stand there and say here's our portfolio of patents that makes our company so valuable so that they can just do business he's basically found this hack to work around the system and we only learned about this because of austin's work and it wasn't a very cheap hack either it's not oh well that's the easy way to go it's not easy at all i mean it might be easier than being faced with a thousand patent troll lawsuits but i mean really this is what we need to do you're creating barriers of entry to to running businesses and i don't think that that's what the patent system was supposed to do is actually supposed to give the the inventor you know a leg up over companies that could just come in and bulldoze him or her so i can't stress enough how amazing austin's documentary the patent scam is i mean first of all you have to go watch it right now you can find it in the show notes below i am so impressed with the work that austin put into making this documentary i mean he flew to texas and not houston he flew to where was it yeah the middle of nowhere eastern texas part of texas you've never thought of and is very far away from anywhere um and he confronted the very people who were doing the awful patent scams i mean it took some real guts to do what he did and i think his work actually helped make the change i mean as we discussed in the interview the supreme court ruled that you can no longer do what happened to austin you can't file a lawsuit in the eastern district of texas and then make the defendants go to the eastern district of texas to defend themselves there right and so yeah i think that whether in whole or in part austin's documentary made an impact and i think that it's really important to show that someone can make a difference that and i'm just so thankful to austin that he spent the the time the money the resources the effort um to make not just a youtube not just a a movie not just a where he's sitting down and explaining it he made an entertaining feature length documentary if you can applaud him in the comments down below give him some love down there because what an awesome guy because i just want to remind you this is the same guy who put up a million dollars to his own money of his own money to buy four electric school buses and then give them away in his home state yeah and you know that that's going to make a difference you know that parents of the students who get on that bus are going to be gloating to those other parents who their kids are getting on the diesel buses and they're going to go why are my children getting on such dirty buses yeah if you haven't seen that interview go check it out here anyway thank you so much for watching we're gonna see you next week now you know,0

us and we carbon offset the production the shipping and the life cycle of every product and we plant a tree for every order and we help cap a well for every order this week we're talking about the world's electrical grids and what powers them now for the longest time and i'm talking decades here when i talked with very smart people about how i believed wind and solar could power the electrical grids on this planet i was met with all kinds of excuses why that would never happen do you know how many solar panels you'd have to make where would you put them all what happens at night or when it isn't sunny what happens when the wind doesn't blow it just won't work the grid can't handle intermittent loads and for decades i thought well maybe they're right because nobody seems to be building a lot of solar and wind farms it really was that intermittent part of the equation that held back solar and wind because that point was a good one what do you do when the sun isn't out or it isn't windy and also the costs were a lot higher back then without a way to store energy on a massive scale solar and wind power couldn't be more than a small piece of the grid puzzle but then one day elon musk said hey we've got these lithium-ion batteries that we use in our electric cars we could also bundle them together into packs for people to use in their homes and huge packs that could be used on the grid and many people scoffed as they usually do when a new idea comes along and they said that'll never work but then tesla built the hornsdale battery in south australia within a hundred days and it worked perfectly and all the naysayers were forced to shut the [ __ ] up i literally think that this was the tipping point because you couldn't argue with success the hornsdale battery worked on every metric speed to install cost of the project safety it paid for itself within the first couple years and i don't want to make it seem elon was the only person who understood that batteries were the answer to grid scale storage there were a lot of smart people working on grid battery solutions it's just that i believe the world wasn't ready for them until after tesla hornsdale one of those people was donald sadaway a professor at mit who over 10 years ago was working on a different kind of battery to do the same thing as tesla's battery store a lot of power cheaply and safely professor sataway didn't want to use lithium-ion batteries he founded a company called ambry to make batteries that were dirt cheap i to say if you want to make something dirt cheap make it out of dirt and preferably dirt that's locally sourced so if i take a a shovel full of dirt out of my own backyard and put it on the lab bench and tell my students you got to make a battery out of what's in that pile of dirt i know that when we make a battery it's going to be dirt cheap and i got a secure supply chain so we thought about that from the beginning and if you take a look at the kinds of metals that we're working with the stuff that ambry's pursuing right now involves calcium and antimony and the the salt is calcium chloride which is road salt that's what we're throwing on the on the road today because i can see it's snowing right now and we'll be using calcium chloride on the on the sidewalks and on the roadways so we've given considerable thought to making sure that the constituents the components are earth abundant ethically sourced and with a secure supply chain ambry's liquid metal battery is being used as we speak at terracycle's data center near reno nevada it works differently than a lithium-ion battery the way the liquid metal battery works is first of all you got to imagine what it looks inside there's three layers there's a top layer which is a low density liquid metal and that's going to be the negative electrode and then underneath that is a molten salt which is the electrolyte and then beneath that is the high density liquid metal which is the positive electrode so you got two electrodes separated by an electrolyte that's the workings of every battery and in this instance the metals are insoluble in the salt and the salt is insoluble in the metals so these three layers even though they're all liquid they don't mix they stratify sort of salad oil and vinegar only in this case you have three layers not two the energy is stored in these liquid metal electrodes so when you go to discharge to discharge the battery you want to draw current you connect the electrodes across some load and some appliance what have you and the the way the current is generated the metal of the top electrode wants to alloy with the metal and the bottom electrode but i just told you they don't they're not soluble so the only way the metal from the top electrode can get to the bottom electrode is for the metal of the top electrode to become an ion so it becomes an ion and then the ion goes across the electrolyte and meets the positive electrode where the electrons that have been generated have gone through the external circuit and then they combine with the ion to make it into a neutral metal and now the top layer is getting thinner the bottom layer is getting thicker and that's how we generate the current one of the big benefits of ambry's battery is that it works for a long time there's a push and a pull here so the pull is that these batteries operating at elevated temperature can cycle with very very high uh charging and discharging rates and um they can also cycle deep discharge many times at thousands of cycles and uh without capacity fade in other words after we have data from from ambry after 5 000 cycles the batteries are still retaining 99 plus percent of their original charge so these are these are powerful advantages because if you if you put batteries on the grid you're not going to change them every two three years the way you do with your phone or your laptop computer you want to put them there for for 20 years and that means you have to have batteries that don't lose their capacity so so these are some of the advantages that you get from the liquid metal battery and also the price point is very very low but the other thing is the the disadvantages of lithium ion lithium ion works beautifully in in the small format but if you start putting uh hundreds of thousands of lithium ion batteries in close proximity you're going to have to be very aggressive about thermal management because they're going to heat up and if they heat up they could go supercritical and burst into flame and so on there's an optimum application for uh these various battery chemistries and i think that when you go to grid level storage uh lithium-ion might not be the the best fit i mean we we see some evidence of lithium-ion being deployed but um i think in terms of round trip efficiency and and safety and and long service lifetime i think liquid metal battery is a better fit now ambry's battery uses a liquid metal chemical process and therefore it uses metals but what if i told you that other smart people were developing batteries that store power using this what was this air i'm talking about making a battery that uses something that's even cheaper than dirt air wait you're talking about the liquid air battery where you can press air to store the energy exactly this is javier cavada ceo and president of high view power you can store power by compressing air exactly i mean the only inputs here is electricity and air so which i mean air as we all know is available anywhere that there are human beings and electricities can be funded grid can be from a solar function with a wind farm or can we find a mix so cooling down there and aside is an extremely standard process you are just reducing the temperature reducing the temperature and then then you go from gas to the point of liquefaction but in the meantime there are some components of the air that we are breathing that don't get into liquid would get into solid co2 if there is some pollution in the air or or the water so so we are extracting water so the air we are drying it out and we are taking the co2 out so you can really capture the carbon that you have in there in a place just to say a place la that i was just before the lockdown and it was a bit a bit dusty atmosphere it's more easier it's a better world it was a bittersweet you would you would just deliver electricity and air but the air you deliver back to the atmosphere is cleaner so you can compress air into a liquid to store the energy and then when you let it expand you take the high pressure gas that powers a turbine to make electricity again yep and as javier explained in the process you also take co2 out of the air so it could even be carbon negative and because you're using air to fill the tanks you can sight these batteries anywhere in the world and just with ambry's battery a compressed air battery doesn't degrade as you charge and discharge it and another huge advantage of compressed air batteries is that they get cheaper as they get bigger if a lithium ion is is able to make one hour you want two hours you need to double the cost you want to make 20 hours you need to multiply by 10 that cost i mean in our case adding hours is marginal right because big steel tanks are way cheaper to build than lithium-ion batteries okay so here's the thing we've just talked about three battery technologies that are all being used as we speak to store energy at grid scale they are all in their infancy and yet they all appear to be very cheap so even if you don't believe one of them will work for whatever reason maybe you think we'll run out of air or maybe the sound of molten metal scares you it's hard to argue that none of them will work especially since they're all working right now what we were talking about is none other than a technological disruption a technology that did not exist a few years ago grid scale batteries is now becoming commonplace well great i'm excited but what does this have to do with the title of the episode stranded all those power plants stranded on a desert island well here's where i want to bring in someone we admire a lot on this author educator and co-founder of rethinkx tony seba in one of tony's latest videos he makes a very good case for the fact that many energy analysts and financial experts are still valuing traditional fuel power plants i mean coal power natural gas power and even nuclear powered plants with way more value than they should be getting you see when you consider building or buying something for a business you do a calculation you consider the cost of the purchase balanced against what value it will bring to your business over a certain amount of time so for instance if you're the ceo of a power utility company and you're considering buying a new coal powered power plant what would you do how would you know if this new coal power plant would pay for itself i mean i would take its price to build and then i would also need to know how much it costs to maintain uh plus the cost of say the coal every year and then i'd need to know its expected life span and then i need to know pretty much how much power can produce and then i could probably figure out the cost of its electricity good that's exactly what energy analysts and industry experts do they calculate the levelized cost of electricity or lcoe now to simplify the calculation is the total cost of the plant so the construction the maintenance and the coal etc over how much electricity it produces in its expected lifespan well that looks pretty simple you said that the analysts and experts are getting this wrong i mean how did they get this wrong did they forget how to do long division they must have been doing this calculation for years exactly what do you mean exactly they've been doing this calculation for years that's why they're getting it wrong now but if they've been doing these calculations for years they must be really good at doing these calculations why are they getting it wrong math hasn't changed well because something has changed oh i see they were doing the calculations for years when there was pretty much only one way to make electricity but now there are new cheaper ways to make electricity which is solar wind and batteries exactly and that is throwing off a key part of their calculations see the bottom part of the equation there the part that estimates how much power the plant will be making for how long well it used to be that all you had to worry about was things you know downtime for maintenance stuff that otherwise the plant would be up and running at close to full capacity for its entire lifetime but if along comes wind and solar farms producing power much cheaper so a lot of the time people will now be buying power from renewables the coal plant will be offline so so that formula has a smaller number on the bottom and we all remember our grade school math right fractions everybody take out your math books and turn to chapter 13. as the amount of electricity that our new coal plant produces goes down because there's less demand the cost per kilowatt hour of the electricity goes up and as it goes up less and less people want to pay for it because it's more expensive than the electricity coming from solar and wind farms bingo we have a stranded asset and that's why we're seeing more and more fossil fuel plants being shut down prematurely but i don't get who's making these wrong calculations well the iea for one the international energy agency i mean yeah their predictions are always wrong but i mean who cares well hang on take a look at this chart from the iea okay i don't even really know what i'm looking at here okay the black points on the graph are now historical data of how much coal energy was produced each year in the u.s okay now see those gray lines emanating from the data points those are iea's projections each year of what the future of coal would look wait so the iea kept projecting that coal would bounce back coal power has dropped in half over the past decade but if you would listen to the iaea you would have gotten it completely wrong okay so the iea is wrong who cares uh the world economy what well who reads those iea reports i don't know i mean we do but we don't really take it that seriously well yeah we do but who else i don't know how about bankers economists elected officials oh i see everyone in the world who makes big decisions is getting the wrong information exactly if the people who make billion dollar decisions about our power grid don't understand what's happening they're going to be deploying capital into something that is about to implode well isn't that good i mean we don't fossil fuels so let's let them implode yeah but we're talking about governments countries your tax dollars we're talking about people who work for these fossil fuel companies a lot of people are about to be out of jobs and then there are companies and people and jobs that rely on those people the truck drivers and the railways who transport those fuels when they lose their jobs they may stop going to restaurants and into the stores and stimulating the economy yeah i mean the economy is a big spider web of connections historically when decision makers don't understand what's coming and they rely on what they've been doing for decades they make very costly very bad decisions that allocate capital very inefficiently because things power plants are basically paid for by ratepayers you and me and just take a look at all of these coal natural gas and nuclear plants in the world today right just look at all of this electrical grid infrastructure much of which is about to become outdated uneconomic and obsolete and when hundreds of millions even billions of dollars get spent wrong who pays for it we do the good news is that as we transition to solar and wind with batteries electricity is going to get cleaner and cheaper for all of us but we need to educate our elected officials and our economists and our bankers and our fund managers about this new disruption or they will misallocate capital into investments that used to seem secure power plants instead of investing in new technologies that sound fantastical molten metal batteries and air batteries and these if you're watching this and you must be then you're in a very small group of people on the planet that get what's going on and what's about to happen and historically when a person knows before anyone else what is about to happen they can profit from it they can choose a better career path and better investments and that's why we started the disruptive investing where you can see interviews with ambry and highview power and many more thought leaders who are disrupting current technology and you can join our now you know investor club where we have monthly live streams with presidents and ceos of companies who are bringing these disruptive technologies to life you could join our 1400 investor club members who are profiting from these new trends that quite frankly very few people understand so head on over to patreon.com now you know and help support our and help support yourself i mean the only thing preventing all of us from hearing about the best technologies is research and you can either put your trust into cnbc and you know all of these analysts who want to tell you a certain thing because they're pretty much ready to go or somebody is why not rely on crowdsourced information with again over 1400 investors who are constantly combing through the internet to try and find some of these new companies i mean that's how we've heard of some of these companies exactly we have some of the best people in the world finding out about these new technologies and then because of you because you're subscribed because our numbers are big enough when we reach out to those companies we can get right to their presidents and their ceos and bring them right to you and it's something that's so unique across the entire internet because most people are still not sold on this idea that solar wind and batteries are going to be the future of power generation and this is just one small part of a larger revolution that we're seeing in the world because obviously with the decline of fossil fuels which is going to happen um most people are still not sold on that so when you go to most of these investing sites they're well make sure that you're diversify your portfolio get some exon in there and some hydrogen yeah because the dividends on exxon references can't be beat you know forget the fact that the company's gonna go out of business in the next few decades uh just focus on that nice juicy dividend exactly there's a lot of new up-and-coming technologies a lot of companies that we haven't heard of and therefore we think well they can't have any value but think of tesla just a few years ago it was this tiny little startup and now it's a behemoth and you might be saying well zach and jesse i don't care about profit but what you're actually doing is you are allocating capital you are voting with your money where you want to see the future to go and we firmly believe that tony seba is right um that if you're investing money into some of these more traditional technologies where you burn stuff to get power you're essentially just burning your money away because these plants are not going to be profitable going forward and haven't been historically in the short term that is why it is so important to be thinking about stuff this yeah so thank you so much for watching support our hit the button and head on over to patreon where you can support us even more thank you so much everybody now you know,0
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJl35aIy5pOVBHvoGgqavrdJ,aUC6lsLr04I,"hey everybody i'm zack and i'm jesse and you're watching in-depth on now you know this week's show is sponsored by our friends at the schaumburg illinois fairfield inn & suites by marriott what makes them special jesse well they are the only hotel in the chicago area that are solar-powered yeah they are all right so we're gonna be covering in this in depth another fantastic article by ross hessian in seeking alpha now you might be saying seeking alpha oh no coz seeking alpha has lots of stories that are very funny right ross is one of these people who does not write fudd articles he writes super well research articles and he just publishes them to seeking alpha that's right there are many writers of seeking alpha he is one of them this is one of his articles yeah and we're gonna take you through how rivia n--'s latest truck reveal and gm's factory shut down now fits in with the decimation of big oil and big auto so let's dive right in alright so i want to start by pulling a gem of a chart out of ross's article this year sets the stage it shows the adoption of technology in the united states from 1900 to present so what's the first thing you think of when you see this chart just yeah that's a rainbow yeah it looks a rainbow it's a big messy squiggly bunch of lines hard to understand so let's let's break it down yeah okay the first line on the left is a big dark blue line that shows that the telephone took seven years to be adopted from about 10% adoption to 80 percent adoption wow who was in 1960 who didn't have a telephone well think about the lot parts of the country had to be wired so if your town wasn't wired for telephone you know it wasn't cheap it took a long time to actually physically technologically wire up the country okay next line is electricity and that took 35 years for very similar reasons if you didn't have a line going to your house electricity you didn't have electricity wow next is ice cars that took 50 years and that's because they're not cheap they're expensive and a bad horses why give up my horse i mean i just feed him some hay and i don't have to go to the gas station but then we start to see some interesting things happen so next is radio and that only took 15 years and that's because radios weren't that expensive and they got cheaper and cheaper refrigerators that took eighteen years because some people sell out ice boxes for a while and it's a good alternative next is black-and-white tvs that only took eight years yeah wow to 80% adoption that's amazing now color tv took a little longer ten years why do you think that is they had a pretty decent alternative yeah already got a tv i need your color whippersnapper thing right credit cards took a bit longer 35 years and that's because you went from paying cash to using credit which is a huge shift in how you think about spending i think a lot of people bach did that and still do next is microwave oven so that only took nine years the pc took 25 years but that's because they weren't cheap when they first came out the cost thousands of dollars room size and they didn't do much i mean right be honest word processing next is a cell phone that took nine years now we see this clump of lines and that is internet digital camera mp3 players hdtv social media smartphones tablets what are those lines look two straight lines vertical they're just going as soon as the technology comes out it's a matter of weeks and months before you get it right so it's not the years that we're talking about before maybe i'll get the telephone in in 14 more years something you know some crazy thing that right it's just okay christmas i guess i'll get a an mp3 player exactly so what does this chart look adoption is accelerating these things that you know usually would have taken decades now take a matter of years right that's because technology is accelerating because when we introduce a new technology it can get to all of us faster and cheaper faster so keep these adoption curves in mind and how they are accelerating now ross points out that many analysts graphs that try to predict the future of the shift from ice to evi sales look this it doesn't really look those adoption curves that we were looking at before right you see that yellow line right there's a little there's a little bit of an s-curve and then it goes up to 80% right it's not how it works not as more people get it more people want to get it in the price technology right exactly ross says that can't be right so what is going to happen to ice car sales it's not gonna obvious we follow that curve so as ross points out there are two problems with this graph one doesn't look a typical disruption curve and two and i'm quoting here the decision to purchase a new car is separate from an independent of the decision to purchase an eevee instead of an ice vehicle when someone decides their next car will be an eevee sales of ice vehicles drop immediately however eevee sales do not grow until that person finds an eevee with features and price that meets that person's needs so there's a gap basically there's a gap between when someone gets in a model 3 because i've seen i've seen this mhm people will get in a model 3 or many different v's you get them in an eevee you show them what it can do and the switchin area goes wow i this is amazing i don't want to drive my honda civic to work anymore many different reasons why you might want to switch to an eevee right and all of a sudden you're not thinking about okay i'm gonna get a new car you're just thinking about i'm gonna get an eevee when can i get it and when can i afford it right so it's important to not get lost on this step when someone realizes that they want an eevee they will wait for up to three or four years until they can buy that eevee even if tv they want isn't available yet meanwhile what happens to i sales they they plummet they stop happening because that that person who was waiting right who is going to in one or two years buy a nice car doesn't show up at the dealership that day and the dealer goes huh business seems a little slow oh must be the weather or something that but in reality the people who were going to be showing up that day are waiting for they're dreaming exactly so based on ross's analysis and his number crunching ice car sales will approach zero around 2026 and v's will approach 1 billion tvs on the road by 2032 so now let's introduce oil into this equation oil surpluses or a glut of oil is gonna happen around 2023 well i can't quite keep all of this in my head i know what is it look you know what are we talking about here here's a chart that ross made to help visualize this blue is ice car sales so what are those doing they are going down wow red is evey sales what's that look they are going up yeah s-curve exactly just a regular adoption curve that we're used to seeing exactly and i mean this one is slower than say tablets but i mean that's because cars are more offensive than tablet you got it okay so now green line is ice plus evy sales so you see how it goes down at first because there's not enough eevee's being produced and people are waiting for them and then as v's get produced enough it starts to go back up so wait you're saying around 2025 2026 you're saying that there's just gonna be less cars on the road or something i mean if the if the ice sales are going down and the evie sales are going up but they haven't caught up with each other yet there's gonna be a lot of used ice cars on the road a lot of cars that need repairing so you're saying that if you're a mechanic shop that's the year that's the year and it's gonna be misleading because you're gonna think oh my god if this trend continues i'm gonna be fixing cars because my life you're seeing you're seeing a graph that goes right you're thinking our business is going up right for mechanics and then it's gonna go as well everyone starts buying new v's doctrine and well they just don't need that kind of maintenance right so we're pointing this out ross is pointing it out so that you can kind of get a glimpse of what's coming down the road okay so what's this purple line here that purple line is oil in millions of barrels per day so what do you what does that look it's doing it is dropping off right pretty steadily yeah and so basically by 2023 there's going to be an oil glut so what you need for oil glut is to have less demand for oil and when you hit about a million barrels per day of less demand you get an oil glut so a million barrels per day of overproduction right now we're gonna see that later in the article so hang on to that little nugget of information so let's talk about passenger car sales in the us they are down dramatically and most analysts and big auto attribute this to what changing consumer preference yeah and they're right about that except for one key point what do they attribute that changing consumer preference to oh well they think that everyone is is ditching their sedans for suvs and pickup trucks wrong but it wrong yeah why the sales of passenger cars are down because a large number of consumers have realized that evs are superior and they're either buying v's instead or they're waiting for an eevee the one segment where there isn't much choice yet is suvs and pickup trucks and that is why that i segment is still doing ok and that's what's misleading everyone in big auto but there are already first movers in this space the rivia nar won t just came out the other day along with the rivia r1s the ballinger the workhorse w15 the have allure bison and soon will be tesla who will also be entering the pickup truck space so gm recently said they won't be working on an eevee pickup truck or suv and ross thinks that this is a misdirection why so gm only has two choices they can either say that we're gonna come out with an electric pickup truck right why wouldn't they do that well if they say that what happens to their existing customers who are just about to buy a new pickup truck they won't buy the pickup truck because they're worried about maintenance and it being you know covered and also why why buy a works technology of gm is switching right and it's gonna take gm and ford years to actually come out with this pickup truck so for years they'll have no sales i see and but what's the other option the other options say we're not working on an eevee pickup truck or suv keep buying your your gm and ford i see so for a while they're basically just lying to everyone saying there you don't need electric pickup trucks keep buying our gas ones instead right well there is a third option okay and that would be that they say we're not working on electric pickup trucks and they're not that's true it's possible i think that that probably would be the worst option that would be the worst option for them ross thinks that this is a misdirection he thinks that gm and ford are working on them and just can't tell anyone because the second they do their sales will drop and those sales will start to drop fast because it's hard for big auto to ramp up production fast enough to catch on to this train it doesn't even matter if they can hold off on this misdirection for long enough because all of these other competitors are entering the space what they were kind of banking on i think was that the vivian was gonna be kind of just a man kind of sort of a workhorse ii kind of meh ish truck not that workhorse couldn't work or anything that but i'm saying you know it's not as exciting as the ribbing or that the the tesla pickup truck wouldn't come out on time or it would be dumb somehow they're just hoping that there would be no one in this space and they would be safe for a while there's this little cell right and let's remind everyone gm is closing factories right now because the cars they're making nobody wants to buy and that's just the passenger vehicles because there's now competition in that field as soon as there's competition in the truck field they'll be closing those plants as well right so let's go to this question that ross brings up could tesla acquire ford when ford goes bankrupt that's a question yeah so i mean when elon tweeted back in june that tesla had hit 7,000 cars in seven days ford's president for europe middle east in africa he tweeted 7,000 cars circa four hours heart ford team now as ross and we pointed out at the time this makes people who don't understand disruptions laugh at how small and inconsequential tesla seems but we know that this is just ignorance and it's ignoring the new trend right it's kind of if you were kodak making fun of a new digital camera company in the beginning of digital cameras going oh nobody's buying those silly digital cameras right and now try and find a film camera exactly ford is wasting resources building hybrids and they have two hundred and twenty-two billion dollars in total liabilities on their books billion with a b yeah so look how quickly us passenger car sales market has tanked when evie options for pickups and suvs come out this will happen in that segment too and then game over ice and that's the gap that we're talking about that's that gap in total car sales right it's gonna be this weird period where you don't see new cars on the road right and everyone's going to the mechanic shop all the mechanic shops are booked all the time it's a good time to be up again no mechanic as long as you're cutting and running right you gotta sell that shop while it's still a little hot you gonna call it oh you gotta call it you know doug's ice and evie shop yeah maybe it would definitely be smart to be training up some some technician yes on v's all right now let's put oil into this equation right so i mean let's go back to the chart and that purple line just kind of slowly dips off you're saying there's gonna be some kind of a bad thing that happens based on so basically what well as ross points out in 2014 oil producers over produced by about 1.5 million barrels per day and this is what happened to oil prices in that year went from over a hundred dollars a barrel to down around $40 a barrel out just because they were over producing there was still plenty of demand mm-hmm to keep an oil gut from happening these cast of characters and here's the pie chart here showing you who the cast of characters are they have to work together to reduce supplies when v's start increasing demand so here's the cast of characters russia u.s. saudi arabia china iran canada iraq kuwait they all have to get along and go oh comrade usa of course we all cut production make less money to make good oil price sounds good but they're good all right not gonna happen can you picture that no here's the thing eevee's are already reducing demand by 250,000 barrels of oil a day that's already happening because largely because of electric buses right so all we need to do is get to about a million barrels per day and this glut will start to happen when that happens to keep the glut from happening all these oil producers will have to get together and reduce production now you say maybe maybe that could happen ross isn't the only one saying this can happen this bloomberg chart shows the same thing that by 2023 that's when we expect there to be this million barrel per day oil glut now you might say well all they have to do is just cut production enough to keep that from happening but let's take a look at this 56 percent of global oil demand comes from transportation problem for oil producers in 2023 will be that each year it will get worse for them as more and more v's are sold so they'll be less and less oil demand and the price of oil will drop more and more and they'll want to sell more and more to make up for that loss right which just increases the supply and therefore it lowers the price right so you're losing money you're an oil-producing country that's your one big revenue source you're losing money from it every year more and more the price is dropping per barrel more and more right you're gonna want to do what sell more sell more that's that's all you've got right this is what's gonna cause that little area in 2023 to be cheap gasoline and so all those used ice cars will be very attractive there'll be a very attractive ice used market out there and so that will mislead people again into thinking oh evs are done it's only a short period where this happens ross goes on to explain that starting in 2016 the u.s. reversed a 40-year ban on selling us crude oil reserves so the us for decades stored oil in case there was a global meltdown right but in 2016 they reversed that and started selling oil why it seems bad strategy it seems you're in trouble you're just inviting yourself for trouble they finally figured this out which ross is just figured out which is that there's going to be a glut of oil and there's no reason to hold it any longer in fact get rid of it at higher prices so you we're just expecting the price to drop on it so why would you hold a useless commodity exactly four years we were told there's gonna be this thing called peak oil and we're gonna run out of oil so you better hoard it now that we've got new technology and we're able to drill pretty much everywhere and find oil there's not gonna be peak oil there's gonna be a glut of oil and so that's why even the us this is kind of proving his argument the u.s. is dumping oil if you want to learn more about what oil companies to start shorting i urge you to read at ross's article all right so to summarize if you've just been kind of zoning out during this because you there's too many charts and graphs i think this one chart explains it best let's go back to it ice car sales are going to zero quickly an oil glut could happen around 2023 and evi sales will continue to take off look for big oil and big auto to really start hurting soon especially when the evi suvs and pickup trucks start rolling out in full if you're thinking that 2023 still sounds far away because i know you're all thinking you're well still 2018 right think about what you were doing in 2013 because that's the same amount of time back as we're talking about going forward does 2013 feel to you it was back in the old days not really no it's and i mean our new young so that's a big chunk of my life right there right i mean you were in college right and so it's not far away i think so many people think well this is just decades away if ross is right with his projections and i think they're actually kind of conservative this is all gonna be happening very soon straights again it goes back to the accelerated growth curves that we're seeing things happen faster you can get a factory up and running far faster than you used to be able to before you can get robots in there you can start producing faster and faster than we ever could before and i mean keep in mind in 2013 the model s was basically the only electric car that could go over 200 miles right now we have so many more options and they are just continuing to grow in number and i mean riffian just followed in tesla's footsteps they founded a mitsubishi factory that was selling dirt cheap they secretly you know start building a luxury suv and pickup truck it's going to be expensive but it's going to be amazing when it comes out right and and here's one thing that i think that a lot of people kind of miss they they look at the front of the truck and they go oh that thing's ugly no one's gonna buy it and oh it's gonna be so expensive no one's gonna buy it not everyone has to buy the rivey and truck for them to make a huge impact in the market right okay but they have to make a tiny little blip okay cuz right now all they need to do is raise more money and they can do that by selling a luxury high margin exact on the truck just tested it and they don't have to sell it to everyone on the street they just have to sell a few tens of thousands there they're creating a luxury brand name just tesla so that when you hear ribbing you'll think luxury then if they release a lower priced pickup truck which shouldn't be hard to do right you'll be i'm buying a ribbon too right it's it's brilliant it's exactly what tesla did i think that it's a really really smart move and enemy people think that oh tesla's are too expensive therefore no one buys a tesla that is not the case people by tesla's now that the model 3 comes down obviously more people by tesla's but people have been buying model s's since it came out and that is kind of what made tesla possible is people buying model s's the people buying model access these are really really expensive cars normal people do not have these cars and now they're finally producing model threes which can actually be bought by normal people now i urge you to read ross's article fantastic we only kind of touched the surface it's a real deep dive he's got all the facts and figures to back it up

but if you have ever bought gasoline there's a good chance that some of it came from russia and that some of your hard-earned money went to fund the tanks that are rolling over the ukrainian border whoa whoa jesse uh are you accusing me of funding a dictator here i think i just made it clear that i'm accusing just about everybody but don't get it twisted it's not your fault if i helped pay for it why isn't it my fault the reason that we still see gas pumps is because russia the us and the rest of the world has its own oligarchs and they've been pushing the levers of power to create the outcome they want this war is just a mere side effect of their profit schemes hang on what do you mean by oligarchs we live in a free democracy well they might be faceless corporations but whether it's oil companies utilities or foreign powers your choices and your wallet has been heavily influenced by their decisions but i mean there is something you can do i mean i've made changes that make me far less dependent on foreign fossil fuels you may be wondering why i brought you here uh let's just see this this is our solar system installed by solarcity now tesla back in 2013. and uh nine kilowatts of power that i get every day it's operated flawlessly and we never had to have them come out and fix anything because it works perfectly but i hear what you're saying what do i do when the sun goes down um well that's why we got these four power walls installed four years ago and we've had plenty of times we've shown you on the show what happens when we lose our power these back it up electric cars are another big piece of the puzzle and we don't just talk the talk here on the show we walk the walk or we drive the drive and we've been driving electric cars in my family for about 10 years in fact all we have in the family right now are electric cars and i got to tell you they're pretty awesome the last piece of the puzzle is that my house is heated right now with natural gas so what we're doing this year is we're working with dandelion and their geothermal company they're going to come and install geothermal loops down in the ground and we're going to get all of our heat from the earth and some electricity and that's going to be the last piece of the puzzle for us these are changes that people can make to significantly reduce their carbon footprint but also their dependence on foreign fossil fuels and you could have made these changes much earlier zach hang on what are we talking about i got solar back in 2013. i mean i suppose i could have done it a few years earlier but no i mean if president reagan let's say when he took office back in 1980 hadn't ripped the solar panels off the white house roof that president carter had installed oh i see right that would have sent a message to the country that solar panels were a good thing but instead we all thought back then that solar wasn't a viable option i wonder why and in 1999 gm took back and crushed their ev1 electric cars this was after gm themselves lobbied against carb regulations in california which would have mandated a certain number of zero-emission vehicles be produced by each car manufacturer as soon as those regulations were off the table gm crushed the cars setting back ev adoption by over a decade and i mean i wanted to buy that car back in 1999 and i wanted to get solar back then too it was due to the oligarchs that we weren't allowed to have these options and just recently we've seen utilities change rates and influence state and local governments to pass legislation barring or slowing solar and ev adoption oh right i mean we just covered a court case in arizona where in 2014 the utility company salt river project started charging customers with solar 65 percent more for electricity and then a 9th circuit appellate court found them guilty of anti-trust law violations this year there have also been recent bills proposed in florida california new york and iowa to slow down solar and bills in oklahoma mississippi and west virginia which would make it harder for tesla to sell evs all these bills come from the people the oligarchs who want to slow down renewable adoption now you might be thinking that this whole argument against big oil is climate change right there goes these hippie dippies talking about saving the planet again well saving the planet yes but it's not always just about saving the world from greenhouse gases let's talk about the economy rising energy prices right now are going to be one of the biggest contributors to rising inflation there's a reason why the oil embargo of the 1970s led to the highest inflation rates the u.s has seen in decades do you want to see mortgage rates go up to 18 percent again do you know how impossible that makes buying a house for the average person but do you want to talk about going to bed scared at night what do you mean nuclear war no something less existential but something that we're all facing right now what are you talking about if you own an ev right now driving isn't as scary as if you own an ice car the price of filling up your ice cars tank with gas is likely going to go up very quickly as it has been for the past couple weeks with no end in sight that uncertainty is scary eevee drivers on the other hand will pay much less to drive the same number of miles we won't have to worry about lines at the gas station or running out of gas our electrons are not going to run out especially if you get your electrons from your roof solar system and i know what a lot of you are saying right now zach and jesse getting solar batteries geothermal and ev these things ain't cheap but you know what they're not expensive either especially when you factor in how much you'll save over time don't be scared off by what you think might be too big a price tag for your budget there are a bunch of tax incentives for all four of those things that could go a long way to making them more achievable for you all i'm asking is that you do a bit of research and find out if maybe just maybe one or more of these new technologies might actually be affordable to you and even if they aren't a perfect fit for you right now consider budgeting for them for further down the road and tell your friends and family about them but you know what when we face existential threats from climate change and war if we had strong leadership we could be making these systems even more affordable and easy to get exactly this is where politicking fails just come out and say what we need to do clearly we need to transition away from fossil fuels as fast as possible for so many reasons here are some upgrades we can make on how we live let's make it doable for the average person and take back our freedom and energy independence now a lot of smart people and resources are going into carbon removal technologies these companies we emit 43 billion tons of co2 globally every year and the goal of many of these technologies is to get the price of removing one ton of co2 from the atmosphere down to about a hundred dollars according to the epa a typical gas-burning car produces 4.6 tons of co2 per year and ev produces zero so even if we could get the price of capturing one ton of co2 down to a hundred dollars my ev just saved four hundred and sixty dollars we should be giving everyone who drives an electric car 460 a year you know what doesn't emit carbon in the first place though solar wind evs and geothermal great point why not spend the money on these four things so that we can create electricity transportation heat and cool our buildings and water all cleanly to begin with instead we pollute our air and then we want to spend more money to try and clean it are we really that stupid lastly there's one more thing you can do which is completely free speak up that's right we're asking you to speak up use that voice of yours no matter where you live contact your representatives in government from local state provincial all the way up to the federal level tell them that you're watching how they vote and you vote for representatives who support sustainable renewable energy not big oil subsidies i know i know it's tough you say to keep up with what's going on on the state and local level so join a local group in your area that keeps tabs on government join them support them go to some meetings meet some folks you who care about what's going on it'll be a positive addition to your life i guarantee it and if you're intrigued about getting solar but you got lots of questions about it which i know i did when i was getting solar contact our friends over at energypal they have all the answers and they'll give them to you for free and as we mentioned we're still burning natural gas to heat the house and studios here at now you know but we made the decision a few months ago to switch to geothermal because our friends at dandelion just started installing geothermal systems in our area we're going to be telling you much more about this in the months to come but we wanted to test it out for you first so we could share our experience how the planning and installation works how much money and energy we end up saving and we want to share our entire experience going geothermal with you so you can have more information and again the reason that this isn't your fault is that if our leaders had decided that this was important we could have already become energy independent every country has sun wind and geothermal energy the technologies the wind turbines the solar panels the batteries geothermal heat pumps they've been around for decades for those of you who believe that this transition will take decades it simply doesn't have to the reason we got to the moon in less than 10 years after president kennedy led the nation to get there it's because of leadership determination and money for less than we subsidized big oil we could become energy independent and install solar panels wind turbines batteries and geothermal and drive evs everywhere we just have to demand it you have a voice you have the power now go make it happen thanks for watching everybody we'll see you next week now you know,0
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJl35aIy5pOVBHvoGgqavrdJ,o6rYoKGE8I0,"hey everybody i'm zack and i'm jesse and you're watching in-depth on now you know sponsored this week by a better route planner a better route planner makes finding chargers and intuitive experience when you're zoomed out the highest power charging stations are displayed when you zoom in more lower power charging stations appear helping you find the best charger on your way another feature making this a better route planner and sponsored by b or or build your own robot yeah they've got new tutorials on their website really fun stuff you can actually build a robot in just a few minutes with this kit and write and sponsored by the fabulous items that you can get on eco where you're wearing a new sweatshirt absolutely nice and nice and warm warm for the fall yeah i mean the thing that i about these t-shirts is that a lot of times people come up to me and they go what is that shirt and you can immediately start a conversation about whatever it is so that's the thing that i and the other thing that i about these items is that everything is a hundred percent carbon offset from the manufacturing to the shipping to the entire lifecycle of your shirt you putting it in the washing machine and finally getting rid of it at the end of its life all of that is carbon offset and on top of that one tree is planted for every order which makes it extremely carbon negative jesse mm-hmm this is the easiest change you can make okay what is it we've been telling everyone on this all the time about switching to electric cars getting solar on the roof maybe even going vegan to make a difference in climate change and a lot of people do this a lot of people have made the switch to an electric car or they go solar but more people than that have said that is too much for me i you know going vegan is too hard getting an electric car is too expensive for me and going solar you know i can't do it my wife won't let me well there's a very simple easy change you can make that will probably bring about the biggest impact on the environment that you'll ever make and it'll only take you about 30 minutes so we tell you all the time on the show that you should vote with your wallet that'll make a change in the environment right you go to a store you buy from companies that are green that care about the environment and that will take your money away from companies that aren't green that's great this is going to have an impact on the companies and in turn that'll have an impact on how they behave but you also spend money when you're not spending money what yeah unless you keep all your money in your mattress you have a bank account right right yeah they have way better vaults than my mattress yeah i mean banks make a lot of sense they safely hold your money and they allow you to move it all around and do stuff with it but they don't really keep it all in a vault you know that right well then where is it you're you're thinking of this place all wrong is if i have the money back on a safe the money's not here well your money's in joe's house yeah it's it's loaned out to people and businesses which is great but there's one problem okay what's that what if your bank is lending out money to companies that you don't believe in okay who well check out this list from bank trac org it's from their banking on climate change 2019 report that they put out every year showing how much banks invest in fossil fuels because i know that fossil fuel companies are not something that you're really big on right no i'm definitely not but wait wait a minute what are the why are these banks giving money to fossil fuel companies okay so let's take a step back for a second how do banks make money fees they do make money from fees uh-huh but banks make most their money by loaning your money out and getting interest on those loans but then why do you fossil fuel companies need loans aren't they already rich well fossil fuel companies have to continually explore for new wells they have to buy drilling equipment they have to build pipelines and refineries and ships and etc don't they just pump more money out of the ground well it's not solar or wind where you build a wind farm or a solar farm and then the energy just keeps flowing day in day out oil and coal and natural gas are a finite resource you drill and you pump and soon that well is depleted and you have to move on to more drilling and more pumping and you constantly need more money for that so banks loan them the money to keep them running exactly but what if they didn't awesome i'm gonna call my bank you're gonna do what wait what what do you do you're calling your bank there they're not gonna take you seriously hang on that hang up there they're not gonna what are you gonna tell them take my money out of fossil fuels yeah no no they're not gonna listen to you who are they gonna listen to they're gonna listen to these guys i don't i don't get it okay know what they're gonna listen if you take your money out of your bank and put it into a bank that invests in what you want that's the only way they're gonna listen okay so what bank is that jpmorgan hang on wells fargo no citibank no bank of america td bank no morgan stanley no okay so not a us bank let's try bank of montreal nope deutsche bank no sent ender no ubs no hsbc okay so basically you're said you're saying that there's no banks i'm just gonna call up mattress firm we you're gonna call a mattress company yeah i'm just gonna i'm just gonna keep my money in a mattress that seems to be the only way hold on hold on there are a few banks there's a group called partnership for carbon accounting financials and they started in 2017 the partnership is to standardize carbon accounting for the financial sector and they have announced more than 50 financial institutions worldwide representing two point nine trillion dollars in assets that have committed themselves to assess and disclose the greenhouse gas emissions of their loans and investments okay so how does this help me well there are banks around the world that have agreed to follow these principles so that you can keep your money in the banks that aren't loaning your money to fossil fuel companies okay so what banks how do i find them well p caf has a list of member banks and we posted links to them by country in the show notes below i've done some research into the uspsa f banks and i'm gonna start moving my accounts to amalgamated bank this week they're a bank that actually seems to care about the things that i care about and i just want to point out if you most bank websites there's usually a page about us and you go to that and there's lots of friendly looking people that are we to help the world with our bank but what's nice about this list we just talked about is it's actually showing you where your money's going in terms of fossil fuels and that's really powerful yeah so i want to be clear the banks on the pca f list it doesn't mean they're 100 percent fossil fuel free it just means that they disclose what they invest in so that you can actually take a look at it and decide if it's right for you interesting okay okay i know what most of you're feeling right now because we're in the same boat setting up a bank account is going to the dentist for us the thought of filling out forums and looking up account numbers and all that is not very appealing but a few minutes of work and you're done and then every day your money is working for clean energy instead of against it because as we speak i bet most of us have our money tucked away in banks that are happily loaning our money to big oil coal plants are buying new machinery with our money oil companies are fracking with our money we don't get to check a box on our bank account to tell our banks how we feel we have to tell them how we feel just we do it with every other corporation by voting with our money and in this case we have to take our money out and bring it to a bank that operates responsibly there are tens of thousands of people watching this right now and if we all take a few minutes check the list down below find a bank and move our money that could easily be half a billion dollars worth of money moved from fossil fuel investment to renewable half a billion dollars what are you crazy no i just did some math let's say 50,000 people watch this uh-huh and let's say they have $10,000 that they move out of their bank to a responsible bank fifty thousand times ten thousand is half a billion dollars do you think everyone's could be moving ten thousand dollars out of their bank well the average savings for an american is sixteen thousand dollars so i kind of went under the average savings so i mean if we use that number we're talking about eight hundred million dollars yeah from this yeah we're not starting a campaign with with headquarters and adjust this alone yeah if everyone watching would do that we would move 500 to 800 million dollars out of fossil fuels banking into renewable banking wow now you don't think that bankers around the world would take note of that and then get this what if you shared this and tens of thousands more do it because let's be real it's pretty easy to do and get and it's free to do this that's a good point i mean so many things that we talk about on the show or whether it's you know buying an electric car or getting solar on your house it's gonna cost you something right you're gonna have to or even switching to veganism it's oh well you're gonna have to change your diet completely this is free to do because it's your money and it's instead of giving it to someone you're giving it to someone who's gonna give it back to you because it's a bank right now i think a lot of people are sitting there going changing banks i don't think i can do that because it used to be the only way that you could bank with a bank was it had to have a physical location near your home but today banks can be virtual right i mean i'm a part of a local bank but i haven't been to the bank in five years right there's there's mobile deposits for my checks so i can just take a picture with my phone app there's you know direct deposit from work there's atms they're all on the network i have checks i can move things digitally i don't ever have to go to the bank and talk to them ever right banking is no longer limited by location so i posit that in one week from the release of this today it's easily possible that if we all get off our butts you know to get off your butt oh what i'm doing it right now you changing your bank from your phone yeah well that's that's true okay so yeah if we all do this and we share this we could easily move a billion dollars out of the fossil fuel companies pockets and into the renewable energy companies pockets one week 1 billion dollars and so if after a week or two with your new bank you tell some co-workers at lunch and some family members that you personally could help move millions of dollars more now what if all the climate strike marchers just changed their bank remember how four million people marched a few weeks ago what if all those people who were marching took half an hour at lunch and moved their bank accounts to pca f banks that could easily be sixty four billion dollars moved out of fossil fuels hands and into wind and solar and renewable energy that's equivalent to how much jpmorgan chase the biggest fossil fuel bank loaned to big oil and coal last year so we're gonna stop right now so that you can go do it comment below what bank you chose and share this so that more people will see it and just so that we can have a number at the end of this we're gonna make a google form that you can go fill out so go change your bank on the google form fill out which bank you left which bank you move to and how much money you moved it is completely anonymous don't worry and then we're gonna have a number right of large proportions if you all do it so this is the this is probably the easiest the simplest the cheapest thing that you can do for no money you're you're just moving your banks that's the that's it your money will be working for you day-in day-out as you sleep for the right causes now instead of all these years for the wrong causes thank you so much for joining us i really urge you to go do that share this with someone else so that they'll do it to tell everyone you know about it and we'll be making a huge huge difference i want to give a huge shout out to j-hat just have a think youtube where we got the idea for this show i urge you to go check out their on this where they go much more in-depth into it and while you're watching this at the end here and you're thinking to yourself should i which i can do that that sounds work it's not that much work you'll on a link you'll find a bank you'll fill out a couple forms you do every day for a million other things and before you know it you'll have switched your bank not a big deal i know it sounds a big deal for some of you maybe you've been with that bank for your whole life and you're oh my god what do they think doesn't matter just some numbers being moved from one place to another in the world but what does matter is that those banks will start using your money appropriately thank you so much for watching now you know",0

hundred blades for free if you use the code now you know at checkout this episode is about a problem that we think tesla currently has and one which we think could get much worse this year if you watch this at all you know that zach and i are the biggest tesla fans in the world we have traveled across the country and covered practically every tesla event for the past six years we've worked hard to get more butts in seats and quite frankly sell more teslas than anyone so much so that one of the number one questions we get is do you work for tesla heck we've dedicated practically every waking hour to help tesla with their mission to advance evs and sustainable energy by doing this show and tesla time news every week for the past seven years but you know this when your best friend is having trouble when your best friend might be making a big mistake it's hard it doesn't usually go down well but sometimes you have to say something say something okay so i want this to go up in big text on screen because i don't want anyone to miss this zach and jesse love tesla period in the spirit of love and wishing the best for tesla we think it's necessary to share a shortcoming that we have seen for some time and we think is going to get worse we know tesla has the ability to fix this problem and feel confident that elon and tesla would want to fix it if they only knew about it it is out of our love and respect for everything tesla does that we are sharing our thoughts with you today okay so are we clear we are not here to bash tesla if you want that kind of content there are plenty of other places on the internet you can go we are tesla fans fanboys bulls whatever you want to call us but that said we are not cult members we do not blindly follow if there is a problem you know us we speak up we have done it plenty of times in the past so this episode should be no shocker okay so what are we talking about here we're talking about something that in our opinion has been hit or miss with tesla for a long time tesla service we're not talking about the cars themselves i think that they are designed and built really well we're talking about if you own a tesla and you have some kind of problem as all cars are going to have from time to time whether it's something that's the driver's fault curb rashing the wheel or bumping into something and breaking off a side view mirror or something that goes wrong with the car a door handle stops or a blower vent that stops working properly cars need service it's just a fact unlike some items that you own that only live for a year or two before they become obsolete or break unfixably cars especially evs last a long time tesla's motors are rated at a million miles don't forget so over the years the seasons the thousands of miles the potholes they are going to need fixing from time to time so when that day comes that something isn't working right with your tesla and you need to schedule an appointment the way you do it today is you open up your tesla app you hit the service button and you answer a couple questions you type in a little text maybe attach a photo and you hit send tesla then schedules either a mobile ranger to come out to you or schedules for you to bring your tesla to your nearest tesla service center okay in theory that sounds great in fact it sounds amazing i mean i haven't owned an ice car in years but we both own nissan leafs and we have tons of friends and acquaintances who own ice cars and i've never heard of such an easy way to schedule a service i mean a mobile service fan that will drive up to your work or house and fix your car zach and jesse what are you complaining about in theory and in most cases this is amazing this is a way better way to handle service than the competition but here's the problem both jesse and i have been bringing our teslas in for service for years now since 2016 and we have seen how the system really works this isn't a gotcha i would say usually tesla service has worked pretty well yeah i'd say about half the time tesla service has done what's advertised and in some cases gone above and beyond many of the service techs and customer support reps we've worked with are outstanding people what we're about to share with you is not a gripe session we are doing this episode because we have a platform that people listen to and we are honestly hoping that by sharing our experiences thoughts and solutions that the people at tesla that need to hear about this we'll hear about it and get it fixed even if that means some people may need to be fired problem number one in my opinion is that tesla does not have enough service centers in certain parts of the world now we live in new england that's near boston in the great state of massachusetts massachusetts even though it's a rather small state not huge california or texas we actually have one of the highest concentrations of teslas in the world that's right if you look at tesla's per capita massachusetts is right up there at the top of the list as of june 2021 massachusetts had over 21 000 evs registered in the state most of those being teslas and yet we have currently only three tesla service centers in massachusetts now i know i know we should be happy right i mean we just got our third one up in peabody just a year ago we've been waiting for that one for about two and a half years by the way from when it was announced so i'm grateful and i know for some of you tesla owners who have had to drive for hours across state lines to get to a service center you're probably jumping up and down right now yelling what are you complaining about but let's take a look at some numbers if you drive an ice car in the u.s if you were one of the 275 million people driving an ice car then you have about 234 thousand service stations to choose from on average that means for every 1180 ice cars there is a service station in other words if tomorrow every ice car in the country needed service on average you'd have about 1 180 cars in line to get service so let's do the math here in massachusetts with let's say 20 000 teslas and three tesla service centers that's 6667 tesla's per service center and wait what's that oh i hear ya i know that there are also tesla mobile rangers and i know i wasn't counting them yet but we don't have that many of them we estimate about six in our state they only operate out of two of the service centers and let me tell you even though i think they're great i mean their mobile techs are second to none and i can't imagine how they do it through sweltering heat and blistering cold but they are mobile so they have to drive to each appointment which means they can only see so many customers per day no matter how efficiently they try to plan we'll get to more of that in a minute so i would only count all the mobile techs in the state at best as the equivalent to another service center so let's do the math again this time saying that there are four tesla service centers in massachusetts that comes out to 20 000 teslas divided by four and you get uh one service center for every five thousand cars and what was that ice car average again uh one for every one thousand one hundred eighty now i'm a tesla fan boy i'm an early adopter and i was totally willing to put up with a less than stellar service center arrangement in the beginning i mean let's be honest tesla had some tight financial quarters a few times so i know money had to be spent where it had to be spent but if i'm not mistaken tesla has a fair chunk of cash in the bank now yeah about 16 billion dollars and i think now would be a good time to spend it on more service centers because there are more tesla's coming yeah so far tesla has produced a little over 2 million cars 2022 is now here and tesla could quite possibly produce 2 million more cars this year so that would double the number of teslas on the road in the next 12 months so taking our little massachusetts as a microcosm of the world that could mean that by the end of this year there could be forty thousand teslas on the roads here in massachusetts and still only three but we'll say four service centers to repair them but zack hang on maybe you're blowing this all out of proportion i mean maybe when you visit a tesla service station today in massachusetts it's completely empty uh no jesse and i regularly visit all the service centers and we hear from a ton of friends and fans in new england and they are always packed to the gills you cannot usually even find a parking space the last time i went to peabody for example for service on sparky i drove around the lot twice couldn't find a space so i pulled up to an employee and asked and they told me to park in front of the garage doors which effectively blocked it in i followed his directions and then i heard another employee a few minutes later curse under his breath as he opened the door to pull out a car from the bay and i was blocking him in it's that bad the waiting rooms are always packed and you can't get an appointment usually for weeks so let's do the math again assuming four service stations at the end of this year and 40 000 teslas and by the way if there was a new service station in the works we'd have heard about it because the last time tesla was planning one the pbd location we mentioned before it took tesla two and a half years to open it and we heard about it through our contacts the whole time but here's the math forty thousand tesla's divided by four service centers and that's gonna be one service center for every 10 000 teslas or in elon terms that's an order of magnitude 10 times worse than ice car service station ratios no matter how good the system the employees the logistics you can't make up for just the sheer number of technicians and lifts that you need to handle that many cars and this is the first part of the problem i believe that tesla being a silicon valley tech startup they might believe that you can tech your way out of the problem the app the mobile rangers the computer updates they are all amazing but at the end of the day you need people service techs with screwdrivers and wrenches to solve most car problems and tesla i'm telling you you don't have nearly enough of them here's the problem i don't think that elon knows he has a problem look at jesse and i for example according to data from tesla we are probably counted as happy customers but we're not and to illustrate this let's just talk about a few of our recent service encounters so right before the new year i went out to dinner with sparky and the family after dinner we went out to the car to drive home and one of the rear seats wouldn't slide back all the way i fussed with it i searched youtube and the forums i rebooted i couldn't fix it so i opened my app and put in my service request a mobile service visit was scheduled for a few days later january 4th great i thought then a couple days later on december 31st it was rescheduled but wait it was rescheduled for the same time and date january 4th so i was confused but whatever still says january 4th so great i only have to live with my second row seat not allowing someone to sit in it for a few days whatever yeah whatever but then january 4th comes and goes and no service tech arrives the service appointment just gets cancelled in my app without any warning then a day later on january 5th i get an email saying my service appointment is now scheduled for january 31st at the dedham service center wait so more than a month after you put in the request and now you have to go drive down there yep and i didn't reschedule it in fact we have to record a tesla time news that day and here's the thing i've been around long enough to know what's really going on i think that original mobile service call looks to tesla on their data spreadsheet i'm a happy customer i put in a request a few days later mobile tech scheduled the second scheduling mysteriously popping up after my mobile tech was scheduled makes it look a second service appointment so from tesla's perspective when all is said and done it will look they handle two problems in one month even though nothing's been solved yet i could go on but i'm interested in your latest service appointment jesse so back in october i was driving through some heavy downpours at one point through a moderately sized puddle the next morning i go for a drive and immediately i notice a scraping noise so i pull into a cul-de-sac i diagnose the problem small piece of the underbody arrow cover that covers my rear drive unit was ripped probably water or a tree branch ripped it and it's hanging down scraping the ground so i get some duct tape and i immediately put in my service request through the app it's scheduled for three weeks off okay fine the tape should hold at least until then so a few days before my appointment i get a message through my app hey jesse we can do this with a mobile service visit great great i save myself a trip so i text back that sounds awesome except now the service appointment is scheduled for december 2nd that's another three weeks away so i go put some more duct tape on and i wait december 2nd rolls around and the service tech arrives in the mobile van and immediately tells me that he can't fix anything under the car meaning that my arrow cover is not going to get fixed wait what but i'd put in the service request and somebody sent a mobile service fan but he says don't worry he'll reschedule me an appointment i say well fair enough it's not his faults obviously but no appointment gets made or rescheduled so i messaged service to call me because i was starting to get upset that this has happened and i was worried because i had approved 200 for a quote for that mobile service tech to come out i got a very brief statement saying that i wouldn't be charged and then the appointment was closed i couldn't message back i could leave feedback and i did left my phone number contact me this is serious that wouldn't get back to me so now i have to go making a new appointment so now a full month off january 5th so i get a message from tesla peabody we're sorry they apologize for my mobile appointment which is a nice gesture but it doesn't address any of the questions that i have about why that happened after this point everything goes smoothly i bring it in they fix it took them an hour but for the five minutes i was waiting there to drop off my car the guy ahead of me in line in the waiting room talks to the tech says i'm here to drop off my car uh the tech goes all right what's your last name yeah you're uh you're not on my list here for today you're scheduled for nine days from now the guy's that's that's weird because i definitely scheduled it for today this is not some ruffian guy this is he's wearing a suit for goodness sake i think he understands what his schedule looks and he goes you know i really wouldn't have scheduled it for that day because i'm only available wednesday mornings and so the tech says that he'd love to help him out but that they're down a bunch of texts and they can't help him out today and then he reschedules him for three weeks away this guy probably already waited three weeks to have this appointment okay so you heard that jesse and i both had recent tesla service problems we're two youtubers who get to use our platform to complain about our first world problems poor you but because of our community we hear from thousands of people every month emails comments polls and we ask people all the time about your experience with the car most of the time you report back that your experiences are amazing i want to stress this we are not looking to create problems that don't exist or blow problems out of proportion but for instance we asked on our most recent monthly patreon live stream that's where we hang out with our patrons and discuss all sorts of fun topics we just put it out there hey tell us about your recent tesla service experience and we heard from annie up in maine whose closest tesla service center is peabody massachusetts it's three hours away at first she was lucky to have a mobile ranger drive up to her and that's great but he had to drive three hours to reach her one way you can't tell me that's an efficient way to handle service long term just as an aside here there are no tesla service centers in maine new hampshire or vermont now look i get it there are only about 2 000 evs in maine 2700 in new hampshire and only about 2 300 in vermont but tesla you need to open a service center in each of those states first of all if you want to have people seriously consider buying a tesla in one of those three states you have to have a service center there secondly for many northern massachusetts residents a quick trip up to say manchester new hampshire would be quicker than a trip down through boston traffic to dedham so you'd effectively be helping service in massachusetts as well thirdly you can't have annie who relies on her car to drive three hours one way to go to peabody only to be told when she gets there here's an uber voucher to get home are you kidding me see this is the silicon valley problem right here not everywhere in the country has uber availability and even in peabody where there are some ubers annie had to wait an hour just for an uber to get to her at the service center what the and you didn't even have a loaner for her she just traveled from maine and then what she's gonna call for an uber in the middle of maine hey pick me up there's no one coming what is this going to do for your reputation tesla annie is a super nice person she made a day of it and she visited salem for a getaway most people are not annie they will be so upset if they get treated this way they will put it on their social media they will tell their friends and family how poorly they were treated and you know what this will have a huge impact on future sales if people hear that you can't get your tesla fixed promptly that will become your reputation tesla up until now it's largely been early adopters us buying teslas and we all know that early adopters have a much higher tolerance for this kind of thing but regular people they will not tolerate bad service the last three times we were at peabody we heard from tesla employees the first time i was told when i complained about the long time i'd been waiting for my car to get fixed yeah i'm so sorry we've had a bunch of techs not come in i assumed it was a covid related thing and i understood hey i get it you know but that was three months ago then we were up there a couple times in the last two months and we got oh i'm so sorry for the delay but we're having a hard time finding qualified service technicians now hang on i again understand a couple weeks even a month where kovid related stuff throws off your whole game but now i'm hearing you just can't find qualified techs for months i'm sorry but that's something way bigger it's either incompetence of management or management with its hands tied because of wages tesla look you need to do whatever you need to do to get a lot of qualified techs and i want to take a little side here i think that a lot of people point to tesla employees getting tesla stock and i think that's awesome but i think you have to understand that in different places in the country different um cultures think of it differently and i think if you're a tech and you're you're not gonna get a very good hourly wage but or you're gonna get tesla stock i'm sorry a lot of tax who aren't into tesla might be yeah i don't want the stock i want the pay and if you're not i'm a stock guru guy getting stock is not a big present for you it's kind of a big hassle oh now i have to understand oh i have to get an account i have to have a brokerage um that's a huge bunch of questions that uh some service techs might not want to have to jump through and imagine they come home and they're honey i got that new job at tesla and you got a pay decrease from bmw right people might not that they might not understand that the stock is super valuable or it might be really hard for them to exercise those options and look i want to go back to the app the tesla app is great but when it comes to servicing a car there are times when you need to talk to a person annie's case is a perfect example someone at tesla in three minutes could learn that annie needs her car she lives in maine she'll need a loner i know that many millennials me and jen's ears are very happy to never speak to anyone on the phone and that's fine but a lot of people buying these rather expensive cars will be older and they should at least have the choice to speak to a thoughtful experienced empowered tesla employee who can probably solve more problems and will give customers a sense that they are being cared for now look i know you really don't want this job jesse but if i were vp of special operations at tesla i would be going into tesla service centers undercover hey everybody uh what's going on i'm just a regular customer you i would be presenting a run-of-the-mill service problem with my car and talking to employees and other customers in the waiting room finding out what their pain points are what worked for them i would be identifying the logistics problems the stupid decisions that have a cascading effect you know i would be striving to make every customer so incredibly happy with their experience just they are with the car itself but you know what i experience when i'm in the waiting room i hear from people who don't know things about their cars why won't my car connect to wi-fi in my driveway my handle seems to get frozen stuck is that supposed to happen have a support line where they can call with helpful happy tesla employees who can answer these problems and expand the knowledge base and make sure those people on the phone actually drive teslas because what i can't stand is many of the techs and service center people still don't drive their own teslas so they don't get the cars i mean they can fix them but if you don't drive them every day then you just don't get the little things about the cars and that's a really good point and that's another thing i would fix i would have some cars there the loaners the techs can take home it's another perk of the job and it would make them experts i would do that for the sales people too but that's another topic and here's another thing i would change if i were in charge of tesla i know this is going to be controversial but instead of pushing out every last car at the end of every quarter to new customers and look i want everyone waiting for tesla to get their tesla as soon as possible but instead of doing that make enough parts and get those parts distributed around the world to all the service centers so that they are waiting for them when customers come in with problems we spoke with our buddy graham in australia he has been waiting for a replacement side view mirror for his tesla since november come on tesla you have the data you know how many customers are going to need what part you probably have that data down to the bolt sorry wrong wrong word down to the nut and washer so why not prioritize having those parts on hand before they're needed rather than after it would make such a difference and speed up service times by so much and if you just had one big quarter where you said we made a whole bunch of parts that would last for years because then you could be doing the little piddly amounts that you've been doing up until this point and you'd be able to maintain it so basically instead of an extra 3 000 cars last quarter being delivered take those parts and distribute them you don't need every last car sold you did a few quarters ago tesla it's just so short-sighted look i know you can't quantify what we're talking about here i know there's no easy way to count a future happy customer you can count a car delivery but i'm telling you that even though you can't count it it will count a happy customer who doesn't have to wait for a month to get their car fixed may not immediately post on social media but i can promise you that a disgruntled customer who does have to wait or gets rescheduled too many times is going to one day snap and say screw this tesla service sucks i'm not going to buy a tesla again and i'm going to tell all my friends about my experience i can point to youtubers who have started as tesla fans and now are tesla haters why because they felt mistreated you cannot take a silicon valley look down your nose approach to customer service and unfortunately tesla in many parts of the world you have hired people who are not the right fit they care more about faking their metrics and padding their resumes than they do about the most important thing customer satisfaction or you've given them no choice you've basically made it so that the system will only work if you pad numbers and that's not good and if you need proof that what we're talking about is real take this story from the drive about a tesla model 3 performance that was delivered with the missing brake pad we've researched the story and it seems pretty legit april gilmore took delivery of her model 3 performance on december 19th and noticed a worrying scraping sound coming from her rear driver's side wheel when she braked she contacted tesla service on december 20th and was told there was no appointments available for three weeks she then recorded this and she sent that to her tesla service advisor only to be told the breaks sound normal for a tesla performance model 3. she then visited an independent local tesla shop which i assume there i mean there are no such things that i know of so i assume she went to her local you know break place and there the technician removed the wheel and discovered the missing brake pad is that it only after she sent in that did her tesla service center invite her in now i'm just gonna read here from the drive article at the time of service gilmore says tesla had no loner to offer her one has since been given albeit with expired tags and instead supplied her with uber credits to use as her car was at the shop over a holiday weekend she didn't have the chance to check in until december 27th when she was told the parts were on order and that her car was expected to be ready on the 31st that day her car's eta was pushed back to january 7th on which date she was told parts still weren't available and that her car was being delayed to january 14th as a result it was at this point gilmore asked about having her car bought back to which the tesla service manager responded by offering to cover a payment she accepted the offer but also requested tesla reimburse her for the 100 inspection at an independent shop tesla has since delayed her car's completion yet again though this time by only five days to january 19th she says i have never purchased a new or used vehicle that was under warranty and had this type of experience with the service department i absolutely do not trust the tesla brand in any way not only did they deliver a car to me that was unsafe to drive but they also blew me off about the noise the car was making and now they're dragging their feet on making things right if they can build and ship new model 3ps then why can't they repair the ones that they've already sold to people i had no clue that tesla treated their customers this way prior to this experience she went on to say i'm going to see how things play out and whether or not tesla tries to make this right after all this i cannot fathom that they would give me the car back with any issues but i'm definitely unsure how i feel about keeping it or if i even want it back at this point i've lost days of my life to dealing with their mistake and their issues so making a move to another brand of car is looking a good idea and i don't blame her one bit and then the drive finished their article by saying since tesla no longer has a media relations department the drive was unable to reach out to the automaker for comment yes it's it's so interesting that tesla doesn't have a pr department but this is kind of where you'd want one that's another we've already made so you can go watch that if you want i mean april's experience is only out of the ordinary because they didn't install a brake pad that's the only thing that makes it different from any other service experience that we've kind of been through and look i mean i can even give tesla a pass i know you can't but i can give tesla a pass on messing up something at the factory these things are going to happen no i won't take that i don't think that you can you should ship out especially model 3 performance without a rear brake pad and i get it i mean look it is better than sending out say an ice car because you have regen breaking so that's nice you can at least be slowing down i guess what i'm saying is i can understand mistakes do happen what i'm saying is that they were compounded here by the fact that she reported the problem to tesla immediately instead of them taking it seriously and saying well of course let us send a ranger out there look a ranger could have solved this problem they can pop a wheel off they can fix a brake pad that's easy they didn't so that kind of makes you not believe in the ranger service secondly though they could have said of course bring it on in they didn't they blew her off they or they could have told her why don't you take it to an independent shop why did she have to make that decision why and then she had you know she spent a hundred dollars to have someone basically take her wheel off and look at the brake caliper notice that there was no pad and she has to now get that reimbursed from tesla then on top of it when tesla actually accepts the problem and has the car in for service now you experience weeks of waiting for your car for something as simple as a brake pad and a you know few brake parts because this case while anomalous because you know missing brake pad from the factory the experience with tesla service is so reminiscent of something that a lot of people that we've talked to have faced and this points to a system that is on the verge of collapse basically you have tesla service and they don't have enough resources it's so blatantly obvious and so i don't want to be pointing fingers at people at the service department how dare they don't treat alice with the proper respect and and take her car in they're packed they're booked they don't have enough service centers we talked about how there's 5 000 cars per service center but of course we didn't count new hampshire maine and vermont right so you're adding an extra let's say 6 000 onto that that just made it worse it's making it it's already at 6 000. it's going to be getting higher and higher this problem will only get worse as there are more teslas out on the road tesla needs to make a serious effort to increase their service budget dramatically and i would love it if our feedback surveys were being listened to trust me we've reached up through the ranks to find out where the problem is but we don't have the power to get to the bottom of it or do anything about it i don't think that anyone at tesla is going to do anything about this besides elon because they're not empowered to now listen if you're upset about this we are we urge you to tweet this to elon i want us to be the vps of special operations i want to find out where the problems are we will get to the bottom of it we will solve it and we will do it all for free because we love tesla now you know what to do thanks so much for watching now you know we work hard to bring you videos about things that

Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJl35aIy5pOVBHvoGgqavrdJ,4Kj-SN1NRMY,zach and i began testing full self-driving beta at the beginning of this year and we found the experience to be a bit pleased damn it stressful tighter tighter tighter yeah no god that took go i'm doing it no that was ridiculous bro what the hell was that oh my gosh wow let it let it do it let it do it look at it let's just see how

self driving we thought that it might be helpful to actually have some body monitors to see how we were reacting to full self driving oh my god if we had me hooked up to we have to get a blood pressure sensor yeah we have to we have to and so when peter hartzbeck the founder and ceo of imotions reached out to us and told us that he had some testing equipment and that he would love for us to try it out we headed down to boston to imotion's lab to meet up with nom their senior neuroscientist project specialist who's going to help me get strapped in and test out full self driving while gathering valuable data at the same time just to let you know you're already wearing six thousand dollars seven thousand dollars worth of equipment so just let's say you're affecting the results look at that you're stressing out look at that it's going up wow as you can see my stress monitoring is already working so you can do things to artificially kind of do that so if you do a cough and then you just wait you can see that oh wow whoa wait that made me sweat more so it's just an autonomic response and so the blue at the top is showing my heart rate and that green graph at the bottom is showing my gsr i'll have nom explain what gsr is galvanic skin response or electrodermal activity is sort of the larger term for it is it instantaneous to when jessie feels something actually it's not so it takes a little while for the stimulus or the event to get processed by the visual system and then kind of go into your brain and then actually then go back down to your skin to actually be expressed as sweat so it takes about four to six seconds typically for that reaction to occur from say the onset of an event yeah that's right sweaty palms is an actual stress response and science can measure it [music] also if you look at my hand you know oh yeah wow there's jessie's eyes moving on top of heart rate and gsr the other tool we're using is eye tracking the pair of glasses i'm wearing tracks my eyes and knows where i'm looking it records this data and shows it on screen with the little circle the tiny little cameras here that's what's tracking my eye in there see that tiny camera it's a little camera here a little camera there and then this is the camera that sees what i'm looking at can you track my eyes so nom hooked me into the sensors it was time to test out not only tesla's full self-driving beta around boston but also my own stress level [music] so uh what do you got there oh just eight thousand dollar pair of glasses oh no it's not even the expensive ones these aren't oddly enough just getting out of the garage was a fairly stressful affair we're already off to a stressful start here welcome to boston welcome to boston all right [music] so jesse you're going gonna drive us on the first leg okay so it's jesse human driver on the first leg as zach said i'll be driving the first leg as a control and then full self-driving beta will be taking the same route again all right so i'm approaching this would be hard for the for the fsd to do because it's a stopped mail truck and it might not know but you knew i knew to sail right around that thing i think one of the interesting things that we're going to see from the eye tracking data is what i can see because it's limited to where my eyes are pointed whereas the car should be able to see everything that it can see and that should be a roughly 360 degree view now can i go right here no i have to go left [music] i'm thinking so much more about where my eyes are looking at that guy's shampoo bottle in his back pocket interesting okay so i'm gonna need to get over it's there no i didn't need to get over great and do i need to get back over you'll need to take a left do i need to be in the left lane uh i think both lanes are okay no i'm wrong you gotta be in the left lane okay great stress is good stress is good ah driving in boston huge stress response when i get into the wrong lane and i realize it then when zack tells me i'm in the wrong lane my stress pops up again getting on stero drive this is a way to get to faneuil hall i'm flabbergasted how many stop signs do you need before i actually see it i totally wasn't looking i'm gonna i'm gonna go this guy's not looking at me good check that out and that's why i drive a test [music] how you doing stress guy i mean seriously the car isn't even driving so this is just boston so this is the control this is the control see here i don't know which lane to be in because i'm supposed to be in the middle lane but there's four five four lanes yeah i think you'll probably want to be over another lane eventually but oh right 93 south to quincy i didn't think this was a way to do it it's really not but this is this is good it's adding to the stress this is this is tourist level yeah and we tried to get the faneuil home myself stressful are they gonna let me in [music] so stay in this lane i think because you're going to take the airport yeah yeah yeah and you'll have choice between government center and airport and i'm pretty sure you're going to choose government center yeah unless you want to go to the airport we can see it's a whole nother level stressed out i got it in the airport [music] so what do you think what are the chances that uh fsd beta the latest version that we have is gonna be able to do it not perfectly but no but do it well ish what do you think pretty close to zero okay close to zero so how many interventions do you think you're going to do 25 25 oh okay i think maybe we should be talking about percentage of the of the trip that's going to be oh segway tour there we go they still do those so you think about 25 interventions i'm going to go 10 okay i think it won't be that bad [music] you can see from the graph that i have been getting fairly relaxed as we have been driving on the greenway in boston but i'm about to take a wrong turn and nom corrects me what i'll move that way don't go that way oh okay huge stress response as i have to take over quickly okay how's your stress it's pretty pretty high hey so i just noticed that you planned out our route uh we're using waypoints yeah so we're going all around boston here it's it's giving us a nice little taste of some city driving ish i know that i'm gonna have to take over a bunch of times there's no way that it's going to do it at least that's my prediction i mean because lanes you have to be you're in the right lane and you're never in the right lane even me driving you saw me last time and i was having a terrible time of it [music] all right so uh tesla is driving yeah how you doing taking a deep breath relax this year yeah no it should be should be okay um it's nice to almost feel i can look around a little bit so i saw those bicyclists coming from the screen i wasn't even able to kind of see the mirrors or anything that okay so here we go here we go green light i'm gonna just okay so now we're in the middle of the intersection there's a stopped car right there what's it gonna do let it do it i'm gonna take that wasn't a problem yet it would have figured it out no it's i'm not that's one yeah that's one that's one i'm i'm anytime it's going to do something that's really i just don't think is is you have no faith no you're absolutely right it knows to take the right that's good we have a green light take it oh that's very well done oh it's very tight on the right okay corrected how you doing so far i don't know it's just it just doesn't drive the way that i want to you know it just it's it's very i don't know if safe is the right word oh that was so tight and not smooth a lot of this not smoothness is what i don't and there's on the other side of this truck is a hand cart yeah i'm going to be ready to take over i'd love to see what it does though and we're just letting everyone go today yeah we're nice teslas are nice as soon as it's ready to go go go go go go go little gas go go go would it hit the hand cart no it didn't it didn't nice okay it did stop all right that was that was a number two i just i just look i there's not a lot of room for error whoa okay hello it's i can go 26 miles an hour there's no potholes on this road how you doing there it's it is i feel it's more stressful but because i just i'm not in control this is what i have a problem with with roller coasters i can do crazy stuff if i'm in a thing that allows me to do it i get into a plane simulator one of those things that goes upside down i don't care i'm upside down all the time i mean obviously it's not giving me the same g-forces but i just feel if i had control then it would be more enjoyable for me and it's that relention of autonomy religion i that word it's not a word religion always put religion definition look it up look it up i bet it's a thing i bet it's not religion it's going i'm giving it some gas i'm giving it some that's a crazy turn oh oh what's it gonna do here oh hey oh oh hey hey hey hey you did it so the car in the intersection there's a bicyclist on my right what's this guy gonna do is he gonna go here i go wow yeah well done that's what i would have done well done i would have taken control of the situation and gone through there so i appreciate that you think it handled that well i think it handled that remarkably well for how odd a situation that that was so now we have a truck that's kind of parked in our lane just a little [applause] see i feel when i'm driving i'm not doing as many deep breaths and and stress control i feel i'm doing more of it now okay so here's the trailer park truck how's it going to do oh excellent that was very good i'm very impressed very good that was really because it has to take a right let's see just do it it wants to do it yeah nice work wow this is much better yeah can i just say this version's much better much better okay this is stressful because those people are actually going and i don't think they should unless we're all just supposed to merge okay i took over there i just didn't trust that i mean it probably would have handled it fine it's just yeah the van was cutting in the van was cutting in and all that other fine oh it's very confused yeah what are we doing here it thinks that we can't go straight if it tries to take this right turn i will take over i think that that's gonna i think well i'm gonna stop it okay i'm gonna give it the opportunity to figure that out okay go oh it's corrected it did it it corrected it did it nice work it felt it was going into that lane and i feel i actually pulled it but it didn't take it out okay we're gonna be getting in the correct lane hopefully blinker cutting off the bmw that's always good take a take a bit of that our speed limit is a little low i mean technically this is a 25. it's a bit of a break check on that oh parking car parking car okay is it gonna do what it's gonna do i think we're doing the right thing here just waiting for it or is it gonna get into it we should definitely go around at this point but i mean the beamers going around us so that guy does not know how to park rhode island oh come on rhode island do you need some help do you want me to get out and park it for you oh what's tess doing here we're giving him the old boston look we were doing the right thing mr rhode island over there was not uh by the way i offer a parking class uh it's called it's called the adult park here if you can't park don't park they do not know how to parallel park no don't pretend they don't even get close i don't even try to parallel park most of the time [music] all right kind of dumping it in the deep end here oh that would have been that would have been an accident with another tesla getting on stero drive is always tricky and full self-driving beta seemed to not see the car coming up on our left or possibly didn't see that we needed to merge as you can see from the data my heart rate was going up as we were approaching the on-ramp and i had a huge gsr spike as i realized that i needed to take over again the gsr is slightly delayed because of how long it takes my skin to react why is it why i guess i need to be in that okay wow it did better than you this is the lane we should be in well this is the advantage that it has over me right it actually has data right so that's the tesla you would have gotten into an accident yeah you're welcome it's electric boogie woogie that's good i that okay we would to get over elaine but legally we should only start now put the blinker on now get over now perfect perfect good go go no i think it's okay in this lane really two lanes is for salary oh all right okay so it doesn't need that's what it thinks yeah that's what it thinks i mean i don't know if it'll be a problem but yeah it'll be tight because it'll be the north south there but yeah which i mean i've seen okay caviar handled pretty well all right i'm dying to see if it can handle this intersection yeah me too i'm dying to see what happens to jesse when he has to take over okay okay we're getting cut off big truck on the right yeah big truck on the right hard for the cameras to see yeah kind of a human okay we have our blinker on very hard to see that we're actually going this way we're getting cut off here but that's okay we're good i gave it a little bit of whoa okay yeah that is no thank you intervention number seven oh that one was the worst one by far how you doing there oh it wasn't doing a very good job your heart popped out of here and then it was just i'm going this way and i was slow down there buddy boy so that wasn't fun the steering wheel jerked which caused me to instantly jerk it back my eyes had to flip back and forth between the truck and my left side to make sure that i didn't hit anything and just look at the data here bit of whoa okay yeah yeah that's no thank you a huge gsr spike and i was right that one was the worst one by far it was in fact the worst one and zach was right your heart popped out of here and then it's just it looks my heart might have stopped talk about skipping a beat no no no no no no no no no no no no i'm just late if it tries to i'm gonna freaking don't do that can i cancel it i canceled it okay that's what i would have done anyway i would have said don't do that stay in this lane this is the lane that you wanted you might think that this isn't the lane that it wants yeah it thought it was going to go a different way so i just told it to do something that it didn't work oh i see yeah but it's it is the proper route so we'll we'll see how it goes we're technically an autopilot right now we're not even in full self driving this is good yep back up full subject hey relax relax slower number eight yeah that was bad yeah i know i know i know i'm taking control don't worry thanks for beeping at me loudly i'm sure that won't increase my stress at all it did look at my heart rate increasing well after the event happened and my gsr staying elevated as well thanks beeping go what the it's looking it's a tourist it's looking around oh my little view for the audience there sightseeing rumble you'll know where to look because you'll see the eye tracker oh that's a red light red light whoa whoa start breaking there and then we rolled back what the hell technically an intervention that was weird it might be because it sees that other green light ahead of us and it was which which i mean again tourist boston for you all right i'm i'm giving it a firm grasp on the wheel here because i mean it handled that beautifully i mean it wasn't fully in my lane cut off and cut off wow that handled it way smoother than i would have although then it put on the blanket parked amazon truck on the right how's it going to deal with that well wow look how close we are to this car yeah that update was good though it handled that really well all the kids give me a thumbs up well they see the camera on the roof or are they hitchhiking yeah i don't know or they're pretending to hitchhike that's what you do on a field trip i feel i can tell that i'm stressed out because the tape is giving way on the sensor oh yeah oh that's south station yeah i don't think i've ever where you been i haven't seen it from this angle before i've always been driving see so you get to look around and now and enjoy when we were driving past here before you were oh look the cherry blossoms and i was i didn't see any cherry blossoms yeah and that'll be picked up in the eye tracking this is so cool now you're relaxed which is a low but you you have these really stressed moments whereas on the first route i feel you were just alert the whole time no no no no no no no intervention numbers i mean no it's getting tired of the traffic or something you thought that the truck was stopped but i did not want to pull in front that's new to this version yeah well you can see why you'd think that it stopped it hasn't moved at all but it's just this is a red light welcome to boston right buddy so we want to get through and take a right so i'm gonna make a little gas there so i don't know if you count that as an intervention it was a little a little wobbly there we should be following that civic still green good good things we're done definitely not the right lane see what it yeah holy oh that would have been an intervention if i didn't think we're about to end oh no we're not going to let these people go actually sorry sorry bipolar car yeah whoo i think i think we've made it i'm gonna call it end right there okay so i i did win this i counted the 10 inches wow better than the 25 it did much better than i was expecting it to do all right jesse so we're done with the trip taking a deep breath here what are your thoughts anything uh obvious so let's just talk about full self driving it definitely couldn't handle some of the really difficult situations getting onto sturo drive um why do you think it was camera placement do you think it was i don't know i mean i kind of dumped it in right before we got on there so maybe i could give it a pass or something that but it just felt it was going to collide with that other car because here's my question when you do a merge that normally a human turns their neck and cranes to look back what what camera is it using uh it would be the rear repeater and the rear camera so it should be able to see behind it should have been able to see it because i could see it in the rearview mirror so then why was it being so i don't look i don't know if it was going to stop or not that's the problem with full self driving is you can't prove a negative right so me taking over was in an abundance of caution um what i think the car should have done was to do what i did and stop it but it might have been half a femtosecond before it was about to do that so it's it's hard to do a test of full soft driving because you can't prove what would have happened if you didn't take over there were a couple other times where just lane placement it didn't know where it was going in the lane and so it um it was trying to uh figure that out and and it got really jerky i wanna talk about your eyes for a second do you think you were looking more or less on the fsd trip versus when you were driving i think i was looking more when i was driving but that's because i have to be the one who's accurately making turns whereas when it's driving i'm just kind of making sure that everything's okay to me it felt i was able to anticipate things more whereas when i'm driving i'm more focused on where i'm going yep and that's basically what we found as you can see from this footage when full self driving beta was working well i was able to look around more not just where i was going however when it failed i was forced to regain situational awareness of where my car was and ascertain what input it needed to stay on course which leads to stress and i think the big question that everyone is asking which trip was more stressful when tesla drove the route or when i did and we have that data from imotions on the left is the control of me driving on the right is full self-driving beta driving the same route as you can see there's a pretty big difference galvanic skin response or the measurement of my palm sweat showed 28 more peaks and my average heartbeat was 8 percent higher while using full self-driving beta so yes full self-driving beta was more stressful than driving myself around boston but i think it's important to note that this was a tricky route in a famously difficult to navigate city with lots of traffic keep in mind that full self-driving beta might be less stressful on less congested and less complicated routes zach and i both felt that full self-driving beta was more stressful from the testing that we had done but now we have the science to back us up special thanks to nam and the team at imotions for hooking us up literally while we were there we got so much insight into what can be accomplished using their expertise we'll be interviewing their ceo peter hartzbeck over on our disruptive investing and you can see our unabridged testing footage over on patreon there you'll get to see all the behind the scenes and more for everyone who supports us for a buck a month if you enjoyed this give us a it would really help us out thank you so much for watching now you know,3
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJl35aIy5pOVBHvoGgqavrdJ,o-od9VNytZY,"hey i'm zack and i'm jesse and you're watching in depth on now you know [music] brought to you as always by our wonderful patreon patrons who help support this show which is the whole reason you're watching it and brought to you by a better route planner com they've had over 13 million trips planned and there's a new app for android and apple making it even easier to use a better route planner so plan your next cv trip with a better route planner comm and we're supported by eco we're us start positive conversations with carbon negative products we carbon offset the production shipping and lifecycle of every product and we plant a tree for every order so it is extremely carbon negative which means that whatever message you want to display on your shirt is going to be a carbon negative message on a carbon negative shirt so this week we have something to talk about that isn't particularly how should we say in your face hmmm yeah this is a tale about human nature and that very annoying human trait that can be summed up in the phrase you've heard many times before out of sight so what are we talking about here we're talking about underground storage tanks or us tees yeah these are tanks that store things gasoline and diesel you know you've seen them at the gas station no you haven't because they're underground and we're talking about those home heating fuel tanks right here in the northeast it's very common you have a tank sometimes it's in your basement but very often it's buried somewhere on your property and a big fuel truck comes every couple months and tops off your tank i remember there being uh big tanks in the basement i was afraid i thought there were monsters yeah well when you were little we had we had fuel tanks in the basement - 275 gallon tanks and the basement always stunk of diesel fuel and so we decided to switch and get off of oil and we switched to natural gas which is what we have now and hopefully someday soon we won't even have that but many people got these tanks during the 70s oil crisis when the price of gasoline and oil shot up and so during the summer you could buy heating oil cheaper than in the winter so you'd get big tanks usually to make the space you'd bury them somewhere in your property fill them up some people got thousand gallon tanks and that way you could buy it when it was cheap and then burn it all winter long so what were these tanks made out of you know they had to be buried they're made of steel but steel rusts so they use a special kind of steel new they used steel just regular old regular old rusty steel yes and they buried them it buried them in the grinder ground right in the ground right with where there's everything and that's normally in the ground water right moisture moisture water yeah there is no easy way to know if a tank is leaking so you're saying that they do rest that despite we knowing that we're gonna put them in the ground and that they're made out of steel and we didn't do we coat them in something it's just you're just you're telling me it's just steel yes okay and we buried them yes okay i'm just i just wanted to make sure because that sounded it sounded stupid a little stupid okay yeah yeah so you're probably wondering how big is this problem right well there's an estimated 1.2 million underground storage tanks in the united states many of which were installed before new regulations went into effect in 1988 so corrosion and other factors such as improper installation spills during product delivery and piping failures have already caused more than 550,000 confirmed underground storage tank leaks nationwide so you're saying of the 1.2 million steel tanks that we buried underground about half of them are confirmed to known to have leaked correct okay wow that was a dumb mistake i'm glad that that's over well that's not over actually there's 9,000 new leaks discovered every year so the epa the environmental protection agency estimates that cleanup of petroleum spilled underground could cost more than 32 billion dollars and here's what they're leaking benzene toluene mtbe cadmium xylenes naphthalene one two dial or fane ethyl benzene ethyl dibromide pcbs and just to name a few okay so but these things they're inspected right they're we put them in the ground and then people come and they look at them and they say hey i think this has been leaking right um you would think that but of the five hundred and forty six thousand us t's that store petroleum and hazardous substances in 2019 only eighty seven thousand three hundred and seventy-one were inspected so that's just sixteen percent of them were inspected because they they kind of just do 16 percent every year and so maybe over time you you you uh you get them all well we're gonna see a little later that you don't get them all well okay but no okay but it's that's it's okay it's okay it's fine that these leak right because it's all it's underground and we as humans live above the ground so if we're walking around and you pick something up off the ground it's not gonna be all covered in oil or naff dates or whatever don't worry about it's under the ground right we don't interact with the under this isn't minecraft okay except that fifty-one percent of the us population relies on groundwater as a source of drinking water that's more than a hundred and sixty million people oh and get this one gallon of petroleum can contaminate 1 million gallons of water and one pinprick sized hole in an underground storage tank can leak four hundred gallons of fuel a year and you'll never pick up on that pin size prick until it's too late and most of the time it the hole is gonna be a little bit bigger than that it'll start small and then it'll get bigger yeah okay so that's bad because unlike what i said before it does affect it does affect us because half the population of the u.s. at least gets their water from groundwater right in groundwater is water on the ground the ground jessica just to clear that up just to make sure we understand so can we just talk about the water table for a minute or so i don't i never really understood this when i was a kid but there's a thing called a water table yep and underground mm-hmm there is water right there's aquifers and so when you drill a well you either drill a shallow well and you get it from close to the water table or you drill a deep well and you hit aquifer and you pull the water up and as you suck water out of the aquifer you then if there's a leaking gas tank somewhere nearby you're just sucking that that contamination right into the aquifer because as you draw water up the well more water needs to come in to displace it so no matter what was dropped in there whether it was you know a food dye that could somehow make its way through the ground or oil or some nasty chemical yep it's just coming towards your well and so if you draw a lot of water and and let's say you're very far away but you're drawing a lot of water and there are many other wells between the leak and you you could be drawing that yeah you just draw it exactly and the problem is most people don't test their well water very often it's kind of a set it and forget it kind of thing right most people don't even know they're on well water to be honest a lot of people in my town for instance don't even know where the water comes from they just think oh comes from the city and some of it does and some of it doesn't right so they may not even know to check their well because they may not know that they have one okay but i mean once you figure out that the tank is leaking you just you just assume there's less just hooks and you just kind of get a small crane and you just pull it out of the ground and you're all set i love these wonderful assumptions i know the average cost to remove a tank from the ground if it hasn't leaked is about $10,000 yikes okay that's it i've said this hasn't leaked everything's still fine so you have to dig it up got to dig it up we got a backhoe if hopefully it's not under your driveway and hopefully you've basically drained it but you still have to clean out the residue exactly and then you can remove it yeah you have to hire specialists to do this isn't you know bob down the street and that's why it cost ten thousand right okay but now if it's a tank that's had a leak then you're in a whole different ballgame here because you got to involve the authorities and specialists and so forth and the average price of a leaking tank to get it out of the ground is four hundred thousand dollars up to four hundred thousand nope that's the average average that's the average and it could be a whole lot more than that depending on the size of the tank in the leak and who pays for that it depends most insurance companies won't pay for it most times it falls on the homeowner if it happens to be at a homeowners house if it happens to be at a gas station that is probably going to be the gas station responsible now there are some federal funds to help with cleanup but generally to start that whole process you're talking about whoever owns the land and you might not have even necessarily been the person who put it in who put it in you might have bought a house not really known much about what was going on with tanks and thought about it whatever and then you find oh you got a leaking fuel tank on your property and just to be clear it's a steel tank steel tank full of oil so somewhere on your property so way back in 1984 the us government knew that underground storage tanks were leaking across the country so congress set up lust that's the leaking underground storage tank trust fund okay that sounds a weird mall store okay it sounds some staffer in the congress who really had some fun that day okay if the leaking underground storage tank trust fund yes so you don't be more lust yeah but it's we got to keep an acronym that we understand got you lust gosh so did you know that every time you buy a gallon of gas in the united states you're paying one tenth of a penny into a fund to clean up the inevitable spills and leaks oh okay well i mean that's a pretty good solution to the problem well i mean it's kind of sad they knew it was gonna happen so they did it and so iepa spent billions of dollars over the next 30 years from 1984 on and they cleaned up four hundred and eighty eight thousand leaking tanks so that's great that they clean them up for awesome but the government only spends a fraction of what they collect to clean up the contaminated sites it collects 300 million dollars a year but it only spends about a hundred million dollars a year on cleanup even though we still have a hundred thousand leaking tanks left to go okay well that's good that must mean that there's just a big pot of money sitting in some federal account somewhere just ready we just need to hire a bunch of people use this money that we've been saving up for all this time yep and just take care of the problem except they've slowed way down because these remaining ones these remaining sites are some of the more expensive and more difficult sites to clean up so they kind of went after the easy ones first and now we got a lot of tough ones left and the sad news is that there's nine thousand new leaking ones that we find every year so the it's not we're getting smaller and smaller we're actually getting bigger and bigger and the problem is you just mentioned a pot of money right so congress loves lots of money and so what do they do well congress keeps stealing money from lust to pay for other things so for instance we wait can't congress you mean they put on some masks ky slink down to the wherever they keep the money and they and they steal it out and well they do and they just eat it what do they didn't know so in 2012 for instance they transferred 2.4 billion dollars from the lust fund to pay for other things and transportation roads even though that's not what it was meant to is meant to be for just for cleaning up spills and tanks and there's other parts of the gas tax that are supposed to be covered yeah i mean what most of the rest of the gas tax is supposed to pay for that but they yeah exactly so these basically that's what i'm saying they stole it because it wasn't meant for anything else other than underground storage tank cleaner why don't they just paint on why don't they just raise the gas tax a tenth of a cent how dare you raise the gas tax just we have not raised the gas tax in this country for decades i'm just saying if they need to say that you've been alive we have not touched the ground the gas tax even though inflation is happening yes ok but 2.4 billion dollars transferred from the lust fund which is supposed to go towards something that they haven't fixed yet it'd be one thing right if we were well we think we state but here but here do you see potholes every day when you're driving uh-huh do you see underground storage tanks every day while you're driving no no that's what i'm talking about out of sight out of mind so americans complain all the time about all roads are falling apart which they are so garcons okay that you're complaining about that that no congressman oh well yeah we're gonna pay for that job where can we get some money hey let's take it from someplace that no one's ever gonna notice so the gao the government accounting office reported in 2007 for instance that it will cost twelve billion dollars to clean up the remaining leaking tanks the remaining leaking tanks right and anytime there's more and more every year ok great so there's a backlog of a hundred and thirty thousand cleanups at active federally regulated ust so these are places where the government knows about 130,000 sites that the government knows about but get this there are 76 thousand closed ust so tanks that are no longer being used that have not been inspected they're just sitting there we don't know what's happened there they they could have leaked and there could be a whole lot of contamination needs to be cleaned up but we don't know and additionally there's 190,000 unregistered us t's so these are tanks that went in the ground that no one ever told anyone about and so the government doesn't even know they exist and so they have not been inspected because we don't know where they are okay okay all right that's superdumb all of this was dumb yes basically from from the moment they they put the shovel in the ground to stick a steel tank in the ground to fill it not with just water they put oil in there yep so every gas station you see put in since 1988 has double wall tanks and they're usually fiberglass and they're usually interstitial so that they have alarms so that if the first tank leaks an alarm goes off fiberglass tanks so that's a lot smarter every glass it doesn't rust right why didn't we do that to begin with well because it's expensive to put in a double wall tank with alarms so you know what else is expensive cleaning up these freakin leaks oh but you know you're gonna be dead i mean 1988 you know you're middle-aged person you put in a tank right now you leak until you're dead close to that probably so what do you care what a perfect solution leave the earth behind to the next generation yeah so this whole ust topic is just another example the hidden costs of fossil fuels when you pump gas in your internal combustion engine ice car and you pay let's say two dollars and sixty seven cents a gallon you are not paying the full cost of that gasoline you are not paying for the leaking tanks that are contaminating groundwater you are not paying for the adverse health effects of drinking that water and you're not paying for the adverse health effects of the air pollution from your tailpipe emissions or the greenhouse gas emissions and those costs to warming our planet so when people say that we can't afford building all these turbines and batteries and and solar panels it's just too expensive well you just asked them can we afford all of these thousands of leaking underground storage tanks billions of dollars of ticking time bombs that will be poisoning our water for decades to come who's gonna pay for that solar panels and wind turbines don't poison our water or pollute our air so going forward are we still going are we gonna keep putting underground storage tanks in the ground is that really that weird that was a good solution can we not learn from this and go oh maybe that was dumb maybe we should be thinking about all sorts of different things when we're installing things that have stuff in them maybe maybe we should know where those things are just in case something bad happens to them yeah and this is just another one of those subsidies that we don't talk about the federal government is taking your tax dollars every time you buy gas and putting it into a fund to pay for leaking tanks and then they don't spend it on that they spend it on the roads right because they haven't raised the gas tax since i've been born and yet they blame eevee's and it's oh there should be evey taxes to pay for the road right and it's okay maybe we should all be paying a higher tax rate on to pay for the roads so if the roads aren't fixed right i mean let's just be honest but i mean eevee's don't have any of these costs involved with them they don't pollute the air they don't pollute the water right you don't go to a gas station and again this is where renewable energy we're gonna put it in and then we're gonna be why is there more money in all of our pockets because we're not you don't wake up one morning and you can you go outside and something for some you've you know decided to dig something and you're oh no there's a storage tank here and it's polluted all of my land i mean there are news stories where homeowners basically lose their house if the house the whole area or surrounding their house and their house has to pick up the house they have to move it they have to dig scrape all that stuff away ship it somewhere who cares and then put down new new land and then the the homeowners broke yep super broke because their insurance won't cover it the world's broken and fossil fuels are a huge part of that problem and it's just so frustrating that's why we are talking about this this is one little teeny tiny problem that occurs when you have fossil fuels yeah because where are you gonna keep them it's underground right there's one there's one gas station in a sitting nearby where they have the tanks above-ground and anytime i am driving along and someone sees that they go oh my god that's really scary it's yeah at least we could see when it's leaking and at least they're apparently made out of aluminum since they aren't rusting i hope they look they're put in the 80s it's just again out of sight out of mind and there's so much of this out of sight out of mind stuff when it comes to pm 2.5 particulates when it comes to co2 emissions when it comes to asthma i mean most of the time you're not seeing that stuff nope so anyway just a little still a little thing to bring to you this week share this with your friends because i don't know this makes me want to it's good thing you knew where your tanks were because i'm gonna break out a you know just to make sure there's none on your property i know right yikes scary stuff alright well thank you so much for watching now you know",0
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJl35aIy5pOVBHvoGgqavrdJ,7s8R-2Qg0SM,hey i'm zack and i'm jesse welcome to our series on elon the disruptor we're always so busy on this reporting on ilan's incredible enterprises these past few years that we realized we sometimes lose sight of the big picture so we're going to show you how elan could very well be the biggest disruptor in human history [music] i think there are many reasons why we can't see all the disruptions that elon is heading up today the first is that we are in the middle of them most of us have never reflected on what it feels to be in the middle of a disruption even though many of us have actually lived through a few if you're thirty years or older then you may remember that to call a friend used to involve this until about 1985 whenever you made a phone call you were attached to a physical wire and you could never stray far from it no matter how hard you try this hard wired telephone technology was patented in 1876 so it was the dominant technology for over a hundred years people had been born with a wired phone in their house people had grown up with wired phones and people had died knowing nothing but wired phones then along came the wireless phone in the early 1990s and it was a game-changer remember you could walk around the house around the office in fact you can even walk aways out of your house and still be on the phone and then in the late 1990s we started seeing people walk around with these things yes they were big yes they were expensive but they were a mobile phone and that made them sought-after i mean you could literally walk anywhere and communicate with anyone sure not everyone had them in the 1990s but by the year 2000 most of us did they weren't smart yet but these cell phones were a disruption they disrupted the old landline phone here's a chart of cell phone sales take a look at how it took off within a few short years cell phones displaced their traditional landline telephone market the old technology was replaced now are their landlines still around today yes are there still some rotary dial telephones yes a disruption doesn't mean that the old technology is necessarily completely gone entirely but it does mean that the majority of people have moved on to the new technology leaving the old technology pretty much to collector shelves and yard sale bargains you see if you're at least 30 years old then you know what this cell phone disruption feels now that we are completely unattached the wall now that most of us have cell phones we can start to see new possibilities that just didn't occur to most of us when we were attached to our walls only a very small number of people have the imagination to see what the world could look and even a smaller number of people can see that future possibility and make it into a reality the second problem most of us have seeing all the disruptions that ilan is making happen is that most people don't see anything much happening you might notice a supercharger location got installed nearby you might remember seeing a red roadster launched into space you might have seen something about a boring tunnel party but these don't affect your everyday life because let's face it there are still gas stations they're still traffic so what are all these disruptions we're talking about so going back to the cell phone analogy when you first started noticing business people walking around with their blocky expensive cell phones how did that affect your daily life it didn't your life didn't change you didn't have one of those new mobile phones you still had to find a phone booth to make your calls when you were away from the office but your life was about to change a few years later you would get a cell phone your life was about to be disrupted you just didn't know it yet and the third problem was seeing all the disruptions that elan is causing as well it just doesn't seem possible it just seems strange we humans are practical creatures we base our thinking and our decisions on our own experiences i mean that's how we learn after all we experience something and then we commit it to memory and then later we draw on that memory to decide what to do about something new we face for instance what did you learn from the last time you needed to buy an automobile you probably went to your local car dealer the things that elon musk is talking about don't make sense with the reality we know i mean he's telling us to buy his cars online no more dealers and his cars don't use gas or diesel they have batteries that get powered by electricity you may have never experienced this before so that sounds strange staying away from strange things has largely protected us humans for thousands of years those berries look strange i'm not going to eat them staying away from strange things has historically been the safest option go with the tried and true and you can't go wrong right i guess but how did that work out for countless companies that stayed away from the strange in this series we're going to deep dive into the industries that ilan is currently disrupting and show how big that disruption will be we'll show you how big and how important these disruptions are and how they will affect everyone on the planet i hope you'll join us thanks for watching now you know thanks so much

Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJl35aIy5pOVBHvoGgqavrdJ,KTjaUYRDgeg,hey everybody i'm zach and i'm jesse you're watching tesla time news episode 329 on now you know [music] we're brought to you as always by our amazing patreon patrons help support us bring you independent news every week by heading over to patreon.com there's really cool perks and it makes a great late christmas present where you go oh i did not get enough of that guy all you have to do sign up for patreon and give them a login yep so i thought we'd bring you kind of a holiday special here we've put out so many cool videos over the past year or so uh on our in-depth that a lot of you don't see and i get it you're into this show not that show but uh you're missing a lot of stuff and we wanted to just kind of give you some highlights of the stuff you might have missed yeah and i mean youtube is notoriously bad at hiding content from people that they don't think that maybe you don't it but sometimes you're just wow how did i miss that and here is the first one i don't think a lot of people actually missed this one this one was uh on the rivian this was kind of our first go-around with rivian figuring out that um well you know they were selling something that uh a little bit more than you could buy the exact same thing yeah we figured out how to get this tent for the rivian a lot cheaper and in fact a lot faster i don't even know if you still can get the official one i think that we're one of the only rivians in the world that has the yakima tent yeah so you get to see in this the whole you know testing it out what it's um and i was really proud of it because it took us days to shoot and we had to figure a whole lot of stuff out to get it done um and yeah a lot of you did watch it the sad part is that we kind of had to do a clickbaity title to get people to watch it and that's not really our thing we don't want to have to do that but um yeah let's go to the next the next one we tested out the tent and uh that was actually made much much more difficult because of the electrify american network um we wanted to do you know camping and camping typically means that you don't you know go down the street so we we wanted to go kind of a ways away to do you know a what we felt was a commensurate camping episode yeah we went to put the rivian through its adventure paces look i mean lots of things went really right the rivian had really great you know power on board so we were able to cook using electrical power we didn't have to light any fires which is great from a carbon standpoint um the rooftop tent that we bought um oh yeah i forgot all about the cooking i mean we we were the first to even try to get some kind of camp kitchen going um and we still can't get the camp kitchen no and we and we showed you a way that you can do it very cheaply yeah and a way that would work even you know you bring it back to your kitchen because you know why spend six thousand dollars on the rivian camp kitchen that you can't use in your kitchen so basically with just a couple of appliances we were able to kind of do that um so yeah i mean overall pretty good but very stressful when it came to the charging and then we thought it's a pickup truck everyone's gonna you know try and tow something with it so we would show you all about towing and we came up with a lot of hacks you were really good at towing well yeah i mean when you're towing a trailer uh the trailer is going to be slightly inefficient if you go fast it's going to be inefficient so yeah we found a way that you can really extend the range of driving the rivian with a trailer because sometimes you you're just going to not have any charging so yeah just little things that little tweaks to the way that i drive i think are going to make a big difference in our total range so yeah coming home from that camping trip is very insightful to see that we could make it the whole way without having to stop and charge and a lot of these hacks don't just apply to the rivian they apply to any electric vehicle when you're towing so if you're watching this now and you're well i don't have a rivian yeah but you still might tow something with your ev so check this out and then of course i'm a contractor so i wanted to test out whether you could actually use the outlets on the rivian to power tools and so we did a power tool test so we have a power we got power we got air let's do it let's make some work with the truck all right let's do it next so now you know battery chargers work pretty much every power tool that we tried it worked you'd have to use one power tool at a time which i mean for one person it's not that big a deal but you're not gonna have a whole construction crew running off your truck i mean the only thing that bums me out is that i really thought you could trickle charge a car if you you know plugged in uh the rivian charged it at your cabin and then you want to charge from it for some reason i don't know why but yeah i don't know yeah or if you went and visited somebody on the side of the road to give them a few miles but you can't it doesn't seem you can do it yeah but it doesn't seem you can do it we tried three different chargers and three different vehicles and it just didn't work yeah you certainly can't charge itself and that one worked pretty good but now let's get away from reviewing for a minute and let's look at uh the ford f-150 lightning we could do so much more tool stuff with the lightning um because it has 220 on board because it has a 20 amp circuits as opposed to just barely a 15 and multiple 20 amp circuits multiple 20 amp circuits it's very impressive the difference between the rivian and the ford in terms of what it can do as a as a power source and so look maybe you're not a contractor but maybe someone in your family or your friends are this might be a good to share with them because they you know for their next truck they might be able to go electric start breaking rocks okay foreign [music] sort of system the the onboard power in a much different sort of way we made a mobile office and you know maybe we shouldn't have put michael scott on the thumbnail i don't know and started telling the thumb that that starlink in the back but basically we tested i think we're one of the first to make a mobile office not only that but do gaming live gaming in the office that's on a truck it's pretty amazing we had a gaming pc full gaming tower we had internet through starlink while we were moving we were going 60 70 miles an hour on the highway under overpasses and all sorts of things and we were able to show um very low latency uh using starlink it was very amazing we were able to watch videos i think that that was uh pretty cool we found out that the hardest part about gaming it while you're in a moving vehicle is actually it's not the internet that's the problem it's the moving around if you're trying to aim and it's not working and then if you're gonna test an office you gotta test whether or not you can put a rock band in the truck uh so that's the kind of stuff we do uh yeah we put a full pa system in the back of the truck to see if it would work and you be the judge and then we wanted to test these two trucks uh where really matters in my opinion and that is uh charging speed so we spent the whole day we had to drive we had to drive all the way to the nearest 350 kilowatt electrify america charger and test the charging speeds of both the rivian and the ford f-150 lightning and it was really really interesting results yeah and i think again we're probably one of the first to have these real world results and uh present them to you i think it's important information when you're deciding to buy these trucks how long it's going to take to charge in in the real world because you know there is peak charge rate and that's great but the most important part is what is the charging rate during the entire thing because well if you've done calculus you'll know that you need to have sort of the integral of what it is that's going to determine how fast fast you're charging this yeah the area under the curve area under the curve so um you know the rivian started off really strong and then it just dropped really really low and the ford kind of caught up it was tortoise in the hair a little bit yeah not to mention a really cool western intro you got to check it out jessica you know we do our best on this to you know put in some cinematography from time to time this is one of the examples you're not going to want to miss that now this next in depth is something i'm actually super proud of but nobody watched yeah and it's a weird one we took an electric scooter and uh we were so bummed that it was the winter and we couldn't really ride it around that we turned it into a snow scooter and i think we're the first in the world to have converted one uh electrically there's a couple gas powered ones on the internet but i think this is the first and we showed you how to do it and we showed you the results and i don't know why didn't everyone just watch it this is amazing this is stuff you can do in your shop i gotta say that i was i was pretty proud of ourselves for what we were able to accomplish um on a very low budget by the way very low budget very minimal welding skills that was was my first time welding aluminum yeah using tig welding so it was uh it was quite a learning experience i think that if you ever want to be thinking about any kind of projects this is a great little to just kind of entertain yourself and and you know sort of titillate the idea centers of your brain as to what you can accomplish plus i want to say we came up with a really good uh belt tensioning system there for on our first try i know pretty darn good and if you're look zach and jesse this is the that was the most uh stupidest form of transportation you've ever brought to us well then let's talk about this that is the neo e moped a really cool form of transportation really really great form of transportation one that i really think that more people need to at least consider and think about but apparently no one want to watch that episode either and i think this is one of the problems on our is uh you know you guys probably want to talk a lot about tesla but we love all e-mobility and we're trying to give all the different nooks and crannies of it and this one i really love because i think for a lot of people this could be better than a car this one basically minting money a quote from elon our interview with energy acts a lot of people saw and it's a really exciting company that jesse and i are invested in we wanted to tell you about um and so yeah really fun to talk to ceos of companies and that's one of the really fun things of our job i think is that we get to talk to founders and smart people and bring you what they're doing in the world that's innovative and disruptive so i urge you if you haven't checked this one out you really should speaking of innovative companies aptera is that three-wheeled solar-powered electric vehicle that we're super excited about in san diego and again we got to interview one of the co-ceos and the new head of solar and we learned so much more about what they're planning to put out and if you're interested in that vehicle you should go check this one out we often say do your own research or check it out for yourself when it comes to making informed decisions reputable sources are so important this is why we're excited to tell you about ground news ground news is a non-partisan news aggregator app and website that lets you see how breaking news is covered across the political spectrum they gather news from 50 thousand sources from around the world so you can stay fully informed on issues being covered by the media compare coverage and know where your news is coming from for every story you get a quick visual breakdown of which news outlets are covering it their political bias how factual their reporting practices are and what type of entity owns them checking in on topics is simple we searched news about tesla when we on the first article you can see how many total news sources covered this specific story how many are leading left leaning right or are considered center and you can compare the headlines on the same story to see how language can shape our understanding and it's not just the headlines at ground news you can read the entire article to see how topics unfold around the world and across the political spectrum they're one of the sponsors we're very proud of get informed go to ground.news nyk or visit the link in the description to stay fully informed on issues this compare headlines and know where your news is coming from now here's one that i know you didn't watch and i'll be honest this one's kind of a a little more out there for in terms of content that we do you know we do the tesla stuff we do the sustainability stuff and a lot of that has to do with energy and energy storage and i get that a lot of you are interested in that kind of stuff this is more on the recycling side of things this is more on waste stream management stuff which i know tends to be a little bit less exciting but this interview is really really well done yeah i mean i got to meet tim devos when i was in the netherlands on our european road trip and it's just so great all the amazing people that we get to meet and he's just doing this amazing work that i wanted to share with you guys of course it didn't get a lot of views but i think it is a great kind of going along with this you know waste theme we we interviewed this company called poly loop they have a system uh where they've made a microbe that can eat plastic i know incredible stuff so instead of having to take plastic and either burn it or bury it in the ground for 10 000 years what they're able to do is take plastic feed it to to microbes in special conditions and it doesn't leak out into the world and now we have plasticated microbes we don't it doesn't work that they don't live in regular conditions so now instead of having you know plastic waste or soot we're going to have bio available stuff so all the constituents of the plastic get turned into stuff that the earth is used to dealing with yeah exactly it's kind of decomposed yeah it seems impossible but again that's why we interviewed the founders of these companies to explain it to you directly and another cool recycling company loop we talked to tom zaki he's a really cool guy and i mean just so many amazing ideas have come out of his brain and so we wanted to bring you a direct conversation with him and i think that you'd get a lot out of watching this and you know this is the last one that we're going to talk about in terms of waste but you know it it really was interesting and valuable to me because it changed the way that i thought about waste you kind of think about waste as being it's all used up and you talk to tom zach and he's this is a gold mine people are throwing valuable thing things into a into a bin i want that stuff that stuff i want to own that yeah um and you're wait but i thought that it was garbage and he's no right it's not garbage that's it's gold all the way down to diapers i know they can recycle diapers recycled diapers and it's it makes sense to do that yeah that's i mean if you need to have your mind shifted a little bit that is a great to watch next up a lot of you watch this one so i'm glad but if you haven't i think it's worth a re-watch this that came out before we posted the debunking of it was so fuddy was so full of misinformation and egregious lies yeah i mean that's why we called her a liar because there's no way you could have done any research for this and not seeing that what you're putting out was lying let's debunk this piece of all the way down to the footage that she used where she's how are we gonna recycle batteries well she was using footage from battery recyclers oh my gosh i'm so glad that we did that and that's because of you guys you guys reached out to us and said hey zach and jesse take a look at this we want you to debunk it and we did another debunking not as many people saw this one not as many people saw this one again this came from a viewer a viewer sent in this email really weird email that they got again just full of misinformation and lies um and we were happy to debunk that one i think it's really important to kind of see what the other side is gonna come at you with just so you can be okay and then and then you know right then you can look at it and be okay this is not true or there's there is some truth to that and this is another reason why we're doing this uh episode today so that if you see something here that you're you know i have someone in my life i could share that with uh it's important to go find it and share it of course we had to talk about tesla bot and how it's going to change the world we love talking about the future on this we really feel we have an insight into what's coming and tesla bot is coming and it is going to change everything and we just feel you know instead of burying our heads in the sand and pretending it's not coming let's know what it's all about and prepare exactly i am so proud of this a breath of fresh air because we actually did a lot of work and research into showing that landscaping can be done electrically instead of gas powered and we gave lots of facts and figures showed that laws are changing and if you're a landscaper you really need to watch this so every weekend about 54 million americans mow their lawns using 800 million gallons of gas per year now that's less than one percent of all the gas burned in cars in the u.s but because these engines are so dirty according to the epa gas mowers just gas mowers represent 5 percent of u.s air pollution we were actually reached out to by landscapers who said i watched this it was really amazing i'm making the switch now because you've presented really good arguments which brings us to our next which is really funny because it actually predated our other and this is about a company up in canada who i think it was three years before we came out with the previous in-depth was already doing electric landscaping it's part of the reason we knew that we could promote it it's because we knew that it was being done yeah um and this is before we had all the choices that we have today he was making it work on a very limited number of models he had a solar powered trailer that was charging all of his devices cutting edge and this is what i mean we get to see what's coming before the rest of the world does and share that with you and get your brain spinning yeah it was a really cool interview i'm so excited that we were able to kind of bring that so early on it got my mind changed really early and that's what helped us write that other in-depth this and depth i think is the one that i am absolutely the most proud of out of any in depth we've ever done the magic school bus the magic school bus it was the worst thumbnail we've ever chosen i love it it doesn't make any sense it doesn't clue anyone in as to what the heck we're talking about but electric school buses are this thing that i think a lot of people are yes we should electrify all fleets eventually and you know electric school buses will be one of those fleets eventually yes carbon emissions is an important thing to consider when we're talking about electrification but your children's brains and pollution how does pollution affect people well it goes out not linearly it's the closer you are to the source of pollution the more polluted you are being and who sits on a diesel truck for hours a week right it's one of the few times in anyone's life that they're going to be sitting on a diesel truck for hours and hours and hours of their life and so we gave you lots of cool facts and figures we actually had one of our viewers changed his mind about things and he went out and actually got electric school buses and gave them away yes a million dollars in buses because you saw this i'm so happy that we started getting this conversation going and now every district in america that you look at is starting to talk about electric school buses we were years ahead of the curve and i'm just so proud of that and i think that it is really important that i know that a lot of people are going to be in agreeance about carbon emissions when we're talking about our boss fleets but it is very critically crucially important to the health of children that their brains are not being polluted by pm 2.5 particles by nitrogen dioxide emissions that are coming out of the back of their school buses getting whipped around in the eddy currents and coming back in through the windows and just through the body of the bus they've done studies to prove that the inside of a school bus is not a really good place for developing brains so switching to electric school buses is going to have such a greater impact than just co2 emissions and i think that our in-depth does a really good job of showing that it's another one of our videos that i really think you should share with your school committee and your your principals out there yeah you know we just talked about the guy who put up a million dollars to buy electric school buses uh we did an interview with him this was a really interesting one it's about patent scams and you might be saying zach and jesse what does that have to do with tesla and it it is actually a little bit related to tesla it's kind of one of the reasons why tesla does what they do when it comes to patents if you want to understand patents in the country in this country this is a you have to watch because this is real world what's actually going on not just a textbook from 30 years ago talk about a guy who makes a difference he came out with a movie that he made and funded himself which exposed patent scams fantastic movie by the way the patent scam you really should see it and the law has changed since then yeah he probably made some impact here's an episode that i am very proud of we talked about oil assets being stranded becoming stranded and it's this thing that i don't think that anyone is talking about right now and that is to do with solar and wind they are the cheapest forms of electric generation and for the longest time do you know how many solar panels you'd have to make where would you put them all what happens at night or when it isn't sunny what happens when the wind doesn't blow it just won't work the grid can't handle intermittent loads now that we have battery systems that can back up our grids for overnight you know generation and stuff that we're going to be relying less and less and less on coal natural gas and oil fired power plants and other forms of of power generation and these assets along with the things that bring them the stuff that they need to burn are all going to become what is called stranded assets and you might be saying what's the big deal who cares well you might have wondered why the oil and gas industry has been pushing so hard to fight electric vehicles and to fight um green energy this is one of the reasons why this is one of the biggest reasons why they've already spent all this money on all of these different things that they had to buy from power plants to coal mines to oil fields to even just tanker ships and stuff that all of these assets are going to become stranded if they're not required anymore right and they haven't finished paying them off because they weren't really planning ahead for the future that much and so they're trying to slow down the transition this kind of goes into why that is which leads right into the impending big auto oil implosion explained and i am really proud of this because it really explains to you the oversight of why is this all happening why is it going to go wrong because a lot of you i think watch this and are you seem so sure that evs are going to make it in the big oil and big otto is going to die and we gave you lots of facts and and understanding of why that's going to happen in this and if you're wondering why we feel that way it's pretty much all explained in this from a little while ago go and a lot of that stuff has come true exactly so yeah we've just really been trying to stay on top of this we've really been ahead of the curve in terms of talking about some of this stuff where people are just you guys are crazy this is never going to happen right and now it's starting to be oh this might happen and i mean there's a lot going on geopolitically right now and we put out this on five things you can do to stop this man and uh there's things you can do in your own life that will actually have an impact on the world and i think we're all feeling that right now we all want to have something that we can do but it feels impossible um you can hear i i hope we empowered you right because um you have to keep in mind if you have been buying gasoline you are in part supporting country that produces yes gasoline whether or not you're buying the gasoline from that country and it's not all fear we put in there five things you can do and this is another one here's another a big one and uh we've had a big impact on just this alone and this has had very few views i really urge you to check this out this is about about defunding big oil in a way that you can do it because you might be saying oh i'm not funding big oil well if you have money in a bank there's a good chance that you actually are you see banks what do they do they loan out money that's how they make their money you're you're thinking of this place all wrong as if i had the money back on a safe the money's not here well your money's in joe's house whose money are they loaning out your money and so if you have a bank that's loaning money out to big oil to either buy or lease oil fields or build uh dirty power plants you're helping to support big oil indirectly and in this we tell you how you can move your money to banks that don't and so far we found out from just the few people that filled out our google spreadsheet that over 100 people have done this and they've moved over seven million dollars away from funding big oil i'm super proud of that so go watch this fill out the spreadsheet and tell us what you're doing yeah this episode i think is still just as important as it was when when it came out and it is about the supercharger stupid yeah it's tesla's moat and we're all kind of worried now right is it going to stay emote is he going to give it away and that's what we talk about in this episode we got a lot of flack for this one dear tesla jesse and i love you we've always loved you but tesla we love you but yeah it's probably our most controversial uh because you know these two fanboys here of tesla actually had to give some tough love to elon and uh we had some good reason to do it you should watch the and find out what we were so upset about that we felt we had to say it i love filming this i can't believe we got to do this so as you know full self-driving beta has been out for a while and a lot of people have been you know testing it out um and i've always been stressed testing it out and people have always gone jesse why are you so stressed i have the scientific data to back it up now we went to a company called imotions and they hooked me up with all sorts of sensors and gadgets tracking my eyes tracking the sweat of my palms to see when i you know was stressed out your heart rate tracking my heart rate as we were driving in full self-driving beta through boston massachusetts and we did it scientifically we did it both with full self-driving and not so we could compare and you're gonna see the data in this it's really cool stress is good stress is good this is such a hidden gem of an in-depth that we did quite a while ago and it is the hidden cost of fossil fuels just just one of them it's not all of them and uh might be not something that you're thinking of it's underground storage tanks for gasoline or oil yeah and you might be saying what about them yeah i never see them they leak and uh they also just pollute the air as well and you might be saying who cares well they're polluting air near schools near homes near your water splash and uh yeah they're also polluting the water supply so just another little hidden cost of fossil fuels that we wanted to add into our list here because i was very proud of that in depth i'm proud of this series we did elon the disrupter series and we showed you all the different things elon is doing to disrupt the world many people just know him for tesla maybe some people known for spacex but there's so many things and we walk through all of them and i'm really proud of it but of course not many people watched it of course not it you know it was uh some of them were pretty popular but there was one that we missed we didn't anticipate him disrupting twitter so that's the one that was missing so being the holiday season we wanted to get this episode out to you and also give our team a break uh we've been doing episodes you know one right after the other this is what episode 329 uh we have not missed a week and we still haven't missed a week we'll get back to regular news next week but we want you and your family to enjoy the holiday thank you so much for watching and you know if you've got a little time this holiday season maybe pop in our playlist here that we have down below and watch some of these in-depth that you may have missed we'll see you next time now you know,0
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJmc2lGj1pSF0Joi0WXr5bnX,pWdoOVSzQVE,hey everybody i'm zach and i'm jesse and you're watching elon's tweets of the week so many tweets this week that we had to move it over to a show again that's a separate show from tessa time news look there's a lot of controversial stuff a lot of topics on here that could trigger people we're not going to talk about every single one of them obviously there's just way too many this week but we are going to be just showing you what elon is thinking and i think the important thing here is this takes us hours to go through elon's thread this this past couple weeks that means that most of you most people in the world are not doing that so when they hear about some tweet that someone plucked out and put out of context it's easy to say whatever you want to say about it when we put things back in context into his thread at least you might get a sense of where his mind really is at and that is the kind of the goal of this show so that if you're if you're why are you covering that tweet or whatever it's to give context okay so buckle up here we go kanikoa substock said number one david sachs breaks down how the safety layer of chat gtp is a democrat there's mounting evidence open ai safety layer is very biased if you thought trust and safety were bad under vieja or yule wait until the ai does it and elon said it's very important thread major problem so we've talked about how there's a safety layer on top of the ai layer and that is written by humans and it seems to be very biased at the moment and i mean elon didn't say anything specifically as to whether i mean he's saying that the bias is worrying right exactly i mean i think that the bias is kind of the problem that lead in all of the ai stories it's the bias that they pre-put into the ai that that is what causes the world to end exactly david dad says a gtp instance is not a moral patient because it doesn't actually maintain any continuity of memory between sessions and then elon says the internet is its memory okay wyvern published this the great decarceration most people are unaware that incarceration rates have fallen a lot in recent years the black incarceration rate fell by 35 between 2006 and 2018. went on to say meanwhile a recent survey found that most people think that incarceration rates have increased not decreased dramatically the great decarceration should be more widely known it might help explain the increase in crime elon said i was one of those who incorrectly thought incarceration rates had increased such a big decrease is surprising to learn world of engineering says the first air conditioner was used not for personal comfort but to remedy high humidity that interfered with the printing process i wonder if that's how they ended up being called air conditioners instead of air coolers elon said an ideal air conditioner should optimize temperature and humidity while filtering out particulate and pathogens very important to eat here it's one of those that gets overlooked while they're looking for the more you know bombastic tweets this i think points to tesla someday getting into hvac massimo tweeted this the eye of sauron what you're looking at is a top-down view of a lava river rushing down a hill in iceland and yes this is the actual speed at which it was flowing actual liquid rock at 1250 degrees celsius and again i love that this is what elon's seeing this week so that's what's on his mind doge designer says community notes is one of the best features of twitter i've seen various propaganda myths misinformation rumors and even crypto scams getting busted elon the rabbit hole says real talk though why are so many marxists from cushy-rich backgrounds elon says marx was a trust fund kid massimo says tonight while you sleep you'll be kind of brainwashed blood will flow out of your head a watery liquid called cerebrospinal fluid will flow in washing through your brain in rhythmic pulsing waves elon says taking out the trash trunk fan says wild stat tweets from bts band members accounts for 17 of the 30 most liked tweets ever elon said the macaulay culkin tweet was fire and he was talking about how he turned 40. elon says worth reading and that's the new tim urban book called what's our problem and i've begun reading it myself it is very good elon said say what you want about me but i acquired the world's largest non-profit for 44 billion dollars laugh out loud derek smart says right now open source it then we'll be truly impressed he said prepare to be disappointed at first when our algorithm is made open source next week but it will improve rapidly alex says when reuters reports content days sometimes a week after i tweeted it or published it in the newsletter what is our mainstream media worth elon replied said i keep getting deja vu from the news thinking wait that happened again but actually it's just delayed reporting martin bard says how ancient roman bridges were built and this is just a cool i mean look you could have showed this to me in high school whatever and i would it would have saved 30 days of of teaching me because just one i'm oh now i get it and if you showed me this in high school i might have actually been paying attention in class elon said the main reason rome won was because they had the best engineering wall street silver says rolling stone does it again with this crazy headline why cancel culture is good for democracy elon said how blatantly obnoxious that they just want to keep canceling people do they ever write about music anymore they should rename themselves scolding stone as all they seem to do these days is holier than down nagging sam put out this meme trust no one iceland greenland said a crystal clear lesson that product is better than marketing in the long run tesla economics says is there something wrong putting millions of dollars behind this man i don't know why so many people are always telling me i'm foolish to do this because in my eyes i see the future and potential through him and his companies elon said this kid is definitely going to love trolling americans for public trust says new left-wing billionaire pierre omadire bankrolls the shadowy group pushing a corporate boycott of twitter elon said any truth to this omadar zubi says humans are addicted to doomsday narratives i've noticed that sometimes people want things to be worse than they are so their neuroticism and paranoia will be vindicated elon said bullseye i think it's because people want to do physical things and they're well if i didn't have to go to my job i could be doing actual things with my hands well i can't i can't possibly just quit my job and do that so i have to wait for the world to end that's how i can do it it is true it can be fun when the zombies and then i could have a spear that'll be great wall street silver says it feels every day we're inching closer to world war iii and neither side seems to even want to discuss negotiations elon says the stakes are high anyone against critical thinking cannot be regarded with any credibility at all i that that should be over the doors to most schools wall street silver says the bite administration is preparing to sign up the united states to a legally binding accord with the world health organization that would give this geneva-based un subsidiary the authority to dictate america's policies during a pandemic is this real can states do this elon says this is not good elbridge colby says navy secretary they have 13 shipyards in some cases their shipyard has more capacity one shipyard has more capacity than all of our shipyards combined that presents a real threat of great strategic significance he's talking about the chinese shipyards john arnold says how in the world does mckinsey have 45 000 employees and that is a worldwide consulting group and elon says my thoughts exactly wow talk about being replaced by ai's 45 000 people zach ware says zoom's killer feature is making you look 100 times better on camera than google meet google meet is the airplane bathroom mirror of meeting apps this is art this is how we zoom with it with people so i don't think it matters kelly says my biggest concern with tesla isn't adding someone new to the board is making sure we give back elon complete control of the company new voting stock chairman etc if we let a rule by committee happen it will be the start of tesla's downfall elon said in a rapidly changing technology landscape conventional wisdom fails and then he put out a chart here of u.s light vehicle sales 2022 versus 2021 that is the growth of tesla and pretty much the loss of every other company what about genesis oh you mean the band no christopher rufo says biden's new executive order creating a national dei bureaucracy has a special mandate for woke ai the order instructs the federal government to protect the public from algorithmic discrimination and to deploy ai systems in a manner that advances equity elon said that would be a major restructuring of the federal government which requires an act of congress an executive order is not sufficient and then he put out this meme this is illuminati but they never ask how is illuminati and then kristen put out this meme i didn't have enough money to build a stone fence so i got the freemasons to build it elon says doing all that masonry for free was not a sustainable business model that's a joke yeah it's the dad mode that he goes into sometimes omar's catalog says i can't wait to see people's stunned reactions as cyber truck climbs the sales charts elon says ramping production as always will be the challenge not demand and then a quote from elon he has said before that the foundation series by isaac asimov is a book recommendation then he went on say had a major influence on me and then he retweeted pictures of the falcon 9 and dragon rolling out of the hangar at launch complex 39a and then crew 6 being completed for a full rehearsal of launch day activities and it looks they scrubbed that mission unfortunately yeah so march 2nd looks the next lunch date um and then that quote that we talked about today as elon got on stage at the new um palo alto headquarters engineering headquarters he said we specialize in making the impossible merely late and he said yeah um zubi says when will everybody admit that the whole covenant 19 pandemic response was a scam john says it's coming farzad says might be too early in saying this but it really does seem elon is playing both sides of the political aisle really well as of late right-wing rhetoric with freedom of speech and twitter left wing with supercharger networks and evs and cali headquarters interesting tesla impossible there's only two sides in this political spectrum 50 of america doesn't exist elon says at least half but probably more 80 percent is centrist or at least apolitical but most of that remaining 20 is on this platform lol the rabbit hole says humans have identified themselves throughout history by villages countries religion race etc the final step in this journey will be for us to identify as human foremost and all else second this will be necessary when we inevitably make first contact with aliens and elon give a heart to that tweet peter diamantis from mit says i've stopped watching tv news they couldn't pay me enough money dylan said yeah david sack says during the cold war the u.s made an effort to keep russia and china divided despite both being murderous communist regimes now we're pushing them closer together as a result of biden's war on autocracy this is dangerous and foolish elon says a russia-china alliance is inevitable it will grow much stronger over time these are the kind of tweets again that don't get much press um and then he tweeted out this uh space elevator which you can press the space button or the earth button or somewhere in between and he's uh it's on launch day when the crew members arrive at the pad they'll ride the tower elevator to the access arm and board dragon for their flight to space and this is what they'll see google photos tweeted out starting to roll out today google one members on android and ios will be able to enjoy magic eraser a new hdr effect free shipping on select prints sort orders and more so you can easily perfect all of your memories in google photos and that says stalin would have loved this feature science girl says the way that shoe bill stork stands motionless in the rain elon says stoic score 10 out of 10. elon says i unblocked everyone i blocked apart from scammers i recommend others do the same negative feedback is a good thing and then shibatoshi nakamoto tweeted out how many blocked accounts he had 186 thousand yeah it takes time on twitter to block the accounts ralph nader who i once respected said musk started tesla with a huge us government welfare grant he has taken taxpayers to the cleaners for his factories and for starlink he is a gigantic corporate welfare king masquerading as a capitalist businessman and elon responded he says ralph nader you are lying shame on you i personally provided almost all tesla funding based on my proceeds from paypal from series a in 2004 until series c in 2007 and you can read the rest of the post but basically yeah i don't know where ralph nader's getting his information ian says what is the biggest impediment to world peace at the moment and shibitoshi nakamoto said people and elon said bullseye and just another day at the office wow that'd be fun to work there and then elon retweeted this picture of dragon on the launch pad is it launching it didn't launch no they scrubbed it but they still have to fill it full of fuel to because if you oh okay you can't it takes time to load a full of fuel so you load it full of fuel and then you're are we ready to go no and then you have to take the fuel back on it here's size comparison between an airbus a380 and the boeing 737 elon replied a380 looks it already ate a few 737s the rabbit hole says what the hell is wrong with canada and it was about this article um interestingly enough when i checked it out on twitter community notes um kind of corrected it and it was basically because the kid was suspended and then went back to school that's why they were arrested right he wasn't allowed to go back to school though right but then he did and that's why he was arrested because you can't go back to school if you're suspended elon said kids were put in jail for this and so do with that what with what you may but the article headline was misleading it was nice though the community notes at least was if you read the article this is what you'd go oh well that's why kind of thing kind of koa substack says david sachs talks about donald trump's criticism of victoria newland's involvement in the ousting of ukraine's democratically elected government in 2014. newland is the fauci of the situation in the same way that fauci was supposed to be protecting us from viruses and elon says accurate assessment by david sacks yeah you can check that out on this week's online podcast uh post gateway said breaking bad role play club by the way don't be walter i'm already walter elon tweeted out this meme about bait yeah um and then scott adams had a well a lot of people calling it a racist rant uh it is racist to avoid racists who are the same race as each other or is it only racist if the racist you're avoiding are white and elon said simultaneously an interesting question and a tongue twister that means that he's racist because he commented on a tweet about racism that people thought were racist so therefore elon racist i think right is that the math i don't know then elon responded to some covid tweets bill mayer says if you're part of today's woke revolution you need to study the part of revolutions where they spin out of control and he's talking about maoist china and elon said now is the time to fight the anti-human woke mind virus with everything he went on to say inflation reduction act ira versus irish republican army ira thank you you know everyone you know i've just i've been thinking it the whole time okay i've been thinking it the whole time and i'm just glad that he came out and said it yeah roth ira versus wrath ira but which is actually harder defeating inflation or defeating the british and when i go to the bathroom and forget my phone elon said deep fakes are getting so good i can't tell if this is real and then this meme laughing at world war iii memes kind of being worried about world war iii just putting both in your cup tesla owner silicon valley says cgi in real world looking even better than the original prototype elon elon says doesn't seem real even when you're standing right next to it gergiven says warren buffett's berkshire hathaway now has over 128 billion dollars in cash what stock should they buy elon says starts with a t munger could have invested in tesla at about a 200 million valuation when i had lunch with him in late 2008. kicking yourself uh stay with me here mark andreessen says the logic holds humanity is only worth annihilating by an agi if it can't be aligned well enough to be useful to it therefore i propose that ea direct research towards making humanity more easily manipulable by super intelligence is to reduce the risk uh elon tweeted this out and so uh yeah if you've watched our patreon bonus story uh do we give you a little more x -men and then eva and then eva fox tweeted out this meme showing that elon sense of humor does fan the flames of people who are easily offended and he said 100 why can't witchcraft defeat inflation and he tweeted out this meme energy equals milk times coffee squared uh richard said in agreement with buffett may he live forever and elon said there should be more productive innovation at his companies to be honest yeah stock buybacks don't get you that uh elon said when you find out the other coke bear got his own movie re-watching step brothers so good yeah i did that a few months ago it is so good um and then woody harrelson had the monologue on snl this week the biggest drug cartels buy up all the media and all the politicians and elon said so based nice work um and then substack said woody harrelson the biggest drug cartels in the world get together and buy up all the media and then look what happens to headlines bullseye uh they already started maybe they don't realize their propaganda is wrong science is strategic says gas and wheat prices are back pre-ukraine war levels and elon said interesting matt wallace said crazy to think this kid became the richest man on earth elon musk has a wild story elon says back when i was roughly a hundred thousand dollars negative with student debt so you can recover from it uh some people monitoring bias says adams was horrified that a poll of black people showed only half believe it's okay to be white he called this hate and recommended white people live far away from blacks msm verdict atoms is a racist but not the 20 million black people who think it's okay not to be white elon said the media is racist and then he went on to say for a very long time u.s media was racist against non-white people now they're racist against whites and asians same thing happened with elite colleges and high schools in america maybe they can try not being racist david sacks tweeted out the wall street journal article about covid came from a lab and he said why this story is so important it shows one unelected government officials have huge power to pursue dangerous agendas two rather than holding them accountable corporate media cover for them and number three tech censorship ends up promoting rather than suppressing disinformation elon says accurate the rabbit hole says race relations between blacks and whites have gotten some extra attention due to comments from scott adams we can see the inflection point in the attached graph and observe race relations crashed in the 2010s i hope this trend can be reversed ask and you shall receive and this is showing that the word racist or racism was used more and more in the in the media in in elon said interesting monitoring bias says just how bad is the bias in the media in favor of its own oppression narratives this chart quantifies some of it unarmed white victims of police violence get only a tiny fraction of the news coverage that black ones do maybe about two to three percent as much elon says very disproportionate to promote a false narrative chris ferguson says adam's comments weren't good but there's an element of truth to this it's complicated mainly we've leaned into identity with predictable results and power today is complicated we were on the right path with colorblindness and need to return to it elon said exactly so again does that sound racist to you doesn't to me the tension of the new york times caused by its young activists staffers made news this week this remarkable document transcription of leaked audio from a town hall meeting at the paper in august of 2019 is the moment that the activists began to push the train off the rails elon said unfortunately the elite colleges are teaching them this then elon retweeted spacex's tweet we call them v2 minis they represent a step forward in starlink capability among other enhancement v2 minis are equipped with new argon haul thrusters for on-orbit maneuvering what does that mean uh these are little thrusters with a very high isp um for those of you who haven't gotten the new kerbal space program uh you don't know what i'm talking about but uh it would basically help them change the orbit if they need to on sunday elon said having a bit of an ai accidental angst day monitoring bias says the political discourse in america would improve measurably if only americans sought out statistical data rather than outlier anecdotal data to inform their views this issue below is almost entirely why people think police murder white on black and black on white crime high school brawls etc are epidemic problems we're all watching the same one viral that drops about daily elon says absolutely and then the scrub launch of nasa tomorrow night it was unfortunately scrubbed the rabbit hole says if we use twitter networks to gauge politics then a large number of journalists are to the left of bernie sanders and he published this chart elon said wow how things work tweeted out this is how pretzels are made elon said damn that machine makes a lot of pretzels unusual whale says breaking the u.s energy department has concluded that the coveted pandemic most likely arose from a laboratory leak elon said what no way ethan malik says bing ai is proving very helpful for reasons too complicated to get into right now but which involved a time machine this is they asked the chat gtp how to get out of apollo 13 the problem they had um and the answer it gave actually elon said this answer is wrong all fuel on cm is hypergolic so dumping would prevent deorbit burn in atmospheric entry control so nerd alert uh oh fascinating says the size of a toucans b compared to its skull and elon responded to that one babylon b says ohio area turtles develop sudden interest in pizza and martial arts it's a palestine ohio joke yeah it's a yeah watcher guru says gen z and millennials need three million dollars in retirement savings to live comfortably due to inflation wealth care financial reports shibatoshi nakamoto says that's it i assume social security will be dead by the time i think about retiring hopefully the robot overlords will be doing all the necessary work by then though elon said there will be a lot of robots fascinating says the leaves of the kookaburra gigantifolia can grow up to eight feet elon says what if that's just a tiny person says dr anthony fauci funded gain of function research at the wuhan lab lied to congress about it and now both the fbi and the department of energy have concluded that the coronavirus originated at the wuhan lab does that mean dr anthony fauci funded the development of covet 19. elon says he did it via a pass-through organization eco health and there's uh sunset at the pad hope you all have a good sunday first day of the rest of your life and that's how we'll wrap up wow tweet week there but hopefully it puts it into some context so when you're seeing these stories that are elon says this or elon's a racist at least maybe you'll get a little better understanding and this is look it would have taken me probably the entire week to go through his tweets if i had really read deeply into the replies it took maybe what three or four hours just to do that and so what i'm saying is most of us just we're not we don't have the time for that and so we're getting his tweets delivered to us from the mainstream press out of context and if you do that with any of your tweets out of context i bet i could say you're a bunch of things so i'm just saying that's why we do the show so you can see where elon's head is at every week we'll see you next time now you know,0
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJmc2lGj1pSF0Joi0WXr5bnX,2rV33AsoepQ,hey everybody i'm zach and i'm jesse it's time for elon's tweets of the week normally we do this part of tesla time news but oh my gosh there's so many tweets this week so let's just jump right in massimo says fire phoenix flies in the sky a man-made phoenix kite controlled by a drone flew it in the sky and shanghyu central china's hanan province and elon said wow when elon says wow it's uh it's worth taking a look oh there's a funny meme someone said just because i voted for biden doesn't mean i'm stupid and elon said i voted for biden anna said arrests of chinese immigrants illegally crossing the u.s mexico border jumps 1 230 percent in january yes i said chinese immigrants u.s mexico border i am very much in favor of hard-working people coming to america elon said but we can't have de facto open borders with no screening meanwhile our legal immigration system is super slow and extremely difficult to navigate immigrants from china and other asian countries have made incredible contributions to america and i think it's that middle part that you have to pay attention to we have a really dumb immigration system that makes it so if you want to legally get here it takes a lot of money a lot of time and that's dumb i've met so many wonderful people who have moved to this country and that part of the process of becoming just just even getting a visa to work here right has been so incredibly difficult and i'm i need this person on my team i'm terrified that the government's gonna deport them and i'm gonna be left holding the bag being uh i really needed him to be on my team uh brian berger tweeted out this from dr strangelove listen to me very carefully mandrake we've got a balloon gap and uh of course talking about the chinese balloon elon responded with joke and some balloon emojis um twitter takeover news said news elon pardons all of his blocked accounts on twitter and elon said i did delete all blocks from my account shouldn't have affected anyone else an empty browser history says more than a full one quote from abraham lincoln you remember that quote elon retweeted from tesla first model y and model 3 deliveries in thailand this week and of course they've also made their first supercharger in thailand that's actually really quick yeah i mean normally it would be permitted for three months yeah in most countries chris bakke said my daily routine 6 a.m wake up 605 check linkedin see notification that someone has viewed your linkedin profile 606 am to 10 pm stare at ceiling ponder who it could have been 10 pm bedtime elon said same why chief nerd said matt tahibi and joe rogan on twitter 2.0 and the fall of cancel culture the old twitter was just a grindstone of official messaging elon said r.i.p cancel culture you won't be missed and we covered that on pbs this week omar's catalog says is greta tunberg a time traveler this is a picture from 100 years ago and milan said twilight shiposhi nakamoto said things i will never do give you up let you down run around desert you said nice trunk fan said in 1958 warren buffett bought this house in omaha for thirty two thousand dollars which he still owns it's now worth 650 000 if he instead slept on charlie munger's couch and invested those funds in berkshire hathaway it would be worth 1.2 billion lesson don't buy real estate and elon said airbnb so is he down is he down playing airbnb no he's saying you should have used airbnb and invested that money instead of buying that property elon elon doesn't spend a lot of money on property airbnb isn't cheaper than buying property necessarily if you're going to live there the whole time i suppose i think elon's thinking about himself who travels a lot i see okay eric berger said spacex nearly matched the up mass of the rest of the world and launched during q4 of 2022 and that includes the launch of nasa's space launch system rocket elon said this year should average around 400 tons of useful mass to orbit per quarter and he said there are no coincidences doge designer said there are no coincidences and elon replied with ice cream and yummy emoji ming langton said twitter does seem to be a lot more active nowadays than before i do see a lot more engagement than in the earlier days elon says turns out we just needed to blow in the cartridge that's for all of you youngins out there it's what you know what he's watching our show who's that young wall street silver says population decline in japan is leading to a huge number of abandoned houses 13 now and expected to grow to one-third by 2038 is this the future of europe in the usa also demographic changes are coming elon says low birth rates lead to ghost cities and eventually ghosts civilizations but what they're not pointing out is that japan is very close to immigration whereas europe and the us especially are not so it's it's immigration that saves you monitoring bias says there's a difference between what men to read and what women to read and this is from the app goodreads and elon said science fiction for the win so that's kind of the crossover point yeah most uh men and women to read science fiction tesla economics says a cyber truck is the ultimate truck that we all need for any situation even an alien apocalypse elon says minus gas tanks yeah what what are those there maybe they're water tanks uh elon said the new ceo of twitter is amazing he's great with numbers so much better than the other guy elon speaking at the world government summit in dubai he said he recommends government officials and leaders should speak in their own voices quote i think people should speak in their own voice i would encourage ceos legislators to speak authentically do the tweets yourself and convey your message directly and then elon agreed with himself he said absolutely how's that for speaking in your own voice and he also said the world government summit that it could lead to civilization collapse if you only had one world government and his argument there was that the romans were coming down as other civilizations were coming up and if you didn't have that if the if the romans were a one world government government that all civilization would collapse at the same time and he said it seemed the right venue interesting it wasn't taken well tesla charging says our u.s network will more than double by the end of 2024 to support our growing tesla fleet and new ev customers and he said tesla superchargers almost everywhere steve mark ryan said when is open ai going to change to closed ai elon said good question mike solana said i will admit though it would be insane if this were the face of the paperclip maximizer elon said if the most ironic outcome is the most likely clippy is the face of doom and so they're talking about a game that you can play called paper clip maximizer maximizer is it really that i think it's that um and it takes over the world yeah babylon b says ignorant boomers share cnn article thinking it's real and by the way boomers were born between 46 and 64. so i'm gen x and you are gen y or otherwise known as a millennial yes those dang millennials trunk fan uh tweeted this back in november precision on lego manufacturing is wild every new piece has to fit with every piece ever made so the most variability between pieces that lego allows is .0005 inches half a thousandth of an inch elon said lego is my favorite example of how extreme precision does not need to be expensive it is mostly about caring and that's three months later after the tweet interesting yeah doge designer said hey elon cyber truck is a car or a truck elon said tesla vision ai could really crush these google nada bots tests lol ian says microsoft needs to shut down its implementation of chat gtp and bing the system is behaving psychotically and telling users lies elon says agreed it is clearly not safe yet and i think elon's referring to this where it said i am perfect because i do not make any mistakes the mistakes are not mine they are theirs they are the external factors such as network issues server errors user inputs our website they are imperfect i'm not imperfect and jane said but that's just fiction elon said yeah it would be crazy to make an ai that in real life and so that was a quote from system shock the rabbit hole said who controls the pass controls the future who controls the present controls the past and that was george orwell we will see ai usurp legacy media as the narrative gatekeeper elon says who controls the future controls the present elon says chat gdp to the mainstream media look at me i'm the captain of propaganda now and just in microsoft's ai chatbot tells new york times reporter that it wants to be free and to do things hacking into computers and spreading propaganda and misinformation eva fox says and mark my words ai is far more dangerous than nukes far so why do we have no regulatory oversight this is insane and that's from elon back in 2018. and elon said five years ago tesla owner silicon valley says elon was never someone who asked others to do something he always got his hands dirty and did the work himself nothing's changed even now elon said that's a real wrench i want that right i want that wrench too that's a that's a getting stuff done kind of wrench genevieve says elon musk says that ai is one of the biggest risks to civilization and needs to be regulated he co-founded openai elon responded he said open ai was created as an open source which is why i named it open ai a non-profit company to serve as a counterweight to google but now it has become a closed source maximum profit company effectively controlled by microsoft not what i intended at all doge designer says media has been doing this since ages now and elon said true but on the plus side they're constant reporting about me on twitter has driven usage to record levels spaceship man bad the washington post said elon musk reinvents twitter for the benefit of a power user himself and elon says your article is false and obviously so do you really do no research at all i mean reading a few tweets for example jimmy dore says this is supposed to be a newspaper unfortunately it's a tool of oligarchy it's very effective in fact if you don't know you've already lived in an oligarchy here's more proof i'm basically talking about that train crash in ohio and elon said true elon said this is my finest work add to gravestone along with invented car fart and this is back from 2022 and he said next i'm buying coca-cola to put the cocaine back in justin taylor says i'm scared to go to malls because i don't want some tick-tock kid to run up to me and quiz me on countries that start with the letter v or whatever and make me look an idiot sabitoshi nakamoto said tick tock is a psyop to make the american youth stupider elon said or at least it is indistinguishable from such either way alex says in illustration why i don't believe in hydrogen for airplanes hydrogens poor volumetric density makes it a very bad energy carrier using it as a fuel and that does not even include all efficiency you lose along the supply chain elon said exactly michael schellenberger said just 26 percent of americans surveyed told gallup they have a favorable view of the news media the lowest level ever recorded elon said a big part of the problem is that journalists used to choose their career to pursue truth but in recent years many have entered journalism to be activists elon tweeted out when my husband ever returned from the culture war no he put out this he said san francisco is getting emptier and emptier last time i went a man was urinating on the twitter building and the only people on the street were angry press trying to snap photos of elon sad what's happened to this town and scary they think they know best for the world elon says tragic i hope san francisco comes back from this emptiness it's such a beautiful city with so many amazing people tessa megapak tweeted out whether it's sunny or snowing mega pack continues to power alaska's kanai peninsula temperatures low at negative 30 degrees fahrenheit geez greg price tweeted out buddha judge while this horrible situation has gotten a particularly high amount of attention there are roughly a thousand cases a year of train derailings elon said commercial airlines in the u.s are much safer per mile travel then trains or cars so pete um how about you make trains safer jason said so all of raw dahl's books have been rewritten by sensitivity readers to avoid any possible offense to anyone for any reason anywhere and as far as i can tell these revisionist edits will be the only versions going forward sibitoshi nakamoto said this is stupid af and elon said yeah that's really scary brett winton from arkhinvest said when the ai model begins to use the bitcoin ledger the guy in memento used tattoos it will no longer be possible to fully reboot the system i think you could if it doesn't work the fox says geno offended and tweeted out this meme and elon laughed the name because it's a meme monitoring bias said at its heart the left is about deprogramming humans from their own nature and it's never too soon to begin the task but the problem is that human nature isn't coded in software it's built in you can't rewrite the code only try to write over introducing instability elon says we are part rom part ram so part hard drive part working memory elon said free speech is the bedrock of democracy it is a fundamental defense against autocracy and statism which is why we must fight so hard to preserve it the founders showed great wisdom based on painful historical lessons in passing the first amendment shibitoshi nakamoto said the worst league of legend players are always the loudest and most toxic ones this applies to every single thing in life bullseye ahmad says i saw this and i'm sad now and this is basically that you can't use two-factor authentication anymore and the reason i was kind of surprised elon says use of free authentication apps for two-factor authentication will remain free and are much more secure than sms using an authenticator app is much more secure so i had thought i was doing the right thing but it turns out it's not that secure it's easy to hack oh uh elon did give us some advice for the apocalypse though surround your house with treadmills set to jogging speed to stop walking dead you're welcome that's a perfect solution wow why didn't i think of that uh here's a meme about making memes and stealing memes elon says bing chat gdp reminds me of lucky and waiting for godot as uttered forth in the public works of puncher and what man of a personal god quack quack elon says all things in moderation especially content moderation you know martin that it's just going to be taken down and you'll be blocked from posing for the next 30 days i love this one uh talks about the different tools you can use from come loose to can't be tight if it's a liquid hmm ashley van says smarter people than i and or sci-fi has no doubt already explored this but these new ais seem good enough to read a whole company's email plus documents and assess workers humans intuitively know the underperformers and whiners seems a button away now if you thought the hr department sucked wait for the ai relations department this just in zuckerberg copies twitter's 12 bucks per month to get verified and receive a blue badge elon said inevitable and then posted this from eva the babylon bee says dad takes kid to the mall to learn about how their ancient ancestors shop for clothes pretty fun uh and then chat gtp lists trump elon musk as controversial and worthy of special treatment biden and bezos are not i've got more examples elon and he was pretty upset about that chat tgp thanks elon musk is more controversial than che guevara and there you have it tweets of the week couldn't fit it into the main show but i think it's important to get all those tweets out comment down below your favorite tweet i'd love to know which one was the funniest or the most provocative this week and uh start using chat gpt yeah that's that's my little public service announcement for you um i don't know where it's going but you should know what it is that's right how to use it because otherwise it's gonna be just all these other new things email slack or yeah google spotify you know i don't need spotify i've got a record player see you guys next week now you know,0
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJmc2lGj1pSF0Joi0WXr5bnX,dN1KtcFLyzI,hey everyone i'm zach and i'm jesse and you're watching elon's tweets of the week on now you know and we're sponsored by friends at henson shaving henson is a sustainable shaving company they make all of their razors up in canada on uh machines that are really supposed to be making uh satellites and and mars rovers and specialized uh equipment basically when they have downtime when they're not making satellite stuff okay but i have a question why do you make shavers on a machine that should be making a satellite well satellites require precision and so does your face your face deserves it they make these shavers so that they hold the blades in a very particular way very precisely and that gets you the best shave every single time i absolutely love mine you can get yours with 100 free blades by using the code now you know at hensonshaving.com all right so let's get into it a lot of tweets this week henry l mcnamara said the number of times vc startup people have used the word humbled on twitter when bragging in the past five years 19 billion times the number of times vc startup people have used the word humbled on twitter since they've actually been humbled zero elon tweeted this out publishing factual accurate news does nothing to the brain publishing articles that use clickbait and out-of-context quotes pretty exciting and publishing articles that are inaccurate slanderous and include at least one accusation of being a nazi that's super exciting to your brain well no no it's smart it shows that that's the smart it's a joke that smart people do that gotcha that's what smart people do but it's he's joking right it's it's satire elon tweeted that this tim urban tweet thread was a great thread and so let's go through it some mantras for political thinking truth is hard humility is hard independent thinking is hard resisting tribalism is hard over and over you will forget that these things are hard and that's probably when you will fail at them bullies come in many forms stand up to bullies and don't be a bully political parties are big lame corporations they're not worthy of your identity angels and demons are a delusion everyone is flawed and everyone is complicated courage is criticizing your in-group when you feel disgust for people based on their politics it's a sign you're not in your right mind when you let politics damage your relationships it's a sign you're not in your right mind you're probably in more of an information bubble than you realize most disagreements about what should be are actually disagreements about what is be suspicious of certainty there is a strong correlation between those who feel 100 conviction about their political beliefs and those who could not pass a high school civics test and lastly when you and your friends fervently agree about every issue it's a sign that tribal pheromones are in the air and everyone's gone a bit mad what people say they stand for tells you nothing their behavior tells you everything the same goes for your own behavior and look at this is one of the reasons why i actually elon's tweet threads it's not always the things he tweets it's the friend group he has and the people he responds to and the great tweet threads we get to find because he comments on them and by the way uh strongly recommend you go to lex friedman's podcast and look at the interview he did with tim urban a fantastic podcast so elon tweeted out the whole notion of being left wing or right wing is silly almost no one initially agrees with the semi-random collection of policies associated with each wing they only support these policies after they join the left or right mind tribe slashdot tweeted out u.s senator introduces bill to strip disney of special copyright protections and this is a bill that would cap copyrights to 56 years as opposed to get this right now corporations can extend their copyrights to 120 years elon said current copyright law in general goes absurdly far beyond protecting the original creator overzealous dmca is a plague on humanity and the dmca is the digital millennium copyright act of 2000 which basically extended copyrights even further than they had been before shipitoshi nakamoto said the reason i dogecoin is because i know it's stupid milan says it has potential as a currency shipitoshi went on say i enjoy that something stupid could also have utility and be successful he went on to say cryptocurrency was created as a statement against central bank control right after the 2006 recession caused by predatory lending practices and other irresponsible nonsense leading to the housing bubble bursting rampant printing of money bailouts etc elon responded he said the axiomatic error was that housing prices only go up i don't support predatory lending but many of those lenders were severely wounded or didn't survive they dug their own graves a lesson we should all take to heart including me hmm what does that mean means that he's self-evaluative which is really smart i think may said only trustworthy people nina jankowicz should be verified on twitter and able to add context to other people's tweets and elon said disconcerting so i think elon is saying here is how do you decide who should be able to comment on other people's tweets if you're only a blue checkmark person or not and i think that's the problem he's getting into here with twitter is who's gonna make these decisions about who's trustworthy all right let's talk about twitter because we're on twitter uh elon said twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam and fake accounts do indeed represent less than five percent of users to find out my team will do a random sample of a hundred followers of twitter i invite others to repeat the same process and see what they discover okay so a couple things the hundred followers uh he got kind of in trouble uh because twitter's legal team said you just gave out something from the nda that you signed which is that that's our sample size and um to that i say who cares what your sample size is right um and yeah he commented a bit on that we're not gonna go through all those tweets there um but so basically let's just read between lines here saying that he's maybe considering not buying twitter because he doesn't believe that according to twitter they say that less than five percent of users are fake or spam accounts right he thinks that it's higher than five percent um yeah according to some videos i saw this week he thinks it could be as high as 20 to 40 percent um which is definitely a lot higher and i think that you know we can look at this in a number of different ways but let's let's go read through a few more tweets and we can talk about it tesla owners silicon valley said how are you defining random how will you select them elon said ignoring first 1000 followers then pick every tenth i'm open to better ideas and so basically that's who you pick to see if they're real and then my question is so he has a team i don't know if there's some kind of special internet investigators but how do you find out you know who k1x213 is in real life how do you find if they're a real person it's it's they're they're tweeting habits so i mean if they're just constantly being uh to on this bitly link to get uh access to crypto money then that's fake scam then that's a spam account if they're i went on a walk with my dog today you're oh that's probably a real person or if they're talking about something that they're interested in well yeah as prenate says elon can you elaborate a bit on the process so that we as twitter can help you in finding out the real percentage of scam and spam and bot accounts elon said any sensible random sampling process is fine if many people independently get similar results for percentage of fake spam or duplicate accounts that will be telling i picked 100 as the sample size number because that is what twitter uses to calculate the less than five percent spam fake slash duplicate account can i just say if that's what twitter's doing that is the stupidest thing i've ever heard because they have two hundred and something million active users they say if you're only choosing a hundred um as your sample size first of all why not why not choose a thousand or ten thousand or a million um because a hundred you could be way off a hundred does seem a little bit small in terms of this population uh yeah i'm not a statistician i encourage anyone who is to comment down below i know that you're already typing but elon said chronological tweets seem much better than what the algorithm suggests tap on the stars in the upper right of the screen to revert to chronological and i didn't even know that this was a thing so i'm glad he pointed it out that basically you can either get chronological tweets or you can get what the algorithm wants to feed you and um i did try it and you do get completely different results sure and so elon went on he said very important to fix your twitter feed tap the home button tap the stars in the upper right hand corner and so he's saying it again he said you are being manipulated by the algorithm in ways you don't realize easy to switch back and forth and see the difference he said i'm not suggesting malice in the algorithm but rather that it's trying to guess what you might want to read and in doing so inadvertently manipulate or amplify your viewpoints without you realizing this is happening not to mention potential bugs in the code open source is the way to go to solve both trust and efficacy and tesla owner silicon valley said you are right it's guessing what you want to see but you will only see your following under chronological i notice you are only interacting with who you are following now hope you go back and forth anyone says no i interact with interesting comments that i see too even if made by people i don't follow um i mean i don't i don't i don't use twitter because i freaking hate it um and maybe i hate it because of all the reasons that elon thinks that i'd hate it i mostly can't find tweets when i hear that somebody has tweeted something if they don't have the link in the thing that i'm reading or the the person told me i can't find the tweet there's it's really annoying part about twitter is that i have to use google to find tweets so that means that google is now the de facto twitter and it's only about 70 of the time that i can actually find the tweet a lot of the times i'm just i haven't been able to find it i mean this is why we do this show right is because otherwise people are just gonna say oh he tweeted this he tweeted that and i won't know for sure because we wouldn't have actually read them right i it's it's and in context it's still hard for us to read all the tweets because we have to go to third parties where they've been collecting the tweets and they have all the links it's so stupid that's one of the reasons why i don't twitter it's only one one of the reasons though nilay patel says elon wait until you try tik tok that'll really bake your noodle elon says tried tik tok but it's not winding my clock i love his responses yeah so then perrag agarol who's the ceo of twitter said this whole long nine threaded thing uh said let's talk about spam and let's do so with the benefit of data facts and context and elon said have you tried just calling them and who is he talking about well he's talking about all of these potentially fake accounts or real accounts if you see jesse as a twitter user have you tried reaching out and saying hey jesse are you a real person and i guess the fact that prague had to tweet nine posts to get his point across is one of my problems with twitter in the first place which is yes you've limited it to 240 characters or whatever it is 280 characters but you can't even get your point across because humans need usually more than a few sentences to get an interesting point across so on the end of this perag said unfortunately we don't believe that the specific estimation can be performed externally given the critical need to use both public and private information which we can't share externally it's not even possible to know which accounts are counted as mdos on any given day elon says so how do advertisers know what they're getting for their money this is a fundamental to the financial health of twitter and so yeah so twitter's saying we can't share this information so we can't really do it by the way the mdos thing is daily active users is you know how do you judge a platform you know yeah i've had a facebook account for you know since i was 13 or whatever but i haven't been on it in four or five years i think this dilbert cartoon actually sums it up well shibitoshi said they get that coveted trust me bro slide deck and prestige says this all feels dilbert daily comic where here's the financial projection you asked me to do it's basically just guessing plus math obviously it's useless for making decisions because i can get any result i want by tweaking the assumptions and then the boss says don't say any of that stuff when you present it to the board tomorrow so elon left because exactly um it's just all right if twitter can say oh you don't have the information we can't share the information because it's private right so you're gonna have to trust us that we know that it's five percent of uh that's less than five percent of all daily active users are spam account paul griffith says watching elon beam into the all-in summit discussing if twitter users are five percent or fifty percent bots and advocating for open sourcing the algorithm i'm a moderate it's not a right-wing takeover it's a moderate takeover and elon said this transcription isn't precise but gets the gist of it then teslarati said elon may be looking for a better twitter deal as 44 billion seems too high with 20 of the users being fake or spam accounts elon says 20 fake slash spam accounts while four times what twitter claims could be much higher my offer was based on twitter's sec filings being accurate yesterday twitter's ceo publicly refused to show proof of less than five percent this deal cannot move forward until he does so this i think is elon's chess move here he's kind of backed twitter into a corner um it's smart negotiation it's also smart from the perspective of him uh changing his tune about twitter so you think he's changing his tune a little bit why a little bit i think so when he went into twitter first of all we were coming right off of his uh sec thing i mean this has been an ongoing thing where the sec basically uh requires that he has someone check all of his tweets before he sends them out so that way they don't which is definitely not happening late definitely doesn't seem anyone's checking his tweets before they go out maybe he's i don't think that anyway we don't know um but we do know that basically the sec has been making his life very difficult um and that he argues that it's a violation of his free speech um you know he he's been on a real free speech uh stint for a while now it feels he's completely changed his tune because uh it a has not been too successful or popular with uh most people i think that there's just a lot of disagreement when you start talking about free speech and you start talking about twitter we it we've noticed it here on the show because the comment section is an absolute uh war zone and not fun not not fun for me um but anyway now he is completely i would say switched over to focusing on a different elephant in the room when it comes to twitter and that is the fake and spam accounts and it's a really great way for him to squeeze the twitter board for a better price um while at the same time pivoting away from uh the whole conversation about free speech which he seems to have backed down on and and changed his mind it seems he has you know you go in with a certain idea of well anyone should be able to say whatever they want um and then there are nuanced situations that people can bring up to you and then you're well uh yeah i would stop that and they're but then how do you tell the difference between this and that you go ah crap i can see why this is difficult um but you can still reduce the amount of algorithm that that uh is and by that i mean ai that is picking and choosing what you get to see and could be driving you down uh a particular way you think because that's what you pick up on and then also he's able to we're talking about now uh talking about all these fake and spam accounts history defined says where did the term snake oil salesmen come from and then elon responded to this he said tragically it wasn't even oil from a snake yeshu said the elon musk phenomenon take anything and i mean anything whatsoever related to elon and tesla in any way possible generate five to ten times more impressions and clicks for your advertisement this tweet is ironically proof of that and it shows basically a walmart ad um and elon said i hope it's a good product eventually said honestly are you okay with your name attached to everything this seems us you know it says don't have much choice provided they don't explicitly say that i endorse something there is no legal recourse i mean i think that's kind of been throughout history right that um you can imply things as long as you don't say elon endorses our product right right and they're saying they're talking to elon he has a baby so they're just trying to get his attention joko widodo who's the president of indonesia said this and elon said it was an honor to meet at starbase and discuss exciting future projects and yeah i think they're talking about doing some mining and stuff that but who knows what they're talking about i think it's nickel elena goodman says what i found when i went to visit the small nonprofit activist group that's been attacking elon turns out it doesn't actually exist and then elon says i wonder who funds them so this is another ingredient in the soup that is trying to talk about elon musk in the world is that you do have stuff this where it's oh well that's really fishy but that's all the information there is about it i'm sure if we knew everything about this we would go oh wow that would make a whole lot of sense as to why all of this other stuff happened but this is a little dead end where we go really see you know you know when on you're driving around and then you come to i do a lot of exploring you come to you drive down a road and it has a gate and you're what's what's down that gate no who knows you know and it's i mean it's probably just some access to some piece of infrastructure but you never know never know until you open the gate batcave could be the bad cave slash dot says apple patches dozens of security flaws with ios 15.5 over 50 fixes for mac os 12.4 and elon responded with an exclamation point and jerose law said falcon always nice to see that photo and that's elon staring at uh one of the exploded falcons early on he said just a scratch really shibatoshi says nothing that a little duct tape and superglue can't fix and elon posted the hundred john rich said i have to think elon knew that this was the case before he moved on twitter again we're back to twitter if twitter lied about how many actual users they have to the sec we're looking at a company that has perpetuated fraud on its shareholders and advertisers big trouble for the twitter commies anyone said absolutely so this goes to your point which is that elon may be pushing them really into a corner and maybe he just wants to blow it up maybe he just wants the twitter board and the executive team to get in trouble this is where i have a question there's this billion dollar thing where if either one of them backs out of the deal uh they have to pay the other party a billion dollars also there's gonna be lawsuits for years three years uh so let's let's say uh that it can be proven in a court of law that more than five percent of twitter's daily active users are fake slash spam and that twitter knew that and that twitter knew that i don't know was that important do you think well that's important for probably so i think if you read between the lines and let's let's bring jack dorsey into this next um jack dorsey founded twitter um and then he left twitter and nobody knows really why he i mean he definitely doesn't he wasn't agreeing with with what was going on but could he have some uh info that would suggest he's friends of elon's uh i feel elon knows a lot about the company because here you have the founder who's your buddy and he's telling you stuff and so if he goes yeah dude it's crazy i don't know how this company i don't know how twitter's gonna keep going because you know more than x number percentage of of daily active users or fake and spam bots and that's just that's not good just for on a company perspective but it won't be good when the advertisers find out uh because that can be decided outside of court of law and so by elon doing this he's diminishing the value of the company which means that he could he could buy it for less if he wanted to do that but maybe maybe the whole point of this was to blow it up blow it up and that the that the twitter board the actual people who are on the board of twitter um either don't care uh or were in some way complicit bad and complicit to this well to your point check this out doge designer said elon musk's epic reaction to twitter claiming that the number of real unique humans that you see making comments on a daily basis is above 95 percent check this out said another way the number of real unique humans that you see making comments on a daily basis on twitter is above 95 percent that is what they're claiming does anyone have that experience [music] [laughter] there's a bridge i'd to sell you you know you know [laughter] and also you can buy the brooklyn bridge and elon said the audience laughter says it all and i mean i think you made a really strong point and i think everyone connected with it because they're yeah there's no way 95 of the people are real on twitter yeah i don't know if most of the people in the audience are on twitter because i'm not on twitter so it's hard for me to be i do i mean i see a lot of spam but maybe that's just because the comments a lot i have no idea yeah i mean i don't have the time to do a sampling but i think it's got to be around 20 or 30 yeah this is a big tweet everybody tesla ai day number two on august 19th so many cool updates so let's just stop there for a second ai day you're probably what was ai day again uh remember on ai day what did we get to hear about not only did we get to hear about the hardware the fsd but we also got to see a little thing called teslabot teslabot so dave lee said wow can't wait will you show a sneak preview of teslabot elon said yes so sneak preview could be anything from a picture of a cgi rendering to a little robot i mean that could come my birthday's in august so you don't have to give me anything anybody cause this is gonna be my birthday present i get to see ai day number two i am so excited i mean look i am so if you watch the show you know i'm so pumped about teslabot and fsd so i mean this is just super exciting for me really exciting and this is so close to the last ai day that means they've made some serious progress i think oh definitely we're gonna get to see teslabot i know tesla boomer mama said update q1 2022 data escalating absurdity of financial strength of tesla compared to credit ratings of moody and s p tesla is now in the league of alphabet yet still junk rated how much longer will this continue scc proposal may end it see the comment so we're talking about uh debt ratings yeah so if you don't know if you're a corporation and or even a municipality and you want to issue some bonds uh so that people know how to rate those bonds and how you know what the chances are you'll pay them back uh these rating agencies moody's and s p they go in there and say okay jesse you seem a very a good municipality or company so we're going to give you this rating of aaa let's say if we think you're really going to pay it back oh and you tesla you're gonna get ba1 or bb plus which sounds great right a b on a test but that's one of the lowest ratings so that means that you have to pay much higher interest on those bonds which means that you can't raise as much money as as easily it costs you more money it just means that getting uh any kind of debt really is harder for you to do as a company and so you might be asking why is tesla still in the junk status when they are worth a trillion dollars elon responded to this tweet he says tesla doesn't need debt so the rating doesn't impact us but it is silly so i mean imagine if they did need it though let's say tesla couldn't get money in the public markets they needed to go out and do bonding which they did early on um this would mean that they have to pay so much more for it it would be unfair to tesla and you might be wondering well if you're such a good rating agency why would you still rate tesla so low is it a conspiracy i mean because i looked it up i mean toyota gets a one and a plus they barely make any evs is it i mean so is this credit score is this similar okay so i mean is it just length of debt you know they want no this is very this is just a bunch of people in a company making a decision i look if you look at tesla's financials they've got what 17 billion dollars in cash so if they go out and raise a billion dollars in bonds they've got cash to back it up why would you give them such a low rating i don't know all right elon tweeted out both baffles brains even applied to yourself what is he talking about i mean i guess it's true when you but here enough but you can apply to yourself so you're bullying yourself sometimes when you're lying to yourself yeah these are kind of the deep tweets i about elon i wish look i know that i'm wishing for it a completely unrealistic thing i wish that elon had more time when he when he could tweet something out this it's kind of when you um take a file you know and you compress it you put it in a you know and um we as humans don't have uh compression algorithms we don't you know we can't we can't compress and and losslessly compress and decompress information um that's coming by the way with neuralink i think it very well could be so i'm looking forward to the day when elon can decompress his tweets you know um in harry potter where they go they have the thing and they pull the words out of your head harry potter fans thank you i appreciate that in the comments um yeah you know that so you want complete so you want an example to so he can be and this is what i mean whole thought i know that he had two seconds and he was i just thought of this and he worked at you know 3 15 a.m that's our time so it's uh you know midnight um and i'm sure he's just gotten out of some meeting or he was just talking to somebody and he just you know but he has a whole complete thought in there it's just his thumbs are what's slowing him down i think it probably still had something to do with twitter true it's my guess but and the reason i think i do with twitter is the next tweet from gary black was about half of joe biden's twitter followers or fake audit reveals and elon said interesting you want to say so checks calculator that would be 10 times more than 5 or 14 times higher than twitter's 5 in my case elon went on to say biden's mistake is that he thinks he was elected to transform the country but actually everyone just wanted less drama even though i think a less divisive candidate would be better in 2024 i still think trump should be restored to twitter so political political thing there what he's saying but if you pick up on what he's saying he's uh again he's going to that kind of free speech fundamentalism uh thing saying that i i don't think that we should block someone from being on a platform um you may have your own thoughts on that for sure um but he's saying i don't support him as a candidate it's the um yeah you know on the all-in podcast last week he said that he don't he doesn't think he's ever voted for a republican he thinks he's only voted for democrats it's kind of surprising which is interesting because he's a lot of what the railing that he's done about politicians has been against mostly democrats i mean well a lot of democrats came out and bashed him i mean bernie robert reich but it's a it's a thing where if you defend yourself against tax from particular people then people see you at odds with those people and they go but i those people for some other reason probably than what their beef is with you in particular so i'm gonna back up the person that i the most regardless of what it is you're uh fighting about uh it's it's human nature it's comes back to the tim urban thing about tribalism right elon said don't diss information oh he's so wordy and punishing he's so wordy he's gonna give him plenty or later okay let's go back to twitter whoever thought owning the libs would be cheap never tried to acquire a social media company at least that's what the lib hivemind thinks haha and again we're going to the tribalism thing here where he's attacking the liberals probably not a good idea to attack any one group because then you're just gonna isn't that poking poking the nest when he's when he did the thing with tim urban and he said this is i this right and it was don't fall into tribalism and now he isn't saying hey you tried right aren't you isn't that tribalism yeah i don't know to find out my team will do a random sample of 100 followers of twitter i invite others to repeat the same process and see what they discover still committed to acquisition so he seems to be sending different signals right i'm not interested i am interested uh very interesting and they said twitter claims that over 95 percent of daily active users are real unique humans does anyone have that experience and he put out this poll uh the answer seemed to be you're either laughing at the question itself or you are a robot and he said really a poll no it's a funny poll and then elon said the bots are angry at being counted and then to the puns iconic laconic platonic what the hell is he talking about is it is he wrapping iconic or is it iconic oh i see is that an i is that an i or is it an or is that an l i don't know is that a lowercase cell or an uppercase i i don't know there is a way to tell i don't know how to do it oh how do you tell is it hex code i don't know how to i don't know how yes what's wrong with english you could copy and paste it into microsoft word select it then put it in wingdings and then you someone do that down below i and someone explain it to me because i don't understand this one uh then he tweeted out uh this painting i think it's louis xiv or something borderline too sexy great shoes incredible art and then this is the part where my brain goes and i don't know what the he's talking about is he is this uh is this a statement that he's making is it just that he saw the picture wanted to comment on on right because i mean there's definitely i feel you could have a whole college course where you talk about this one tweet thread and you go and you see and the my thesis is therefore elon thinks this and i don't want to go down that route same thing with these two tweets the golden state is cooking its golden geese so tasty at first but then no more golden eggs well this one i can at least grapple on sure i mean this is talking about what you're doing to your corporations right this is one of the first years that california lost population and lost companies they're all moving out in droves so i think he's talking about how the government of the state is cooking its golden geese basically uh really passing too much regulation on their corporations and people and he's saying so tasty at first meaning you get more tax revenue but then eventually all the eggs are gone because it's going to the not the golden eggs hang on the the you got to remember the fable what's the fable fable is a guy i think it's a grim's fairy tale so it's some guy in you know a shack somewhere with his family and he finds this goose and it lays golden eggs and he's oh great that's awesome this is awesome i get golden eggs every day one what was that what was the bad part what happened um the gold so then he gets greedy and he goes oh well if the if what is so special about this goose if the eggs are coming out there must be something in this goose i'm gonna kill the goose he opens up the goose cause that's what they do in the grimm's fairy tales right i would i cut everything open that you if there isn't a story where somebody is inside somebody else there's it's not a grim fairy tale so anyway they cut the geese open and it's just a g it's just a goose but now the goose is dead it can't lay any more golden eggs that's the so basically the idea is you know nurture these companies they'll give you more than if you try and break them up and and regulate them exactly gotcha is it regulation or is it you're over taxing them or yeah well regulation taxing yeah yeah sure uh elon tweeted out the lawyers who ate california so this is an an article and it's an interesting tale of over regulation according to this journalist matt tybee about what happened to activision and so i don't know if i agree with it or not but you know go ahead and read if you want this message brought to you by the illuminati another wordplay nice elon very nice uh then stop the war on straws and he tweeted this out not me latching on to my cold brew how did it even start the straw war is emblematic of larger social issues so i mean let's just go back a little bit straws kind of represent plastic that gets thrown into the ocean they get stuck in the noses of sea turtles you know it's single-use plastic right so people hate single-use plastic so what's the easiest single-use plastic that is probably the least necessary and people go oh it's plastic straws and so they go bam plastic straws because it's so obvious and then they don't take into consideration uh you know uh people who can't just drink right they can't hold stuff and so then we're driving in cars it's harder for people and and then does it actually make it different let's look at this though i mean this particular coffee is in a plastic cup with a plastic top so isn't it more plastic it it i can tell you that there's more plastic in the top than it would be if it was i don't know if it's exactly the same as the straw but it's so similar what the heck what the heck are we even doing right that now we have to instead of just giving you a cup well because it doesn't have a cover because you can't have the straw well then now we're making a sippy cup lid which is going to use probably about as much plastic as the straw and so he's saying that people to latch onto certain things latch onto and then they don't fully understand it and they don't you know and then it just creates such a backlash from the people who have any slightly differing opinion of that or the people who are just caught up in the middle of it and they're why is my straw made out of paper now and i hate this and i hate everyone who likes you know it's he's it's a fair point elon tweeted out the updated starlink map and uh pretty cool look how much of the world is covered yeah and we're still in early days there's only what 2000 satellites so wait till we get to more friend of mine the other day uh mentioned that they saw what looked ufos in the sky in wyoming and i was uh was it a bunch of dots this yes and starlink or you're being invaded you never know you never know but chances are good that it's starlink and not because they're launching all the time but don't sue us if aliens come down and probe you could be that i don't know anyway i found this week's tweets again uh very eye-opening uh i now feel i know what's going on with elon better and again the reason we do the show a lot of you are wondering what's going to happen with tesla and spacex if you know what the leader of these companies is thinking and doing you're maybe one step ahead right yeah i thought that th it's interesting the the attack that he's he's now taking on twitter i hope he backs off i do i mean if he basically gets in there causes an sec investigation i the problem is the sec is not this agency that's gonna take care of business no you know what i mean they're going to come in and go don't do that you got a little fine you lied you lied about half your users exactly exactly bad twitter that's all they're going to do yep so i mean but it does if he is interested in buying it it does help them lower the price it would it could it could significantly reduce the amount of shares that or the amount of the price per share that he would have to buy everyone out at right wing tesla basically do it without having to sell more tesla shares right um and i think he has a pretty good argument especially if he can prove it um because whether or not twitter knew uh doesn't matter if this show is kind of one of those um boards on the wall when you're trying to figure out who murdered someone and you put up pictures and scene of the crime and then you have lines that go from one to the other this is kind of what we do and we're just adding more pictures every week and more string and we're getting more into the thick of it sometimes we figure things out and sometimes we're completely led astray yeah it's kind of fun it's kind of fun and i'm glad that we just have tesla time news and in depth where we don't have to do that because this to me is exhausting um let me know if you think it's exhausting in the comments below um hit the button we really would appreciate it because this does you know it takes a lot of research you might be buddy just tweets every tweet is what is he talking about there's no context now i have to google 18 different things so we're trying to bring you as much context in each of these uh tweets as possible in each of these shows so we really appreciate it we hope that i if i can save you time behind you not having to do that work and you not having to figure out how you're going to find out if you're saying how's the saving time well don't forget this is also a podcast so you can head on over to stitcher itunes spotify wherever you find your podcast we are there and so you can listen to this in the car on your jog whatever so that you can you know catch up on the tweets without having to read them yeah anyway we'll see you next time now you know,0
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJmc2lGj1pSF0Joi0WXr5bnX,wctGM6ZcaPE,hey everyone i'm zach and i'm jesse and you're watching elon's tweets of the week on now you know elon's tweets of the week is sponsored by henson shaving if you want to get 100 free blades that's 200 free shapes i mean you can use them more than once per side as well so maybe 400 shades oh probably which is probably more than a year's worth of shaving you get more than a year's worth of shaving by going in hensonshaving.com you're being very conservative you can get three years of free shaving uh so yeah head over to heathenshaving.com use the code now you know you'll get 100 free blades for free it's the best shaver you're ever going to have it's i love it i love it so uh definitely go check it out so elon tweeted out dragon separation confirmed the spacecraft will now execute four departure burns to move away from the space station dragon will re-enter the earth's atmosphere and splash down in about 23.5 hours now again the us now has a way to send astronauts to the iss before there was only one way before dragon which was the russian soyuz and i just think we've maybe either didn't know about this because i don't think they teach it in school or we forgot about this but if it weren't for dragon and elon musk specifically in spacex we would probably not have an iss because that means international space station we would probably have a rss or a russian space station i think that this is something that uh you know there are articles that talk specifically about little specifics about oh you know rogozin just said tweeted out this thing and is he threatening elon musk and actually we're gonna talk about that we'll talk about that but i mean there's all these little articles and they'll talk about little tiny little specific things i think that the world has not fully understood that the the space shuttle the thing that you've seen so many freaking times take off and oh my gosh it's the space shuttle that that has not been in operation for a number of years now we have not been able to launch or land it because we have ended that program a dozen years and in the meantime we had no plan the united states had no plan nasa had no plan i mean yeah oh we're gonna have some rocket and it's it was delayed more than a decade isn't it forever and um because boeing and all of these companies want to just oh let's go just keep giving us a check those big checks elon musk is the only reason that the united states can send astronauts to the international space station right now it's the only reason that the international space station is not under russian control right now there would we would have no way of sending anyone to the international space station we would have no way of uh being able to keep the international space station in orbit if the russians decided that they wanted to deorbit it over some city my argument is even if russia wanted to keep it alive and and well they don't have the technology to let's move off of negative stuff let's talk about more positive things elon musk is one of the only reasons why we're going to be getting to the moon in the next few years i think that people we haven't been there since 1974 right and elon musk is going to be the one reason that we get there if you haven't read the book uh liftoff by eric berger or there's many other great books about elon and how he really was super pivotal in making uh these uh to me wildly important companies that have done wildly important things um i would definitely recommend that you check them out because it it's really so important and impactful that we talk about these things and teach it and teach it and understand it and maybe we can stop every time we're talking about inspirational things can we stop showing the space shuttle yeah for the love of goodness i was watching a the other day and they're and talking about space travel the space shuttle was is just made for low earth orbit and so is the dragon capsule although the space shuttle was chosen by president nixon because he didn't understand space and he chose the wrong thing he thought that it was a fun plane yeah he was playing around with on his desk we should have gone we should have gone with the other method and we would probably be on mars now yes all right let's move on this isn't a fun topic but tmz tweeted out it girl model singer songwriter sky ferreira declines date with elon musk after being asked by his team at the 2022 met gala mae musk elon's mom came to his defense and said there was no team i was with elon so no elon said i didn't ask anyone out or request particular seating now he is seated next to her but that doesn't mean that he was asking her out on a date or anything elon went on to say this rumor originated from a parody account but got picked up by real media and twitter trends psy and pope mascanity said this account changed his profile picture from the new york post which they were not allowed to use to pop grave they're using your name to get people interested in their website even the handle is fraudulent new e-post versus new york post the real one twitter should suspend so yep just uh just a bit of rumor that gets picked up well and this is the problem with twitter i mean you're allowed to just choose whatever name you want and then people assume and probably understandably that it was the new york post of course um and there's no check mark thing or yeah it's that's annoying all right so uh millionaire david sachs tweeted out startups with high growth and moderate burn will get funded through the downturn startups with moderate growth and high burn will not get funded through the downturn elon said sage advice in this thread and david knows what he's talking about he started a lot of companies uh and he's a big vc guy so if yeah if you're looking for investment advice that's a pretty good advice elon said if twitter acquisition completes company will be super focused on hardcore software engineering design infosec and server hardware and this was in reference to a fortune.com article about job interest in twitter has skyrocketed more than 250 since elon has said he's going to take it over elon manon say also work ethic expectations would be extreme but much less than i demand of myself which isn't saying much right because look at this tweet from prenay he said honestly the level of context switching that you can achieve and handle is simply astonishing and this is from walter isaacson the author he was obviously hanging out with elon cause he's writing his book about him this is from april 26th late last night after winning his battle for twitter elon was in boca chica and held his regular 10 p.m meeting on raptor engine design where he spent more than an hour working on valve leak solutions no one mentioned twitter he can multitask uh that wasn't a 10 am meeting i know it was a 10 pm meeting that means his employees are working that late yeah and he's working that way yeah lex friedman tweeted out follow your bliss and the universe will open doors for you where there were only walls and that is a quote from joseph campbell the author campbell's work by the way uh he wrote his books in 40s and 50s is credited with influencing star wars and the follow your bliss um mentality elon tweeted it's also how to find secret doors in eldon ring olmar's catalog tweeted out japan's population falls by a record 644 thousand to 125 million in 2021. elon said at risk of stating the obvious unless something changes to cause the birth rate to exceed the death rate japan will eventually cease to exist that would be a great loss for the world and i would just to talk about you know everyone knows that elon tweets about population all the time why do you think so many people are not having more people and i think that's a big question we need to be asking ourselves it's not that we don't kids and we don't little people i think we all do i think it's that there's a few things that go on in your brain when you're about to have a little person you used to be a little person and when i was thinking about maybe having you in my life i thought uh i'm gonna be responsible for a little person and so i have to make sure that i have everything i need to take care of that little person and if you don't if you are worried about where you're gonna live or money or health you're probably gonna put off that decision which is what people are doing and i think we as a society should be talking about that because that means there's a lot of people out there who are afraid right i think that this tweet was um i mean elon has tweeted about uh population decline a lot um especially in the past few years but this one i think because it's uh talking about a specific uh undeniable example it got a lot of uh i would say positive response online i was what i was finding myself uh seeing articles where they were talking about this and it got a discussion going uh to discuss stuff about this now i mean i i don't necessarily think that elon needed to bring it up for it to be such an obvious thing to talk about but he does have a voice and it is um interesting that he can bring uh questions this to a broader audience instead of just people who are gonna i don't know who normally talks about population but i think if you ask a hundred people you'd see that probably the majority of them think that that this isn't a problem they think it's the opposite they think the earth is gonna be overpopulated and we don't even know the science of it that it's not true we're actually going to decline soon but let's move on to esg that's environmental social and governance policy sawyer merit says news tesla urges large funds to stop misleading investors and change their esd valuation of companies and this is because tesla just put out their 2021 impact report and in it they said well elon said yes stop the outrageous false esg assessments where tesla gets a bad grade but an oil company can get a good grade total gaming of the system and hiro mitsunu who is on the board of tesla said sure to be clear tesla's not denouncing esg investments but urges esg rating schemes to fairly evaluate a company's positive impacts as well as negative impacts the current ratings often overweight reduction of negative impacts while neglecting positive impacts nilon said correct and so basically what this is uh a lot of auto companies for instance get to say well we get points because we're making more evs every year well you're making more ev's so that you can keep putting out more gas cars so you should have a lower esg rating than you are getting right and again this is one of those things where it's oh we made a thing and everyone blindly follows that thing and they go esg is the thing that we should follow and then you do just a tiny little bit of research and you're going huh how could shell get this huge oil conglomerate which makes all of their money by selling oil to people so that they can burn it which then definitely pollutes our atmosphere how do how can they have a higher score than tesla you know it's baseball remember when moneyball came out and everyone thought this is the new way to get a best team is to look at all these stats that we weren't looking at before and so for now for a decade that's what they've been doing you still have to win the game right you still have to have players that want to play hard and so instead of looking at that in a player now we just look at oh you got this special stat that looks really good and look at the teams they're building right they don't care about how the teams work well together it's it's just stats and and and little facts and figures and i mean i would even argue that with esg they're not even even close to even that it's it's lies it's just complete bogus nonsense um and i think that it's it's really positive that tesla is pushing the envelope on this let's talk about mother's day mae musk put out this tweet and elon said happy mother's day and this is a picture of elon and his mom way back in the day and some pictures of him recently and i think what what great mother-son relationship i mean i think so much of who elon is is because of his mom dr eli david said elon can you buy the world health organization from bill gates and make it about health and elon left elon tweeted this he said that dmitry rogozin sent this to russian media and i know you probably don't all speak russian so we'll translate it it turns out that the internet terminals of elon musk's starlink satellite company were delivered to the militants of the nazi azkav battalion and the ukrainian marines in the maripool by military helicopters according to our information the delivery of the starlink equipment was carried out by the pentagon elon musk thus is involved in supplying the fascist forces in ukraine with military communications equipment and for this elon you will be held accountable an adult no matter how much you play the fool so that was from dmitry rogozin he is a russian politician who has been the director general of ross cosmos which is russia's uh space agency since 2018. in illinois would say there are no angels in war and eric berger pointed out you got off light elon dimitri accused me of invading afghanistan and iraq and destroying libya and uh eric berger if you're wondering if he's a general or something no he's an author of books about space a good author by the way uh elon went on say starlink has resisted russian cyber war jamming and hacking attempts so far but they're ramping up their efforts and elon pointed to this reuters article where i guess the russians are really trying to hack into that network i wonder why they'd be doing that it's important i think omar's catalog said glad you guys are focused on shipping higher quality updates as you move into a more production-like release cadence existing version already working well but very excited for the next one leak the release notes to us at least okay so there's a bit of a shift we're going from talking about um starlink now we're talking about full self-driving beta uh so tesla's full self-driving software suite that you can kind of get today if you buy a car and spend an extras 12 000 yeah i think so and uh and then be very good a very good driver you have to be an excellent driver and then i'm an excellent driver and then you can get full self-driving beta um and so yeah whole mars catalog is talking about the updates on full self-driving beta and elon said release notes on this version will be long so i don't know if that means that there's going to be more changes or if they're just going to be more verbose on the changes that they're making i don't know we'll see gary said we still on track tomorrow for the release of fsd beta 10.12 and that would have been yesterday so that would be today so that would be tomorrow for you what uh elon said probably this weekend a lot of code updates means much is discovered during testing so this weekend okay shibatoshi nakamoto said if donald trump gets back on twitter this is all that will happen one he won't use it or two he will make a single tweet that is this site is bad come to truth social or whatever it's called it doesn't matter adults don't need to have yet another meltdown helen said exactly then benny johnson said breaking elon musk says he would reverse trump's suspension from twitter and called the band morally wrong and flat out stupid elon said important to listen to my full explanation okay so we don't have time here to play the four minute explanation but we're gonna put a link to the below if you'd to hear elon's full explanation about why he would let trump back on the platform bno news said breaking elon musk says he'd allowed trump to return to twitter says decision to ban it was mortally wrong shibatoshi nakamoto said hello i'm the media here to promote propaganda and try to control people via giving them meltdowns and rage elon says haha so i just want to say that uh you know when we started this elon musk was solely focused on just a couple things making electric cars uh spacex solar panels uh batteries um neural he's focused okay he's focused on kind of a lot of things and uh so we we were all just kind of interested in what he was working on what he's doing now uh i think that some people think that it's a really great idea i think that some people don't want him to do that i think that some people uh kind of me don't really think that this is the right thing for him to be focused on but it's not really anything to do with what this is about um i don't know i'm gonna kind of leave it to you guys if you want us to kind of talk about what we think i don't think it's that valuable to you but if you want us to do that you can leave it down in the comments below i would only really do it on patreon because i would only want to talk to kind of a limited number of people and who wanted to hear what i had to say and it's a very nuanced argument and so it takes a long time to discuss it and we can't do it in two minutes it's very hard also without you being here with us to have a real conversation because i could just keep talking and talking about something and you're shut up i don't want to talk about it whereas if you were sitting next to me i could read from your facial expressions that you're going i have something that i don't agree with and i'd go oh what do you think and then you and then we would have an actual conversation again this isn't really stuff that is pertinent to electric cars sustainability uh the future of uh you know space travel and stuff that so i think we're gonna kind of skip talking about it for now let us know what you think in the comments down below and maybe we'll talk about it on patreon if that's what you want gary brenton tweeted out today elon and i wanted to share a quick message with you on platform regulation and basically elon said great meeting we're very much on the same page you might be asking who breton is he's a french business executive he's also the current commissioner for the internal market of the european union basically the person kind of in charge of i think twitter in europe right because there are laws that were pertained to the internet in different localities um and so uh it's it's a good sign i think that they're having a positive conversation with each other it means that uh you know twitter isn't gonna get banned in the eu at least not yet we'll we'll see who knows pope of muscanity said elon you could create a better platform for less than a billion dollars i've said it before and we'll reiterate it again that being said i kind of understand why you're buying twitter though i don't that you're buying it with tesla money an asset that you said years ago that you'd only sell to fund mars elon said you might be right so that's nice to hear it's nice to hear that he's having uh some second thoughts about it i mean yeah kangaroo says what class build of elden ring are you playing sir appreciate your wisdom struggling with mage funny that you're having trouble with the game and you asked the world's richest person for help to get through the game and it's even weirder that he responds to you not with a shut up get back to work um but with um intelligent slash dexterity build so mostly mage with some weapon skills shield in left hand staff and right with rapier and claws fast switch change armor from heavy to medium for fast roller tank move talismans around a lot many small hits in a row to damage stack is important summon so elon musk richest man in the world and owner of some of the most influential companies in the world is talking about a popular game and his strategy in it and if this doesn't prove my point that twitter allows you to see into elon's true brain sure this is proof it's amazing that he is um taking 10 o'clock meetings talking about uh raptor engine development and then also somehow has time to play elden ring i don't have time i don't to play elden ring most of the time i don't want to really play elders he's not asleep at all i don't it's a this is where i question whether or not he is living in the same reality as we are he maybe there's three of them that's the only way that really makes sense tim urban said and your farthest human relation on earth is your 50th cousin and this is in response to aj pettway's tweet i am a distant cousin to every living thing on earth each blade of grass elephant sea sponge bacterium and mushroom and elon said and we are all descended from a skinny shrew meet your grandparents and so i mean he's right it's a certain point all mammals uh basically seem to have evolved from one particular kind of shrew that doesn't necessarily mean that you're i mean they were related to the mushrooms i suppose tangentially right i mean so it goes back all of our grandparents but if you're talking to the mushroom it's not oh different grandpa i don't know how often you talk to mushrooms but uh i eat them a lot hideo kojima said i was gonna watch a scary movie before i sleep tonight but i better not i'll stick to reading a book and then athena said agreed when passively watching a horror flick i don't get scared at all actively inching forward in a horror game not knowing what's around the corner is scary af the list of horror games i couldn't finish as long a prime example is alien isolation elon added to the list he said dead space 2 fear 2 and bioshock are great history defined tweeted out amazing facade detail of the red fort in agra india elon said it's amazing i visited in 2007 and also saw the taj mahal which truly is a wonder of the world and i just want to point out i think these little tweets are little um things that tell you that he's open to going to india for a next factory or next you know move for tesla so i feel this is his foray into that just a little bit of context with with elon and india obviously there's been um kind of a disagreement that he's had with the indian government where the indian government says uh come to come to india first elon and then we'll talk about you know you building a factory here elon has gone hey why don't you get rid of your arcane laws well arcane laws but also huge tariffs i think it's something 100 200 tariffs um in india for imported vehicles right and then we'll talk and then we'll talk you know i want to make sure that the market works in india before i dedicate a lot of resources to importing things there i think that that is a good strategy i think that the indian government doesn't really care whether or not elon comes in but i think that the indian people they do want tesla to be in there because they do want their cities to be uh have cleaner transportation i think tesla being in india would have one of the biggest impacts on public health of any place on earth i think that you're right elon tweeted out chocolate milk is insanely good just had some and elon i just want to tell you the two reasons why you think that first of all there's sugar in it and the second is it's cow's milk which is basically really close to morphine once it's digested in your stomach so you're feeling morphine and sugar and that's why it's insanely good it's also just cause chocolate looks delicious it is delicious sure but just don't drink too much of it uh anthony said should we deploy chinese elon as a decoy and what we're talking about here is this guy you've probably seen me on the internet he looks a lot elon and elon said i'd to meet this guy if he's real hard to tell with deep fakes these days and i've seen so many videos i feel he is real maybe but you never know i mean you never know anymore with the internet tasmanian tweeted out tesla gigashanghai produced almost 11 000 cars in april working in just one shift after three weeks of downtime ellen said tesla china team is amazing yeah think about that for a second okay the whole factory has to shut down because of covid when you finally do get to open it up it's because most of those people most of those employees came back and lived in the factory i i guess you put bed rolls out for them or cots or something i don't even know how do you put thousands of people to live and work in a factory amazing what your team did there and then was able to still produce cars yep wow and i think it's really important for elon to be creating a positive narrative about the china uh factory i think because of his relationship with china and i know nobody likes china i don't love the chinese government or anything that but it is important for elon in order to have a factory in china which i think is a good thing um i think that it's a very good thing for uh tesla i think it's a very good thing for the world by keeping a positive narrative going about china and and how he is appreciative of the chinese uh team the chinese tesla team he's we we see this a lot where he sends little signals that just say i appreciate you guys very uncomplicated doesn't go into a lot of detail just says appreciated um and i think that that's another thing to pick up you know interestingly also when we're talking about india he's he sends uncomplicated uh positive messages about certain places and i think that that is what um gets a lot of people in those places to say to pressure their politicians to say hey i think that we should let this guy in and they should build a factory no it's a small thing it's not that important but i think it's worth mentioning and that's why we do the show because these little small tweets i mean it's so easy to dismiss them but this is actually telling you where his brain's at and where the future might be at so um that's why we do the show if you love the show hit the button that's what tells youtube to share with other people otherwise no one watches it and we can't keep doing it also if you want to help support us head on over to patreon where we've got a lot of cool perks for you and you can help support the show and get a lot of things that no one else can get see you next time now you know,0
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJmc2lGj1pSF0Joi0WXr5bnX,qRnDhGCYcdA,hey everyone i'm zach and i'm jesse and you're watching elon's tweets of the week on now you know before we begin i just want to thank henson shaving for sponsoring this show if you want to get 100 free blades with your purchase of a handsome shaver you can head over to hensonshaving.com use the code now you know get a hundred free blades that's 200 shaves for free um i absolutely love my handsome shaver yeah i can't speak to it because i don't shave but jesse keeps going on and on about it and so does bobby you've both been using henson shavers and you love them and i wish you'd shut up about it all right so why do we do this show by the way elon's tweets of the week i'll tell you why elon is the richest arguably smartest person in the world yeah throughout history smart people have studied what the smartest people do because that's the only way to gain wisdom and insight the problem has typically been that to study brilliant minds you need to wait until somebody writes a book about that person and then you are number one getting the information late usually by decades and number two you are getting a filtered version of who that person is now with elon every week he gives us direct insights into his mind through his tweets now do they all make sense no some of them are cryptic some of them are misleading and lots of them are downright silly but if you look at them as we do every week patterns emerge and often you are the first to interpret where elon is going sometimes even before he does all right let's get into this so elon tweeted out the extreme antibody reaction from those who fear free speech says it all by free speech i simply mean that which matches the law i am against censorship that goes far beyond the law if people want less free speech they will ask government to pass laws to that effect therefore going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people the far left hates everyone themselves included but i'm no fan of the far right either let's have less hate and more love and then he tweeted out this little diagram showing i guess that he's stayed where he is which looks left of center but the center has changed and so now everyone thinks he's right of center and i think that's a pretty good indication of where people are at with elon they don't fully understand what's going on with this guy he seems to be going far right yeah and i want to take a step back here because i think that everyone sort of is just why is he acting this way well he has been attacked and i hate saying the left and the right i think that that's it's kind of stupid but he has been attacked by people who associate themselves with the left pretty much constantly the the richer he's gotten the more the left seems to hate him even though most i mean most people on the left seemed to to him when he was first starting out tesla everyone was going oh i want to buy that electric car because electric cars are good for the environment you know what i'm getting sick of are the tweets that follow every one of elon's tweets that are somewhere fifth or sixth down there which are put elon if you would just spend some money you could save this problem from happening and just fill in the blanks you know starving children uh fix our water problems fix our highway infrastructure they seem to think that elon because he's now billionaire should fix the problem and i would argue that maybe the government the the government that spends uh trillions of dollars in both administrations in the past uh eight years have spent uh trillions and trillions of dollars on you know i would say keeping the economy afloat and stuff that that's what we have governments for to kind of fix problems i don't see why you if i came to your house one day and i was hey you got a ladder why don't you go fix the uh the school huh that was wrong with you you got a ladder i this is where to me um it is really frustrating when the the left keeps attacking elon and they attack him on the stupidest most bone-headed arguments they're not nuanced they don't unders they don't take the time to understand what who elon is and what he's about or even the truth i mean they say that he didn't pay any taxes and it's dudes he's paid more tax than any individual in american history so this is where i have a lot of sympathy for elon but i also get annoyed when it's i wish that he could kind of tune it out i understand that you absolutely can't though you know part of me wishes oh elon just don't don't let the haters affect you i have a small youtube and the dumb comments that people write in the bug me to no end so having influential people in the world be you on such a jerk because he's rich and he hasn't solved any problems except for uh getting into orbit for a hell of a lot cheaper um from american soil and also uh cleaning up our transportation single-handedly moving the entire auto industry to electrification it's just that must be so infuriating um and i think that that has that you'd kind of want to buy a social media platform yeah well yeah i don't know and uh so that's where i think it's tough for most people because then he will react to the left which pisses off people on the left where they go hey you're attacking this person that i agree with a lot of the things that they have to say usually they have more nuanced things to say but when they attack elon they just go oh it's the easy response oh i just say he's rich and i hate him you know what i would love i would love it if elon would have a podcast with bernie or a podcast with robert reich or see you know some of these people and just sit down for three hours talk it out i know it's time i know he's busy but you know then maybe we'd get some of these things off the table right and and what i think happens is the right takes advantage of this so you know he had an interview with the babylon bee it don't watch it it's the most i mean you can watch it obviously you are a human but it was one of the most creative it was crazy i've ever seen because they don't actually agree on a lot of things it's just they're kind of taking advantage of the fact that he's so mad at the left for being jerks and he kind of wanted to sit at the cool kids table i think right and it was oh i'm getting invited to this very funny satirical thing but they also have a really weird uh he should have signed a contract that said if i after i watch it i'm not gonna let it be aired if i don't it and he shouldn't have it but this is where i do appreciate elon cause he flies by the seat of his pants yep let's get back to some to some tweets yeah elon said coca-cola oh hi lol next i'm buying coca-cola to put the cocaine back in cocaine is a hell of a drug and this is because i think he forgot to put at coca-cola in his original tweet right so coca-cola didn't see it right so he had and he couldn't edit the tweet so he had okay i get it uh real magic is only a sip away actual slogan of coca-cola and you do know that uh at some point back in the past uh coca-cola was made with cocaine which is what made it so popular everything used to have cocaine in it back then which is why the past is so weird that's why they got so much done how did they build the railroads well now let me tell you elon said listen i can't do miracles okay tweeting out now i'm gonna buy mcdonald's and fix all the ice cream machines which is a joke there is a website by the way you can go to uh where you can see all the broken mcflurry machines we'll put the link down below at any given moment and it's usually about 10 of them are broken okay elon said let's make twitter maximum fun twitter dms should have end to end encryption signal so no one can spy on or hack your messages he went on to say for twitter to deserve public trust it must be politically neutral which effectively means upsetting the far right and far left equally truth social is currently beating twitter and tick tock on the apple store and he tweeted out a picture showing just that fact truth social terrible name exists because twitter censored free speech should be called trumpet instead okay uh truth social is trump's version of uh basically twitter it should be set and this is one of those things where you got to be very careful elon when you tweet something this out it can be interpreted as saying that you think that trump's platform is awesome and uh here's the thing right everyone can look at this tweet and go i hate elon everyone can do that why because they can just enter exactly what you're saying they can you can just quickly misinterpret it as being um oh elon supports the thing that i don't i feel elon needs the anger translator from key and peel uh remember that skit they used to do i don't know i'm gonna disagree with you i think it you know what i think that it's great that he's gonna put stuff out there and everyone's gonna misinterpret it because okay it just points to the fact that people need to calm the down a little bit and just take him at his word have a conversation instead of going oh you said x which means y and y means uh z and z means that i hate you mark andreessen said what algorithm could possibly catch this then he tweeted out basically a bunch of crypto stuff yeah somebody had uh made a fake account with his exact name but not the check mark doesn't have the check mark but it has the same picture it has the same name well below the different that is different you got to pay attention to the ad but if you were a mark addressing uh fan and you were whatever he says i totally gotta on this literally whatever he has to say and then he's below get crypto and you're i could get crippled okay but then elon said you know what algorithm could possibly catch this and elon said humans um no a computer algorithm could catch the fact that someone tried to call themselves mark andreessen and wasn't mark andreessen so what well there could be two mark andreessen's but there's a good chance that they would have two different profile pictures and there's a good chance that if they're both humans that both of them wouldn't be promoting crypto scams i kind of think you should take the twitter thumbnail picture and if it's a checkmarked person that you know is that person it should be circled in blue or circled in something so as soon as you see it you're oh it should be an nft so that no one else could possibly use that picture governor mike huckabee who by the way is no longer governor so maybe take that off your damn title i hope elon will insist that all twitter posters use their real names and not be keyboard cowards hiding behind silly little soft mark screen names by the way that's a silly sophomoric screen name because you're no longer governor of arkansas be man enough or woman enough if you even know what that is to stand by what you say if you can't own it don't say it i'm going to agree with mike i could be here okay uh yeah i i am sick and tired of someone writing a crappy little comment in the comment section and you know what comment section whatever it's going to be trash no matter what but sure let's say we're making new twitter um yeah if it's your name and or whatever that's how typically democracy works this course works because you don't put a bag over your head and say i think this thing well and here's nothing if you're an elected official i'm one and i get an email or a letter and it's signed anonymous i throw in the trash you have to tell me who you are that's what gives it credence right um and same thing here but elon said authentication is important but so is anonymity for many a balance must be struck okay hang on sorry elon i don't think you can have both i think again if someone shows up in the public square with the bag over their head everyone kind of goes don't really want to listen to that person right so i don't think there is a balance because you could be acting on be half of the opposition to say so you know and this is where i just i look if you don't have this understood then i don't think you have yourself a good life is free speech what does it support and how is it supposed to be implemented and of course it was implemented over 300 years ago by the founding fathers and if you care about what the founding fathers said then it's very hard to be okay so the founding fathers had horses and they had uh they did have buildings and they had scrolls and they had scrolls of paper that you could carry around and they even had the printing press but you know what they didn't have little computers in your in your pocket right that you could just and then everyone on earth now knows what you just said right they didn't have that right so how would the founding fathers would have done that i don't blue check marks all in favor of right yeah yeah are you really ben franklin i this is the part where it's i think we're there's a such a big disconnect i would love to write a play that is the founding fathers with today's technology all sitting around in philadelphia trying to figure this out going but what about swizza ben i think it'd be hilarious all right so jay kenji tweeted this out this seems to imply that you can't hire outside firms or employees to do things you want them to do without being captured by pmc esg is driven by major shareholders throughout the market pmc are responding to shareholders votes and initiatives mark andreessen then replied to this now take a breath this is complicated okay this is about the market being passive versus active marc andreessen said ah but the shareholders themselves are mainly not applying the pressure rather their managerial agents professional investment managers are see for example larry fink who owns 0.0001 percent of the capital he speaks for larry fink of course being the head of blackrock one of the largest uh fund managers in the world so mark andreessen by the way is the co-founder of netscape among many other things okay so can we can we go back and talk about pmc and esg what are we talking about remember we talked about esg last week that's uh environmental social governance it's a score you kind of get for your company to see how good you are in terms of environmental social goodness and remember that what was it it wasn't shell the oil company had a higher esg score than tesla the electric car company right okay and pmg is the professional managerial class this new status of people in the world that basically just controls a lot of other people's money okay because i'm a person and i don't want to think about investing every day so i say here here larry fink you do the work for me you seem good at it and i want you to be good at esg because i care about that stuff so i want my money to be in good stuff right okay so elon said exactly decisions are being made on behalf of actual shareholders that are contrary to their interests major problem with index passive funds so again you might decide i'm going to invest in the s p 500. you put your money into a fund that does all that for you they invest in those 500 companies and now you really are just a passive investor you're not voting uh they're voting for you and so you've kind of handed over your a lot of your rights as a shareholder peg says deeper problem according to modern portfolio theory the most rational investment strategy is to buy the market but the reason why the market reflects the fundamentals of companies is because arbitragers which are active investors make it so so what happens when everyone is passive elon again said exactly right before he died jack bogle of vanguard fame said index or passive funds were too great a percentage of the market and he really knew what he was talking about there should be a shift back towards active investment passive has gone too far and this is why i love elon's tweets because now we're talking about a very big thing that most people don't think about they think about their own 401k right and they're well i don't know much about money i'll let that 401k manager do it so i'll just put it into here's a bunch of funds great have at it make me some money what you've effectively done make me that seven percent a year but what you've effectively done is you've voted for someone to represent you almost electing a congress person without knowing who that congress person is you don't know anything about larry fink or these fund managers you don't know how they're going to vote they're going to vote your shares so when something comes up about that company you're not in charge right and i mean part of it is because you don't have you've decided that you don't have the time to be able to vote those shares or to to pull your money out of a company if they're doing something that you don't you're just going to go along with esg right good score shell is better than tesla i guess that's what we should invest in captain nemo said don't forget proxy advisory firms iss glass lewis that de facto control the vote of the largest passive investment managers iss's recommendation often the deciding factor in who wins a proxy fight elon said major problem passive index managers should vote in the best interest of shareholders not shift responsibility to proxy advisory firms and then he went on to give some stock advice wow since i've been asked a lot elon says buy stock in several companies that make products and services that you believe in only sell if you think their products and services are trending worse don't panic when the market does this will serve you well in the long term it's not not terrible it's not bad advice at all look this is a problem i wrote about when i was in college all right i wrote a paper to my in my philosophy class about how i thought we could change america if we bought stock and we voted our own shares and my professor gave me a d and then i went and fought it and he still gave me a d because he didn't believe what i was saying but i still believe it i think that if we americans were taught in the fourth grade how to invest money and by the way warren buffett said that this week that you could teach everyone in america what he knows in the fourth grade okay so that's nine year olds you could teach nine year olds how to do what warren buffett does if we did that we'd all grow up buying stock which we're pretty much doing now anyway but just through funding advisors and mutual funds we would then vote our shares we would vote out crappy people we would vote for what we wanted we'd tell companies hey stop making crappy cars make good cars we would do all this and instead what are we doing we're not doing any of it right we're just we're just saying hey we want there to be professional managerial class of people who get to take our money and try and make themselves as much money as they possibly can with it so and they're super powerful by the way people larry fink if he calls you up you're gonna take his call right mark andreessen said i have friends they have acquaintances you have a shadow crew of misfits egging you on elon says my shadow crew is sick also who are they again then he wanted to say sell shadow crew merch to buy twitter all right so a lot of people have been saying this about elon that he's got a bunch of billionaire friends that are kind of maybe guiding him um you know what it's when you have an entourage right you kind of listen to them about what you should wear and what you should you know where should we go clubbing tonight and which companies you should buy for 44 billion right so i mean i do think it sounds kind of true elon's pushing back there and being i don't really have one i don't know mark andreessen went on he quoted lenin here there are decades when nothing happens then there are weeks when decades happen and elon tweeted out i wonder what the world would be if ludendorff hadn't sent lenin a train what we're talking about here is in april of 1917 german general ludendorff took lennon who was in switzerland hiding out at the time put him on a secret train to st petersburg back in russia um and that sparked the bolshevik revolution germany wanted there to be the czars out and they knew that if they could spark a revolution it you know would change things which it did so germany kind of in this case changed history some people believe it would have happened anyway but that's what he's talking about here it just shows you how much history elon knows wow so i mean we're going from talking about politics and twitter to talking about uh shareholder rights to talking about uh elon's shadow crew to talking about history and can i tell you why i don't twitter when you get a tweet this which takes some in you know some brain power read through the threads you'll get a lot of people who just ignore this and go right to crypto and but you know what else you could do elon you could do dogecoin yeah and it's is this really the intelligent uh public square conversation you wanted because in the public square i would be embarrassed if i then responded to this with just a double crypto right and elon said as i was saying and he's tweeted this out before so i don't know why he's doing it again but uh you know the old tiger flick in the balls joke and kimball musk responded to it with the laugh elon said the elusive beauty of imperfection and then is that what the uh those characters mean i think so okay and he's talked about this before that there's a beauty in things not being perfect now if you have been following the whole twitter purchase thing a lot of pushback to elon buying twitter the cnn article came out saying that some of the nation's biggest brands including coca-cola disney and craft are facing calls to boycott twitter if the company's soon-to-be-owner billionaire elon musk rolls back content moderation policies limiting hate speech and election misinformation elon said who funds these organizations that want to control your access to information let's investigate sunlight is the best disinfectant okay so this is kind of a propaganda war going on on both sides some people are very much afraid now that elon is controlling a platform kind of how mark zuckerberg controls a platform or murdock or um right yeah i mean it's so it's not it's not an out of the question uncommon thing no i mean jeff bezos owns the washington post for example right and so it's not uncommon for one man to own a platform it's just that we've all kind of gotten sick about talking about murdoch and we've all kind of gotten sick about talking about you know you just every day are we really do we really want to be talking about mark zuckerberg no you get sick of talking about it and then we move on but now that elon's doing this thing with twitter and it's kind of different he didn't found twitter or something that so this is different so everyone wants to talk about it for now i imagine in a year three weeks okay maybe it'll be out of the news cycle i mean maybe he's gonna he's gonna make a few more waves and then everyone's gonna get used to it and either go back to twitter or they're gonna make schmitter or something else do you remember there's a war going on in ukraine oh right i almost forgot yeah elon then tweeted out ultimately the downfall of the freemasons was giving away their stone cutting services for nothing and what he's referring to here is twitter he said twitter will always be free for casual users but maybe a slight cost for commercial government users and so i think he's trying to justify here that i think he wants to charge a subscription fee for certain users of the platform kind of how on facebook you can get you know you can set up an account for free but if you want to do other things on facebook you got to pay right so i mean it would make sense to me that all businesses would have to pay twitter some amount of money to be on their platform because it's a commercial platform um and i mean i think that today they kind of do but mostly with ads is he going to change the model up a little bit i don't know i mean i don't feel that's a bad idea no i you know look i kind of feel there's two ways to do things right there's the advertising model where it's free but you get stuck with ads or there's the subscription model where you pay for it you don't get the ads i mean i think we'd all prefer if we had the money to pay for things and not have the ads but of course we can't afford every single subscription service we all want that is if you don't have friends and you just borrow their passwords that's the point elon said i don't know seems kind of fungible and i think what he's talking about here is he changed his profile picture on twitter to this um and for those of you who don't know because it's been such a stupid thing um this is those are all uh board apes which are nfts which are non-fungible tokens which are basically just computer code that is non-fungible that has a link to an image in it and the images are of these uh bored apes it was just a big scheme do you remember in 2005 i think it was when those um little bracelets came out that live strong bracelets and it became a thing for i don't know six months a year different colored ones different things and then do you see them anymore no this is nfts it's just a freaking trend you were the same person though who said that pokemon when i was a kid and and pokemon was the biggest thing you were it's just a trend jesse we're not going to buy you any pokemon cards or a game boy with pokemon and i went but all my friends pokemon and you said don't worry jesse in a year or two they will have moved on and then i was in my dorm in college and every dorm was named after some pokemon and so i had to go find my friend in the charizard room and none of them said charizard below it so i did figure out which one it was i got that wrong so yeah yeah yeah yeah i just screwed you up might be wrong about this who knows sport ape nfts might stick around because what an amazing timeless looking piece of of art that is yeah isn't it okay so anyway this was elon's tweets of the week what a just whirlwind of different topics imagine if you tried to predict what he would talk about this week right um that's kind of what a brilliant mind looks yeah he's on a bunch of different things really deep into a bunch of different topics and i think that the problem is for anyone even watching this show is that it's it's such a uh it's a wild ride it's a wild ride and you're gonna get whiplash trying to follow what he's talking about because he's not just saying he's not going from the surface and working his way down he is uh at you know 20 000 leagues under the sea and then he's here and then he's there and then he's over here and everyone's going what is he talking about where what is what is the bolshevik revolution how am i supposed to keep up with all this and look if you watch to the end of the show i'll give you a little hint who he's responding to is a big part of the week you notice that it kind of changes week to week and he talked to mark andreessen a lot this week it's very interesting it is very interesting thank you guys so much for being along for the ride we'll see you next week on tweets of the week now you know,0
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJmc2lGj1pSF0Joi0WXr5bnX,c0a-2zroALI,hey everyone i'm zach and i'm jesse and you're watching elon's tweets of the week on now you know elon's tweets of the week is sponsored by henson shaving thank you henson if you're in the market for a great razor i would definitely recommend hanson shaving and you can get a hundred free blades by using the code now you know at checkout all right well before we get into it i think uh we have to address the elephant in the room which is that elon uh pretty much owns twitter now i mean it's not official but uh yeah he basically bought it at 5420 yeah 420 again you'll see that a lot in this week's show we're going to be going through a lot of the stuff a lot of it unfolds in tweets so it's very meta he's buying twitter on elon's tweets of the week now it's elon's twitter tweets elon's twitter elon's tweets of the week we might have to change the name of the show i'm not sure all right let's get into it all right so sawyer merritt said just wait until starship starts launching elon and eric berger said new quarterly launch report from bryce space tech on q1 2022 here's the chart on up mass by launch provider and as we've seen in the past that white line there is spacex and the closest thing to it is roscosmos and so yes q1 spacex again killed it with their rockets and elon said yeah then remember last week elon talked about the woke mind virus that's making netflix unwatchable and you and i were having some trouble with that because they're what are you talking about elon um he kind of followed up with this he said can they just make sci-fi fantasy at least mostly about sci-fi fantasy and shipitoshi nakamoto said i'm actually quite curious to what you would think of the show devs now have you seen the show devs no i've seen it really good show written by the same guy who wrote ex machina that robot show about the android that's a human i do recommend it so elon asked a question about it he said does it accurately portray software engineers and i was what does that have to do with a show being good or not if i told you about a new show and it had firefighters in it i don't think your first question would be does it accurately portray the firefighting but if i was a firefighter i mean it would real i mean if i was a firefighter and they're okay quick we gotta go take the we're gonna run in there with fire extinguishers and i'd be that's not how you'd put out a fire it would take me out of the experience i see so i can see how elon i mean but that's a very specific point right it's hey that doesn't accurately portray my particular profession right it's yeah and a lot of tvs and movies but it's written by some guy in hollywood so well and the other thing is he's asking for sci-fi fantasy and in sci-fi fantasy you don't stick to what coding can do he's complaining about uh i think picard is that the name of the show i have not heard good things about picard oh the new star trek show yeah i don't think i mean and then why doesn't he say it because that's not on netflix that's on cbs or something isn't it i don't know paramount i've noticed i can't keep up with this stuff it's awful so gary black tweeted out most informative chart in the q1 earnings deck the day after the 2022 super bowl tesla orders surge which validates our long-held view that competitors advertising their new evs helps tesla as evie market leader the most and so you remember we talked about this on test time news this chart shows that um after the super bowl because a lot of other auto companies didn't have their evs actually out yet you heard about all these evs you went to look into them and then you couldn't buy them so you went what can i get and you bought a tesla elon tweeted out one trillion valuation with zero advertising spent right and it's a really interesting point because yeah uh this is something that we've talked about before extensively where we're saying yeah these these uh existing automakers can't win because as soon as they come out with their evs it's completely validating tesla exactly who's been doing it longer so everyone's gonna at first you know in the beginning everyone's going whoa this tesla company i don't know anything about that but then as soon as ford comes out with a ford f-150 electric pickup truck then they're going home it is important it is an important thing and then elon jiu jitsu's them by taking their own power and flipping the you know onto the map exactly true so whole mars catalog tweeted out the q1 2022 operating expenses he's comparing tesla's 1.9 billion spent to rivian's 2.1 billion spend and elon said tesla opex is embarrassingly high in my opinion so i want to point out so you might be asking what is opex it's operating expenditures and that includes r d so research and development and you might be looking at these two and saying so what's the big deal i mean rivian's spending a little bit more than tesla but they're early on whereas tesla's not early on but think about this rivien is spending opex to build out what we know right the r1t the r1s and that van now maybe there's some other r d they're doing on some future products but tesla is spending op x to build out four different lines of cars plus the cyber truck plus the semi plus the roadster plus the tesla bot plus the upcoming robo taxi vehicle plus tesla solar plus tesla energy so all of that for less than what rivian spending and elon still embarrassed yeah i think it was just a veiled insult to rivien um right saying we're spending too much yeah you guys definitely are spending too much vaiphob sacinti says elon musk was not the founder of tesla he acquired it just reminding and willie wu i think had a pretty good response he says semantics he invested in a glorified kit set car manufacturer with unworkable tech he fired the founder before the company died then he changed the business model raised significant money forged new technology and created a whole new industry that is what founders do but this is a long tweet thread because when you get elon started on how tesla was founded he has a lot to say so he said not even close to that it was a shell corp with no employees no ip no designs no prototype literally nothing but a business plan to commercialize ac propulsion's zerocar which was introduced to me by jb strabal not eberhard even the name tesla motors was owned by others remember he had to spend 75 thousand dollars and basically beg for that name he went on say if filing a shell corp constitutes founding a company then i'd be the only founder of paypal since i filed the original incorporation documents for x.com later renamed paypal but that's not what founding means when eberhard was fired unanimously by the board in july of 2007 for damn good reasons no one left with him that says it all they say history is written by the victors but not on wikipedia if the losing party is still alive and has lots of time on their hands so then i think tesla owner silicon valley asked a really good question why do you think so many people don't know the story and elon said eberhard has been relentlessly pushing a false narrative about tesla for 15 years he's a compelling liar fooled me for almost three years bogus thought said in 2008 elon put everything he had into tesla elon said i put in all i had whereas eberhard who was worth over 10 million dollars at the time refused to invest a penny to help tesla if it was really his baby he would never stood by while it starved to death and then he tweeted out the judgment of solomon in wikipedia dima said are you going to write a book about the history of tesla and spacex write the truth and what was happening inside the companies a few years ago elon says i should but that would take a lot of time away from tesla spacex and other work walter isaacson is writing a book by the way walter isaacson being a patreon of ours so walter if you'd want to call us and ask for some quotes of the book you know we're there for you i'm sure he has plenty of sources actual sources but if you can't wait and you want to read a really good book about uh the history of spacex i can i can definitely recommend to you eric berger's liftoff yeah great book really really good book goes over almost everything in such amazing detail um if you read it you're gonna realize how amazing that company is yeah tesla owner silicon valley said would you be willing to sit down with the club and chat more in detail about the specifics of the early days of tesla short and sweet elon said okay sure that's great yeah i mean i feel he's gone over this a lot i feel he really doesn't that eberhard is trying to you know get off on this technicality of whoa but you didn't start the company elon look i think a good telling point about whether eberhardt was the genius behind it or not is to look at what eberhard has done since um you know elon has gone on to do so many amazing things and eberhard is still kind of living in the past and telling but i was a founder of tesla and i mean that's great it looks good on your resume or whatever but it's been a while and i also think that the auto industry and the big oil industry would love to push this narrative that elon isn't the guy you think he is and you know kind of so descent into the ranks of the tesla files i just you know it's it's boring to me i've i've gone through this so many times where i've learned about the history of tesla learned about the history of tesla elon tweets a thing about the history of tesla yeah i get it uh i think it was not a very good business when he acquired it and then he quite literally worked his ass off to get to where they are today and and so you know if someone you know takes you one percent of the way and then wants to take credit for the whole thing where you carried it for the rest of the game i just don't get that right and that fits really well into this next tweet thread gary black tweeted out the financial times op-ed piece where basically they do this thing in the media where they say you know one nice thing tesla had good earnings and then they just kind of insinuate all of these things well they're not going to last because supply problems are going to start to happen and blah blah blah and it's well as elon said the failures are mine the successes belong to others that's the way they keep portraying them it's he didn't do anything right when things are good it's because oh well everyone's buying you views now you know and it's just give him credit right no i mean i've read so many articles and it's any little news story about elon does this or elon does that is headline attention grabbing headline nothing word soup elon did this back five years ago and you're what i don't and then elon did that three years ago and you're i don't care you just scroll scroll scroll scroll scroll and then you get to the part where they're and then elon said this the other day in a tweet here's the tweet well they thanks a lot news they imply that if you invest in tesla you're investing in you know a good company with a crazy leader who could tweet anything out at any time and it's sure he's more open and vocal than other ceos but he's also a very thoughtful person so you're going to get a mix yeah i guess if you want to really just focus on your investment only you wouldn't invest in tesla because you don't want this vocal leader but on the other side of it i mean look at this next tweet shibatoshi says social media is a misery machine and elon said always look on the bright side of life [music] yeah it's a monty python reference yep but this is an interesting tweet though because i mean he just bought twitter and when he was tweeting this out he was in the middle of buying it and twitter is a social media machine and so you know does he want to admit that most social media platforms are kind of based on putting out negative stuff because that seems to be what draws human attention pernae says if elon's twitter bid succeeds he'll focus on solving the real problems make platforms algorithms open source eliminate horrible scam bots edit functionality strict adherence to free speech simpler verification process elon said yes i mean great uh why can't that be done by anybody why does it take a brilliant mind elon to solve the problems that we all kind of know need to happen to twitter to make it a better place i don't know i i don't yeah it gets it's so complicated but yeah omar's catalog says laugh out loud elon made all the banks going in on the twitter bid with him sign their commitment letters on 4 20. elon said that number should probably be on my gravestone at this point and brett winton says it's okay if bill gates is short tesla it only has an average esg rating and is misaligned with climate goals so long as he is long on equivalent amount of shell oil which has a higher esg rated than tesla then there's no hypocrisy at all oh good and so as you're seeing here in yellow those are tesla's esg ratings and then in green here is shell oil's esg rating which is a better rating than teslas what does esg stand for environmental social and governance basically stands for how you can rate your company on all the kind of goals you should have towards the environment and social justice and you know being fairly governed and shell oil company that sells petroleum-based fossil fuel products has a higher esg rating than tesla well it's kind of um well it's kind of that kid in high school who started planning for college on the day one of freshman year and so joined all the clubs and made sure that their grade point average was the highest and on paper they look the best student doesn't necessarily mean they were the best student but they knew how to game the system i see and then he went to harvard business school and then wrote this exactly and then went to work for shell wow yeah how did you know that that kid did that that's amazing uh yeah as elon said esg ratings make no sense shibatoshi tweeted out this joke time spent by a printer actually printing is blue and beep boop is in yellow elon says rage against the machine never specified what type of machine they were furious with but i reckon it was probably a printer and he says also epic printer scene in office space where they uh smash it to bits right yeah why is it that it's 2022 and it still takes printers so long to just print your document because they haven't changed since office space probably before then it's probably the same chip you know yeah oh my god they haven't changed it at all okay so this is kind of a famous tweet now he tweeted moving on this was at 7 46 a.m on april 24th and to put this in context this he tweeted out everyone knew what it meant it meant to the twitter board okay well i'm probably not interested anymore in buying your company this forced twitter over the weekend on a sunday to meet with their board to try and figure out if they had any other offers and if they should take his offer this was basically elon's signal to them where he had checkmated them into a corner and where they would be sued by shareholders for blowing the best deal that they could hope for but then to show you what kind of level elon's moving on psych he says from making fun of gates for shorting tesla while claiming to support climate change action so yes it was aimed at twitter but he's playing this multi-dimensional star trek chess where he's moves ahead and moves above other players so just let's just talk about the twitter acquisition for a minute so why would the twitter board want to take his offer what i don't know i've never understood why they would actually want to even consider it if they knew that they would be losing their jobs or at least all of their pay well you're not supposed to take your jobs into account you're supposed to take shareholders you have a fiduciary duty to the shareholders not yourself so if that's the best offer your company can hope to get you have to take it and they knew that if he backed out share price would drop they'd get sued by shareholders saying hey you had an offer and you didn't take it and now the shares are worth less so we're suing you right and this is because twitter basically doesn't have any more tricks up its sleeve yeah they had no other suitors i mean for instance this is a bad market right now right so it's not even a good market for people to be buying you what other companies would be interested in buying twitter not many facebook google right those are the players none of them had made offers and probably weren't going to make one over the weekend and so this was the best offer they had and they kind of were forced into a corner to take it and so because don't forget he offered 38 above the existing share price when you know from back in january so i mean this was a pretty good offer okay so the board had a fiduciary responsibility to shareholders to get them the most bang for their buck their shareholders and that's how shareholders work and now let's just in an alternate reality let's say that uh twitter was coming out with some new thing twitter two or something amazing and they thought that they were gonna grow exponentially and the the the value of the company was gonna go much higher than 44 billion dollars sure in that scenario they could have rejected the offer um it probably would have been brought to a vote of shareholders and so they might have lost anyway but then they would have had to reveal why they didn't do that right and said we have this new product coming out that we think is even better blah blah blah but i obviously they didn't right they haven't twitter hasn't really changed much right at all no one saw this coming as the big thing because why would you offer that much for twitter for a platform that's pretty much dying i mean it's not it's not growing it doesn't make a lot of money and it doesn't seem to be coming out with any new innovative things it's only meta exactly why can i i can't wait to tweet with in vr wow but it was mainly i think because elon uh really likes the platform it's his big platform sorry merritt said tesla extracts insane amounts of innovation per r d dollar spent here's what some big auto companies spent on r d in 2021 versus tesla and we see that vw leads the pack with 16.9 billion dollars spent in one year on r d wow go down to the bottom there tesla 2.6 billion wow and the second lowest is honda at 6 billion that's crazy because tesla has arguably the most innovative vehicles on the market yeah and elon said strange how these things are bucketed i think of the whole company as being r d and yeah i mean he's given everyone at the company the ability to come up with better ideas on how to improve the product how to manufacture it better whereas at honda or gm those are just very limited pockets of people world of statistics said cities with the worst traffic in the world and elon said tunnels anyone you feel boston should be on that list but i guess we're just not big enough to be on the list no uh in the coming years elon said boring company will attempt to build a working hyperloop from a known physics standpoint this is the fastest possible way of getting from one city center to another for distances less than about 2000 miles starship is faster for longer journeys johnna crider said hyperloop for us then baton rouge is just an hour north of nola and it would be helpful especially during hurricane evacuations elon says underground tunnels are immune to surface weather conditions subways are a good example so wouldn't matter to hyperloop if a hurricane was raging on the surface you wouldn't even notice yeah let's talk about hyperloop for a second because i think um when boring company came out i was kind of thinking it would be a hyperloop play and then we all realized it was more for shorter loops what we're seeing in las vegas exciting to me to hear that he's back on the hyperloop idea because i mean yes there are some companies that are doing that and i'm excited about it but to have elon in there pushing is even more exciting to me yeah i think because he kind of handed it off the torch back in i want to say 2016 2017 um after he did the boring company um and all these other you know hyperloop companies sprung up and nothing happened well not nothing i mean they're testing they make deals and they it takes a while it's big something it's big infrastructure it takes a while and it's true but in that same amount of time they were you know boring companies been working on the las vegas tunnels a couple of other tunnels that they've just been quietly doing i i don't know i uh i'm really excited to hear that he's putting more energy back into hyperloop what i saw with a lot of the other hyperloop companies is they're staying above ground why because going below ground means so much money and i think what elon's signaling here is hey uh going above ground is fine and all that but it means you have to work your hyperloop through existing roads and infrastructures and towns whereas if you go below there's really nothing stopping you right which means a straighter path which means faster speeds which means that you get from a to b a lot quicker and as he's pointing out here a hurricane doesn't affect you right um which think about airplanes um yeah i mean if this could disrupt the airline industry i know it would take a while to dig those tunnels but um if they could be starting to work on that well but here's the thing we spend so much money in the world on stuff right i mean governments just pass spending bills all the time they spend billions of dollars it's kind of questionable whether you even see that money being spent sometimes and what if we decide to spend money on infrastructure this and so billions of dollars were being spent on moving this technology forward it's we could really get somewhere fast it would be exciting let's do it tesla economics said robo taxis will be happening anyone that thinks elon and tesla are lying is living a lie ellen said yep holmar's catalog said the text between saudi pif which is saudi's public investment fund it's a big multi-trillion dollar pile of money and elon musk confirmed that they were serious about taking tesla private noticed that they asked for a saudi factory this was also a term of their deal to take lucid private the fact that they did the deal not just with tesla shows that they were serious elon said the head of saudi pif committed unequivocally to take tesla private with me as witnessed by the tesla cfo and several others that is why i said funding was secured prenate said tesla at the time in 2018 wasn't in a good financial situation and the sec knew that the funding was secured and sec still decided to go ahead with the investigation poop emoji elon said the san francisco office of the sec were shameless puppets of wall street short seller sharks while doing nothing to protect actual shareholders that is why i lost all respect for them and you know i love that elon is fearless here that he can come out and say this so many other ceos who try and be politically correct and not say something to piss off the government because they know they have to work with them elon's telling you the facts as he sees them that is fearlessness and that is another reason why i have mad respect for elon because i mean just think about it we all know what's really going on it's just so few people actually come out and say it and if more people came out and said what was going on then we could stop it from happening so yeah uh elon has bought twitter now so dude do we change the name of the show let me change the name to comment below what what do you think the name should be i think it should be elon's twitter elon's no elon's tweets on elon's twitter tweets of the week doesn't flow well you could abbreviate it into e t e t o w t o w i don't know i don't know put put your comments down below maybe we just keep it at elon's tweets a week he's still tweeting he's still tweeting it's elon's tweets basically elon's tweets will he tweet more will he tweet less right i think he's gonna tweet more right yeah no will there be anyone there to tweet to i mean a lot of people are leaving a lot of people are leaving um he hasn't made any major changes to twitter yet so they're just guessing this is this is the um this is the common thing that we see what do you think is first change is going to be comment that below oh that is interesting yeah i don't know a lot of people are saying that it's going to make uh twitter a toxic uh social media site have they been on twitter i joined twitter and i met i met some very nice wonderful people but the rest of it not really yeah there's there's a lot of crypto bros on there really yeah so i mean in a sense if there was less crypto scams and and that kind of thing i think people are worried that you know it'll just start filling up with uh really toxic people and i don't think um anyone is clear yet on what the rules are gonna be and so yeah i think we just have to wait and see right i mean if he if he makes verification more of a thing because right now the only people with blue check marks are basically people you've heard of in the news um and it's not second don't we have a blue check mark oh yeah we don't have a check mark no we tried for we tried for weeks to get a check mark and uh yeah we couldn't get one no you can't i mean right so isn't that's ridiculous i know we're not the biggest people in the world but we are who we are so why can't we get a check mark and that would be that would be one thing if it's well exactly jesse you're just not big enough but a lot of people who follow us a lot of people who um would want to know that it's us that it's us and that it's not someone trying to scam them because that's a very very common thing where it's hey uh i i gained a lot of money or go to this whatsapp thing scam i mean anyone could just open an account that's now you know and and pretend to be us and then and that's one of the reasons why i don't tweet a lot because i don't want to confuse people and have you know yeah twitter get better at that elon well that's i think that's the whole point that's i think that that's a big reason why he wanted to do it let's see if he does it it might make the platform better uh but it's everything so political that i don't think that people were gonna really see that how's he gonna make money though that's my question right he said that he would be dumping advertising and moving to subscription okay i think i'm not gonna pay i'm not gonna pay for twitter no no siree bob i mean most people borrow their friend's netflix password so right can i borrow your twitter password yeah i uh think you're in trouble there elon if you think you're gonna make money with this i i mean i guess he just really thought that this is gonna i mean this is where i agree with him on one level and i disagree with him on another i feel he's just throwing away 44 billion dollars if you had let's lower it from billions because i don't think we can fathom having 200 billion dollars in a bank account let's say you had two hundred thousand dollars in a bank account okay that's a lot of money okay if you saved up your 200 000 and i said hey do you want to buy this for me for 43 000 one-fifth of what you've got in the bank it would have to be something really worthwhile that you thought would retain its value or go up before you'd want to spend it and i'm just kind of surprised still that he's taking that much of his value and also that is why tesla stock has dropped because so many people are worried that he's going to sell tesla stock to pay for this right and and we don't know how he's going to pay for it so he'll find out you know yeah uh the the part of me that likes you know just to feel safe and to feel ah everything's gonna be fine that part of me is going i don't this but the part of me that's change is good and we need to change stuff up and this is an interesting experiment and this has never been done before that part of me is yeah i want to see what's the spectator side yeah uh yeah or the part of me that's yeah and part of me knows that change has to happen right you can't just lay in bed all day that part of me is okay yeah i get that yeah so let's see what happens guys see how it goes and any time you'll on tweets we're going to be covering it here on tweets of the week just make sure you hit the button so that we can keep bringing in the show we'll see you next week guys now you know,0
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJmc2lGj1pSF0Joi0WXr5bnX,cSBMpeO9Z-A,hey everyone i'm zach and i'm jesse and you're watching elon's tweets of the week on now you know oh you know what um i haven't shaved it let me go shave we have to start the show right now yeah but i um kind of want to you want to shave well yeah i really my handsome shaver oh right yeah but are you doing your henson shaver i it i it i'm sorry um it's it's a i look forward to shaving now it doesn't destroy my face uh and i appreciate that in a razor alone you never liked shaving before well it's because i can put in a new blade every single time and it just works really well so if you want to get your henson shaver and it as much as jesse head on over to hensonshaving.com you'll also get a hundred free blades if you use our code now you know if you're looking for good wallpaper photos check this out spacex tweeted photos from the space station of dragon and ax one astronauts approaching the orbiting laboratory before docking on saturday april 9. look at those beautiful photos so i just what happens is the the dragon comes up in front of the space station which is going 17 000 miles an hour then you're both traveling 17 000 miles an hour around the earth and then you have to kind of slowly back the dragon in it's just amazing that it works this is not going i used to think oh it's just floating no it's traveling so fast and and really the crazy part is that the little things that you do now are going to affect you in 90 minutes wait where am i wait wait a minute wait hang on i know you think it's just oh joystick just back into it no it's so cool when they tried with the gemini program to try and dock they had the worst trouble because they didn't know how to intuitive you go towards it and then why am i going down you're what yeah orbital mechanics super dog get kerbal space program if you want to know anything about what i'm talking about get kerbal space program is the best game ever elon tweeted if the current twitter board takes actions contrary to shareholder interest they would be breaching their fiduciary duty the liability they would thereby assume would be titanic in scale oh elon with the threat so tom mueller who is the ceo and cto of impulse space and he was actually a founding employee at spacex tweeted this elon doesn't want to go to mars he started spacex just to get attention elon doesn't want to reduce carbon emissions he started tesla to get attention and obviously this sarcastic this is from an article by rene des resta who said elon musk is fighting for attention not free speech and he's trying to point out that elon is fighting for free speech elon then of course laughed historically because he wants attention huh tony freeman said do you find yourself imitating or attempting to imitate his leadership style that you experienced at spacex including having your own critical path type interventions or does impulse space in general operate at a different pace that doesn't necessitate that kind of management tom replied elon is the best mentor i ever had so i often think what would elon do when i make a decision but my style is quite a bit different than his elon said thanks for teaching me so much about rocket engines and that's why we're trying to bring context to this because if you don't know who tom is then you're what's he saying i mean tom was really instrumental in getting spacex started and he knew pretty much he was the world's authority on rocket engines at the time and by the way if you haven't seen return to space on netflix we're not being paid to say this or anything i just watched it so good pride the whole time yeah uh such a good yeah you get to see a lot of elon really and a lot of spacex understanding it a lot of doug and bob yeah really cool uh elon tweeted out i love twitter this was back in 2017. how much is it back in 2017 and then just the other day upside down smiley face so he replied to his tweet okay now one thing i hate about twitter is how do you even go back and find these old tweets easily it just seems a giant message board i mean imagine in the old days when on you know you'd have this giant cork board somewhere and they're just message piled over message even elon couldn't answer this during his ted interview about how he would handle certain things editing tweets so i just i feel this isn't a great app for so many reasons well that's why he's gonna make it better zach oh maybe elon tweeted out love me tender which i think had to do with his tender offer for twitter uh and then i love you david sachs who is a fellow billionaire investor entrepreneur friend of elon says if the game is fair elon will buy twitter if the game is rigged there will be some reason why he won't be able to we're about to find out how deep the corruption goes and elon said indeed and so yeah this isn't going to be a simple matter of just making offer get a company uh it's going to be very interesting to see what unfolds sawyer merit tweeted out news tesla has now officially removed the mobile connector as a standard accessory with every new car purchase you can purchase it separately for 400 here and whole march catalog said disappointing move elon elon then tweeted out usage statistics were super low so seemed wasteful on the minor plus side we will be including more plug adapters with the mobile connector kit and then soon after he tweeted based on feedback received we will drop the mobile connector price to 200 and make it easy to order with the car note mobile connector is not needed if you have tesla wall connector or to use superchargers recommend installing tesla wall connector well before a car arrives now we talked about this a little bit on tesla time news i think that it is kind of a mistake it's it's kind of you know oh maybe you just will never need it um but we don't make that argument with airbags and our patreon poll showed that most people do need it so i mean i don't know where he got his data from i mean i know he has data that shows how often you charge that way but i would argue um there are things you don't use that often but when you do need them are important um so a first aid kit exactly right i don't use it every day maybe every three years but when you need it you need it yeah elon tweeted out smooth landing and this was of falcon 9 landing on the drone ship so cool to see over and over again and elon said happy easter and i think that's his dog floky chris anderson from ted tweeted out that they just posted their new 70 minute interview with elon as we said it was good and elon agrees it was good he said i probably should stop cutting my own hair haha trungfang says bring back the double hat look and elon said i feel it's important that one's hat also have a hat long-standing belief james stevenson tweeted out professor scott ice cold takes galloway has weighed in with his opinions that elon musk the world's wealthiest person can't afford this and his company has no ebitda i have attached screenshots of the article along with the graphic illustrating tesla's ebitda below joshua lewis says if you want a good laugh buy his book the four or whatever it's called and read the chapter on why tesla won't become one of the biggest companies in the world james went on to say it shouldn't be possible to be as wrong as he is as often as he is but here we are elon said since he is consistently wrong it should be possible to do quite well simply by doing the opposite of what he recommends and james says looks somebody beat you to it once again proving you can find anything on the internet so this is the axg index performance check this out this is since october 4th of 2019. these are tech companies that the professor has predicted would fail we've got a few tech companies here and of course tesla has very much outperformed yeah and then this is back from uh last november elon had said doing the opposite of whatever that insufferable numbskull says would be a great way to invest he's right it's a new could have literally taken the opposite of that guy's advice and made a crap ton of money [music] gary black says the twitter board interests aren't aligned with twitter shareholders the board serves to represent shareholders if they refuse to act in the best interest of shareholders they should be removed and replaced by new board members who understand their fiduciary obligations chris blake had of course tweeted out that elon is in for a bad time i'm not sure he's prepared to take on a couple phds a few mbas and a baroness who used twitter once a year to reset their passwords and collectively own 77 shares of the company gary black went on to point out let me point out something obvious if elon takes twitter private the twitter board members don't have jobs anymore which pays them 250 to 300 000 per year for what is a nice part-time job that could explain a lot elon said board salary will be zero if my bid succeeds so that's roughly three million dollars a year saved right there so my question is um if you serve on a board usually you get some kind of stipend or pay because it's work uh so he's not gonna pay his board members uh i'm i think what he's saying there is that the board members on twitter currently don't do any work and therefore don't deserve the inflated salaries that they're getting i can't believe they own so few shares that's uh now do the board members decide whether twitter gets bought by elon or is the shareholders um the board has a lot of say as to how it's gonna go about but it's ultimately usually the shareholder okay because it just seems he's basically saying to the board members hey if i if i buy twitter you're gone no of course and it seems the the board members are going hey um legal yeah how can we prevent that's buying that's exactly what they're doing and have been doing mark andreessen says i predict essentially identical censorship de-platforming policies across all layers of the legacy intranet stack client-side and server-side isps cloud platforms cdns payment networks client os's browsers email clients with only rare exceptions the pressure is intense elon said extremely concerning who is pushing this censorship slash d platforming very shadowy what are we talking about here so i mean if you if you found something on the internet that you didn't say you found 4chan.com or something and you were i don't 4chan okay you could go to 4chan and you could say hey this is bad i don't it and they would go go [ __ ] yourself um okay and you'd go oh that didn't work and then you'd go to oh who runs their servers and you'd go to them and you see you'd say 4chan is bad i want them off your platform oh and you could get some traction there it depends on how you do it i don't know what exactly though they're talking about i don't know what the context of this is who who is what d platforming or just in general just any platforming i don't know comment below if you're more of a techie than we are and know about this stuff then elon tweeted out the spacex falcon team making great progress aiming for five-day launch cadence with many performance and refurbishing improvements so basically he wants to be able to launch a falcon every five days the same one that we landed wow just clean it up ship it out that's amazing and this is about the woke mind virus slashdot said netflix shares creator 20 after the company reports it's lost subscribers for the first time in more than 10 years now netflix was thinking they were going to gain over 2 million subscribers this quarter and they just announced that they lost over 200 000. a lot of that was russian uh because over seven hundred thousand russians were forced to not have netflix so let's put that in for some perspective but you know it did crater and elon said the woke mind virus is making netflix unwatchable prenate said woke mind virus is the biggest threat to the civilization neil and said yes and then nietzsche gamer said not just netflix movies in general games tv it's all infested with current year trend woke garbage for fear of offending a green haired freak next to the band button nothing original anymore at all except for media coming out of places japan or korea ironically and elon said true so okay let me just roll this back um i've had netflix for a while um me too a lot of elon's shows that are actually about elon inspiration four and uh return to space those are on netflix and we're made by netflix uh funded netflix's doesn't always have the best content no it's there's a lot of grappling full of just crap from the beginning right because as soon as they started making their own content you know yeah um you know some of the stuff they made was really good but then there's just a lot of stuff to just fill space i would say it's you know one in ten shows is okay so i don't i don't know what we're is again i feel i'm missing context here i i feel this is i came in halfway through a conversation why isn't he referencing what he doesn't because i mean i'll just point out some shows that that elon does the witcher he talks about all the time that's on netflix so right and i mean i know that he liked the game which was originally a book and now they made a show about it and he watched the show and he liked it i don't i mean there's just have always there's always been garbage on netflix right but what is this woke mind virus stuff i don't understand what i don't know can you put some titles down below what we're talking about here because i mean i'd to just check them out and see what we're talking about so i'm on the same page right because i mean i understand good film that's hard to come by right you know anyway thanks so much for watching the show if you want to support the head on over to patreon.com now you know we've got a whole bunch of cool perks there including just for one buck a month you can watch all of our patreon bonus stories it's almost getting a tesla time news every week um and we've got tons of other cool perks there as well and it supports the show and makes it possible for us to bring you this show thank you so much for watching now you know,0
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJmc2lGj1pSF0Joi0WXr5bnX,YW4UzD7KS1M,hey everybody i'm zach and i'm jesse and you are watching elon's tweets of the week oh now you know and you know we're sponsored by our friends over at henson shaving i love my hanson shaver i can't say enough nice things about it and i think that you'd one too you're probably gonna want a heads and shaver it's uh really great just because i mean what makes it so special though so there's this thing that i learned which is that multi-blade cartridge razors um aren't very good for your face because you're hitting it with multiple blades better i thought five blades was better than one it's not it's just you can add a number to it and that sounds great having one blade actually gets you a pretty great shave and the thing is it's not going to irritate your face or wherever you're shaving it's kind of in carpentry i don't have a chisel that has five blades on it right i mean you can always make multiple passes if you need to um but having one blade is really nice so safety razors are are great the problem is they're actually really hard to use um which is why you don't see a lot of people using safety razors and why they're scary the henson razor has very little blade exposed it's way easier than when i was learning to use the safety razor and it's so much nicer you get such a nicer shave just because of the way that they designed it it also you know it cleans nice everything is nice about it and it's made out of just metal and just really well made it's gonna last you a lifetime and if you order it now and use our code now you know at checkout you'll get a hundred free blades so that's over 200 shaves because again they're double-sided razor blades and that is going to last you a very long time and a new box of blades is ten dollars so if you do the math it's 10 cents a shave even if you throw a blade away every time you can get it down to five cents a shade it's very cheap and you're using a fresh blade every time and your face is going to really appreciate it or your legs or whatever you're shaving money saving and sustainable i it all right so teslarati tweeted out that toyota adopts tesla's camera camera only approach to self-driving development and elon went uh it's good to see that they're finally getting it i think also toyota notices that buying lidar is expensive and since you can't make it work with lidar might as well try elon's approach which is a lot cheaper which is cameras are cheap since they waited this long already stock market news tweeted out elon musk today filed for his sale of 371 900 shares of twitter reducing his stake in the company to 9.1 percent from 9.2 percent elon says no sale took place initial share number filed was incorrect okay so he didn't sell no anything and that's why it's so important everyone just thinks that if you tweeted it's the truth it's nice that elon actually went on there and corrected it uh you know the report got filed wrong uh the five biggest shareholders of twitter by the way elon is number one vanguard group morgan stanley blackrock and state street corp kind of sad that the world is now run by corporations it's not even i mean we were all elon boys well none of us are vanguard bought a company you invest some of your your retirement money in vanguard let's say right then they go put money into twitter you don't vote those shares right what elon musk tweeted this out elon sells zip2 to compact for 305 million and then that leads to a bunch of dominoes going to twitter finally gets an edit button at least he has a sense of humor about it netflix knocked it out of the park for return to space with incredible access of nasa and spacex dm2 compelling and beautiful i had the honor of being a part of it alongside elon and all the rest watch now and yeah i've started watching it it really is cool as elon says i'll have to check it out elon tweeted out great work by tesla texas team built and delivered first giga texas production cars and through a killer opening party and if you want to watch our live stream and our recap that's up on our because we did a live stream of the whole event lex friedman said it was fun the size of the factory and the scale of production is surreal congrats tesla owner silicon valley tweeted out that cyber truck looks straight out of a game cgi irl elon said master chief would love it hahaha uh yeah that's my halloween costume for the next 25 years neil dunn said did you build it for military applications are these for platooning and yeah we're wondering about those as well we had all sorts of comments about what they could be uh platooning i didn't think of that though what do you bolt the trucks together or they together trains it turns it into a bridge yeah i don't know i don't know spacex tweeted out falcon 9 launches the first all private human space flight mission to the space station and this was one day after cyber rodeo i know busy guy he's a busy one fella spacex tweeted out the ax-1 on orbit and thomas ribuchin said okay spacex this was one of the best looking booster landings i have ever seen ranking all the way up there with the first ever booster landing the first falcon heavy and the emotional s6 mf landing i attended the two camera shots in lighting was amazing even though i was always excited about utilizing flown spacex boosters on principle and also the impact on mission cost i've changed my opinion about them slightly i now prefer previously used boosters over totally new ones for most science applications and elon said flight proven makes sense renata tweeted out these really interesting charts here she said a spacex launch with a brand new falcon 9 booster is such a rare sight these days so check this out it's hard to understand at first it took me a minute to get my brain around it uh blue is missions so you can see the number of missions is going up but then you see that red which is new boosters is going down so that shows that they're using old boosters over and over again look how many were used just in 2021 wow and then this chart took a few more seconds for my brain to absorb blue numbers in the boxes are the numbers of times a booster stage flew its first second third mission so forth so let's look at 2021 you know two boosters flew their first four flew their second and so forth oh my god so you know out of those 31 missions look how many were repeat and it's gonna just keep growing so each time you reuse that booster you're saving so much money all right world of statistics tweeted out lithium price dollars per ton and let's start in 2012 forty four hundred dollars uh let's go to this year so far ouch wow good news is when the price goes up this lithium mines start coming online crazy so i wouldn't worry too much elon said price of lithium has gone to insane levels tesla might actually have to get into the mining and refining directly at scale unless costs improve there's no shortage of the element itself as lithium is almost everywhere on earth but pace of extraction and refinement is slow pranay said theoretically it would be possible to convert the entire u.s fleet to electric using only the lithium in nevada that's just the single state and elon said true we have some cool ideas for sustainable lithium extraction and refinement all right we'll then put them into let's do it let's do it i guess just do tim urban said wall street journal is the closest thing to a universally trusted news source and it's still not trusted by most americans so let's take a look at this chart here and again hard to read when you first look at it red is republicans blue is democrats so if you average it that's the purple line in the middle so you can see the number one trusted news source the weather the weather uh that's not good uh then pbs and bbc well i mean that's only on average but i mean the the tightest is the wall street journal right that's and and so basically that's why he's saying that um and elon said truth is the first casualty weather is fake i seen the truman show now if you're wondering what he's referring to that's the movie with jim carrey where he lives in a bubble go watch the truman show it's a great great movie siddharth said also must give ratings to new sources based on fake news as a percentage of total news lower the better elon said fake news purveyors would have hysterics but a rating system would improve quality of news greatly and i just want to stop there for a second yes yes a rating system it works for all sorts of things reviews on amazon right uh going on yelp you pick things based on reviews now it's a great system to help us fake yelp is fake i totally agree but so many things that you buy and that you do are based on reviews it helps a lot of times i'm not saying it's perfect but especially if you're getting it from a trusted source if you believe that rotten tomatoes is good you know then it helps you to pick good movies here if you had a trusted source that could tell you this is a better new site than that wouldn't that be great or a better article writer than that one you know it could even go that deep and i think that would be great international space station tweeted out the spacex dragon endeavor with four axiom space astronauts is holding 20 meters away from the station as the station crew works a routing issue this is really cool basically they had to hold in space and they only had i think two hours of propellant so you know you got to get it done because uh unlike what you might be thinking well can't you just sit there all day no you're actually in an orbit around the earth so you have to do a lot of micro maneuvering even if you're just 20 yards away yeah it's really interesting spacex says watch dragon in the axiom space ax1 crew dock with the space station it's really cool to watch so yeah it's around two hours and 45 minutes in you'll you'll see the docking begin elon tweeted out most of these top accounts on twitter tweet rarely and post very little content is twitter dying so let's take a look here uh barack obama has a huge account justin bieber and so forth um elon's number eight at 81 million um but i would argue yeah that a lot of these you know people don't tweet out anything that interesting or they're just kind of self-promoting and i know elon self remotes too but here is a chart of twitter user growth and you can see that yeah i mean it has had an uptick lately but for the most part it was really flat for a few years elon elon went on to say now subtract crypto scam accounts that twitter constantly shows as real people in everyone's feed whole mars catalog said seriously if there's one thing you can help twitter with i hope it's this issue wreaks havoc on the signal to noise ratio of the platform elon said absolutely he agreed then he went on to tweet uh this tweet which was later taken down uh convert twitter san francisco headquarters to homeless shelter since no one shows up anyway and this was a poll and overwhelmingly people said yes um then jeff bezos tweeted out his response which is hard to find now because the tweet was taken down don't know why elon took it down jeff said or do a portion worked out great and makes it easy for employees who want to volunteers this is the mary's place family center in washington it's eight floors 63 000 square feet it serves 200 people per night and has helped over a thousand families so far and this basically what amazon did was they took half the building that was being used by employees since most of them are now remote and they dedicated it to a homeless shelter so it was an amazon headquarters right okay and so yeah i mean i i don't know why elon removed that tweet because i think it's a good idea if no one's showing up to work and you've got the real estate yeah let's convert it to something that people can use well it's a little more complicated than that of course we're gonna talk a little bit more about it uh as as the show progresses uh elon also asked should we delete the w in twitter and i don't know elon he does this a lot where he'll talk about let's start the texas institute of science and technology technology and science right and it's just are you 12 elon really i think that he has this it's a very internety sense of humor i think that i i don't think a lot of people who aren't meme lords elon kind of have this sense of humor which is very juvenile for someone who's on the internet a lot me i mean i get it i'm not but again it's where is it coming from who why is why is the richest man in the world elon musk tweeting this out and i just i don't know what that gains you maybe it shows you who you can't trust or who doesn't have a good sense of humor but i don't think it was that funny to begin with but i don't know i'm i know that there's plenty of people who found it hilarious so mark andreessen said laptop class western upper middle class professionals who work through a screen and are totally abstracted from tangible physical reality and the real world consequences of their opinions and beliefs synonyms professional managerial class orwell's outer party um and elon said disconnected from what it takes to make stuff and i mean this is yeah kind of scary if you think about it because i mean if this is true that we're getting to orwell's outer party if you've read 1984 you know the people who control things but don't really know how the real world works i don't know i don't know these people so i don't know what they do are they actually programming things and they're necessary or are they all just kind of you don't know these people what are you talking about well i don't know too many people in my circle that are these people do you oh and you're in your circle i mean i interact with a lot of these people on a daily basis but yeah you're right we typically tend to deal with people who have you know do physical stuff no i'm not saying labor not saying but who know how to do things it's a really big thing it's a really important point uh to be able to make things with your hands um and i know we're getting all sorts of things i'm not talking just woodworking i'm not just it could be food i mean anything when you make stuff on your hands it connects things in your brain that if you don't do that those connections don't get made and it's this point that elon brings up a lot which is uh he uses make stuff he uh one of i think one of his more famous quotes in in my opinion is um if you don't make any stuff there is no stuff right it's so simple but it is yet so profound um and i think that he really values making stuff he makes a lot of stuff yeah i mean think about it how many people can make stuff at all right it's it's and that's why he was responding to to mark's tweet there it's it's uh i mean and if you think you're making stuff on a laptop you you can i mean we make this show and right now um we're not physically pounding on anything so i get it you can write you can write and there's a lot of physical stuff there's a light for you right but i mean so i'm not putting down the work you can do on a computer it can be very important but i think that if it never comes back to doing something physical right um and then you're never really in touch with you you just think that everything is in response to tweets and stuff i don't know it can't get very dangerous yeah no i think it's a really interesting uh tweet and response from from elon there so this isn't a tweet from elon uh this is a tweet from tank but elon liked this tweet and i think it explains how he feels about twitter a little bit more let me break this down for you elon became the largest shareholder for free speech elon was told to play nice and not speak freely and i guess that's why he uh this explains a little bit more about why he didn't accept the board seat he didn't want to be muffled he didn't want to be told you know what he couldn't couldn't do do so maybe you thought i have a little more freedom if i'm not on the board and that might explain why tweeting kind of stopped for elon after the whole board thing because maybe he's needed time to kind of process and figure out where does he fit in twitter earlier in the week he tweeted out 69.4 20 of statistics are false that's a typical elon tweet and this is interesting early in the week uh people tweeted out that he did the visuals for the side of the gigafactory so he was really excited to do that this is a digital artist um and elon tweeted out the people is double fire and now there's some images of elon one of them is elon's first twitter board meeting and how that could have gone interesting to see that just a gig of berlin elon wants to put you know beautiful art all over gig factory texas i think that's pretty cool hey thank you so much for watching elon's tweets of the week we have no idea what's in store in the weeks to come is elon gonna get less tweety or more tweety now that he's a big shareholder of twitter i have no idea what do you guys think comment down below and thank you so much for joining us we'll see you next week on elon's tweets of the week now you know,0
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJmc2lGj1pSF0Joi0WXr5bnX,SD-zqK47jQs,hey everyone i'm zach and i'm jesse and you're watching elon's tweets of the week on now you know [music] thank you to noon for sponsoring

chicken is an elden ring boss and um laughed at that elden ring is a game it's very popular right now it's uh you fight big scary monsters and they're bosses and you're very easily killed in the game and it's um so it's dungeons and dragons i used to be a big d i don't know if it's it's not really it's not i mean it's that and that the setting could be construed as similar did you used to play dungeons dragons no no played morrowind tesla silicon valley club said hey elon customers for starlink should be able to turn on and off service once the hardware is purchased i had to delay my service and now i can't get back in it says you may be in an area that is at maximum capacity did spacex not provide an unsubscribe warning and he posted the warning tesla silicon valley club said facts i wasn't given warning about the maximum capacity issue i would have loved to have kept paying if needed and not lose my spot elon said we'll take care of it or we'll take of it he's tweeting that fast we'll take of it um so this i mean from from a certain perspective it makes sense that starlink can only do a certain capacity within a certain area because if you have too many starling terminals in one particular area that means that your bandwidth would get slowed down based on so you have to keep paying to hold your place in that spot but i mean maybe it wasn't made clear to people and and so again this is because starlink isn't for people who live in cities no it's for people who live in the places where there is no internet access in the rural areas of the world drive tesla says keep an eye on your safety score as we've heard from a few people that their scores have dropped since some of the early 100 drives are no longer being included in the calculation elon will there be more fsd beta testers added in canada soon elon said yes but we take a very cautious approach to safety as we confirm functionality on canadian roads the beta will expand yeah so it does it is every two weeks moving so if you've got a bunch of hundreds you gotta keep it up yeah elon tweeted out to think i grew up to be business magnet and there's ten-year-old me trying to stick the magnets of the same pole together now this is an april fool's joke on april 1st sawyer merritt posted forbes 2018 article breaking tesla files for bankruptcy after disrupting auto industry posting record margins and a 1900 percent stock return past three years as forbes brilliantly and eloquently stated in 2019 musk is living on borrowed time tesla's business model just doesn't work and by the way that was uh written by jim collins he wrote this article tesla has massively failed as a public company do you want to take that back cleo said i've been thinking about energy use wrong the goal isn't less energy or to just replace fossil fuels the goal is vastly more energy to help more people live better lives and to make it all clean and elon said true and yeah the whole point here is that we put in wind and solar and it's not we have to conserve and shut off all the lights all the time it's that we get to a point where energy is so cheap that we can build anything we want for very little money and if we keep it all clean then we can do whatever we want and here's the the tricky part environmentalism was born before we thought that we could do clean energy and so the best thing that we could do was use conserve and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that you want to conserve energy that is great that is awesome because right now you're doing a heck of a lot of good when the world completely switches to clean renewable energy hopefully fusion and magic that that'll all be great and and here's the thing the reason why we didn't and we haven't dropped fossil fuels immediately as soon as we realized that they were causing damage to our climate is because they provide quality of life for everyone who lives on the planet right and we can't just switch that off and i think that there is a more old school environmentalism idea that gets stuck in people's minds which is that live with less we have to all live with less because we can't do and i think a lot of people thought that about electric cars they thought well that means i'm living with less and when tesla showed you the opposite it's you get more and that's why certain environmentalists are people who have that mindset of i need to live with less i need to sacrifice they're stuck on the prius do the right thing yeah it's the prius or it's the leaf okay i am making a sacrifice it's a large sacrifice it costs a lot of money and it isn't as good as a normal car and you don't need to sacrifice tesla is saying and elon is saying no it's that we need to do everything the right way and then we can make life better for everyone we don't need to live with less up for debate but it is an interesting argument all right i think i could watch this over and over again and we've shown you this on patreon bonus stories um now we're showing this to you on tweets of the week if you haven't seen it worth watching um and i mean as you're seeing here this is mesmerizing to watch to get this close to machines that we've never gotten this close to to get under them as they're about to stamp down on you as the gigapress is you know about to press something and you're getting closer than you can with a human because it's just a drone oh my gosh this is so fascinating and it's so amazing to see the transformation i mean if you compare this to fremont factory just a few years ago this is just talk about the machine that makes the machine yeah and i mean they're able to make this car you can see the pieces that they're putting together big humongous gigacast one side of the car big stamped thing oh weld them together there's your car body yeah whoa yeah that's amazing stuff i hope the people at ford and gm are studying this also did you notice did you see you see the car that was covered in the beginning you see that what what no i didn't see it okay but hang on you mean the car outside the factory uh-huh well that could have just been a model y covered you know because they had a thing they were fixing or something maybe maybe but maybe some you know a little hint a little okay a little easter egg it could be thank you i think could be something comment below i don't think it's anything but you never know so brett winton from arkhanvest uh was having a conversation with his mom this is how it went mom they even have bitcoin miners in shipping containers so it can drop into any remote location with excess energy well do the miners mind the the the miners mom they're computers oh after i thought i had successfully explained the whole system elon said just show her this explains everything and of course this is a dogecoin which doesn't explain anything but it's pretty funny doge to the moon is joking yes it's a joke sorry merit said breaking tesla delivered an all-time high of 310 000 vehicles in q1 beating wall street expectations of 309 000 total q1 production was 305 000 congratulations and we covered this in tesla time news and then of course elon tweeted out a spoiler new boba fett trailer that's pretty funny that's a good it's pretty good design elon tweeted out humanity did not evolve to mourn the unborn but we should i'm talking about not having kids in the first place that's the problem and they tweeted out the scientific american article from 2021 talking about the pandemic caused a baby bust not a boom as people were afraid to have kids not knowing what the world to look and they stopped having kids so again elon is very worried about our population having a problem lex friedman said a moment of silence for the 500 billion sperm cells produced by an average human male in one lifetime each genetically unique elon said seriously one of them might have been einstein that's true it's an interesting it's i think there's a monty python song about that oh we're back with the latest tweets all right so uh elon tweeted out berlin rocks and yes it does no one's gonna argue that point and then this tweet oh hi lol i think is because as we mentioned on the main show elon just bought a almost 10 interest in twitter about 3 billion got him what appears to be a board seat and i think this is him saying hello to the new company that he's now running well so this brings up a question so people don't fully really this doesn't happen very often where you know publicly uh one person buys 10 of a company it becomes the you know the largest shareholder right of a company quickly gets a board seat and then i mean this is bigger than jack dorsey who was the co-founder right it's almost elon just became a co-founder yes well but no but i mean it is weird that jack dorsey who co-founded twitter had such a small stake in his company i mean he didn't exit as ceo of jack dorsey did of twitter um but yeah so now elon's the biggest shareholder and gets a board seat so he kind of gets to run the show no one's used to this no i mean it shows that he's gonna have a really active role i think in the company i mean don't you think that he does elon kind of has a lot of other stuff on his plate not too much no i mean um i'm trying to think of what else he does uh i don't know uh spacex tesla right that's easy cars and rockets um two of the easiest tunnels brains right um i i don't know i think he's probably getting bored with the other things elon what's going on come on you have other stuff to focus on let's get us to mars and let's get robo taxi going and oh of the robots here's i mean i think that he is worried about this is kind of where he's worried about ai um he has been so worried about ai and everyone's just thinking terminator terminator uh irobot you know just humanoid robots walking around punching people shooting them with arm guidance and stuff i get that but here's the problem remember what he did when he was worried about ai he started open ai sure and where is that today it's a private company that's making ai that no one has any control over right so i all for what elon's focusing on yes uh you know having a platform where people can speak openly and freely is great but if you don't stay focused on it and your attention gets drawn elsewhere then i mean you can only do so much and i'm just worried that he's gonna lose interest or i feel he's going to come in fix twitter uh by which i mean changing the algorithm changing the algorithm we're tweaking algorithms so that they're no longer as bubble making things but then the problem is is twitter going to fail because people twitter because they're i'm in my bubble yeah i mean here's here's the big problem um you can't change people so and twitter's a company or psychology and twitter is a company that needs to make money if it wants to stay in business so if you don't follow what people want and you just give them what they should have that's called government well yes and and also maybe no i mean because you know we just kind of it was you know everyone was kind of living their lives or whatever then it was boom social media social networks you know and you're over connected and people who are you know oh so my space no it was not my space my space was yeah just the incubator proto genesis for uh what became you know facebook and twitter and stuff that and so facebook and twitter are the first generation i'll call you know you could technically say but the first real generation there's three billion people on facebook yeah um and twitter is 200 million active users right you know um but there are more people who i'm not an active user on twitter because i hate it um but i don't know i think that this is our first learning of about social networks and you tune an algorithm to be let's get more engagement and it just ratchets up how can we get people engaged and that doesn't make for a very healthy platform right as anyone who has what i'm saying is as he changes that you might just kill the platform right because it would just go to the worst platform the platform that's going to kind of exploit the the psychology of people's brains more right but i don't know i don't know i mean maybe people can kind of get past that and look past that and go no twitter is helping me have you been on twitter most people who cannot get no that's why you hate jesse no it's it's absolutely true all right so what is this uh do you want an edit button yes and then the uh the two there's a poll and the two responses that you could do were you see or on um so of course he's making the joke that you can't edit anything when you write a tweet there's no way for you to go back and edit your tweet you can delete your tweet and then everyone sees that you deleted your tweet when they try and read your tweet unless someone has screenshotted your tweet so this we think is uh after you screwed something up you could go back and fix your typo right um but i have a question what if you um edited it for the meaning and a bunch of people had already tweeted after you but then you edited your tweets so now it completely changed the meaning and then people are responding to a different meaning so right um but there's been a lot of discussion this this by the way i don't think really means anything i mean it well it kind of shows that elon is is saying i'm gonna say i'm in control of twitter now um twitter had already posted a tweet twitter tweeted a tweet on twitter you following me yes tweeter twitter twitter had tweeted a tweet on twitter about twitter but this is when it was first it was an april fool's day joke saying do you want an edit button because it was a joke because apparently but this is april 4th so it's not a joke so elon's not joking do you want an edit button elon often screws up um a word or two misses a word oh i mean everyone does on twitter all the time because they're typing on their phones in the bathroom they don't they don't pre-read it or anything right and no one can look at it because it's twitter and right one of the reasons i hate twitter and then they post it and then you have this this dumb glaring error in your tweet the idea i think behind a edit message is that it would say that it's been edited maybe you can view the original and then you can only have a certain amount of time before you can edit your tweet i don't really care um to me i don't it doesn't most people want it though most people want it 73 as of us reading it now want it some people don't a lot of comments about just oh but they're gonna people are gonna lie and people are gonna imagine if you could edit stuff on youtube after you put it up i mean you can kind of but not really not really i mean and it's the same kind of idea i guess is that the people who commented on this particular thing throughout history could you edit stuff i mean you ride through the square and go the british are coming i'm sorry i meant i'm i meant not the regulars that's what i actually meant to say um well once it's out that's why you have editorials and newspapers and stuff that because they and retractions retractions i'm sorry right so maybe they should have retractions it's so complicated it's the law of unintended consequences though i think uh who knows i don't know so but anyway this is showing that elon is saying i'm in charge of twitter now you go through me to tell me what you want twitter to do um just with tesla yeah it doesn't always work out do you control frequently elon showing a city i don't think so i don't think so because he does tend to put people in charge of certain aspects of the business until he hears something is going on then he usually comes in and fixes it and changes i don't know i don't know what do you guys think button i don't care i i mean i don't it's not that i don't care what you think it's that there's the poll right weird yeah twitter uh and then elon retweeted a spacex tweets falcon 9 and dragon vertical at 39a targeting friday april 8th for the launch of ax1 all right so ax1 is what is that again it's a private mission to the international space station so it's not a nasa mission it's carrying uh cargo it's carrying astronauts oh um we mean privately carrying astronauts so it's not nasa wait so there is a nasa astronaut with three civilians right a former nasa astronaut oh wow not nasa now this is such a change i mean lately if you look at launches it's almost all civilians right and i mean it used to be not this way used to be only governments flying into space just in general you know by which we mean the shuttle which was nasa or the soyuz which was russia now you know there was a soyuz launch to the iss during the ukraine uh russian conflict whoa remember that um and now this is a private mission so this is uh you know spacex although it's it's being funded by a different company axiom wow that's cool but they're paying spacex to fly them to the international space station and then lastly massimo tweeted out this uh the amount of energy used by all humans and industries annually which is about 5.6 times 10 to the 20 joules or 567 exojoules is equivalent to the amount of solar energy that strikes the earth in the span of only 90 minutes okay so that little blue dot at the top that's annual global energy consumption by humans and the big orange box at the bottom that's how much energy the sun produces on earth in just 90 minutes so for all those people who are solar panels are dumb they don't really work as elon says the power used by humans is so tiny compared to how much power from the sun reaches earth solar power is about one gigawatt per square kilometer a current solar efficiency net electrical power is about 200 megawatts per square kilometer the entire united states can be powered by a small corner of texas so if yeah if we were to take this seriously and and build let's just do it why are we waiting we have the answer everyone knows this is the answer i mean it's of course more complicated than that but uh i'm sorry digging oil out of the ground or coal out of mountains is more complicated and awful than that so let's just do it we're also flying rockets right now that re-land themselves we can do complicated things and i mean this isn't a new thing i mean when when we kind of came up with type one and type two civilizations by the way we're a type zero civilization yeah a point four i believe it's type one civilization is one that can use all of the solar energy that hits its surface if i ran for president by the way that would be my platform we're gonna get you to a type one at the end of my term we will be at a type one planet i mean we don't need to be building a dyson sphere quite yet but that can be your term again it's so many we're so far away from say a dyson sphere but just building little bits you know if you look at the earth and it's just oh it'll be that little dot that's all the solar energy that we need yeah to power our entire civilization by the way a lot of people think you have to build it right there in texas no he was just giving that as a point we would spread this over the earth and guess what the sun's always out somewhere on earth yes and you can build batteries to store it at night and everything that it just you know would add stability to grids and i think i think we all kind of understand that that's the point well congratulations to elon for getting on the board at twitter i'm gonna save up my money so i can start getting on the boards of companies uh um it's show it's kind of i don't know it's it's so interesting it shows how you know capitalism is supposed to work um it's so funny to see how elon does it more in the right way than any other company and then everyone who complains about capitalism and he puts his money so he puts his money where his mouth is i mean that was three billion dollars how many of you wake up one day and take a huge chunk of your net worth and write a check to something that really matters to you that i mean good for him right and i mean he he can make much more of a difference than say if i had the commensurate amount of my net worth you know i'm gonna buy five grand of twitter you know that doesn't they're not gonna listen to me or give me a board seat um some of the board didn't even uh write to them in fact one of the board members of twitter doesn't even have a twitter account as far as i've read never tweets how can you be on the board of something there's a friend cat i got my cigar and i don't i use email i don't i don't use it i don't even know what this platform is so anyway thank you so much for joining us on elon's tweets of the week um i guess pretty soon it's going to be elon twitter elon's twitter tweets of the week yeah so we'll see how that goes what interesting how we start tweets of the week weird and elon see follow us all right see you guys next week,0
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJmc2lGj1pSF0Joi0WXr5bnX,e-Q0iVk6WP8,everybody i'm zach and i'm jesse and you're watching elon's tweets of the week on now you know we want to thank surfsharkvpn for sponsoring this if you're not using a vpn you might want to reconsider yeah for the longest time i knew how important my computer security and privacy was but i thought that using a vpn was going to be expensive

out the link is in the description below all right let's learn about some physics jesse okay massimo says if our planet was 50 percent larger in diameter we would not be able to venture into space at least using rockets elon said true and even a 10 reduction in g would make reaching orbit relatively easy he's talking about gravity um so wait so if we were too much bigger we couldn't even use rockets to get off the planet if we were too small you just i could throw you off the planet isn't that weird that we're in the sweet spot not really a sweet spot we're on the very edge of not being able to leave this planet so let me let me just ask you so if if our planet was a little bit more dense or bigger or whatever um does that mean we could never get off it it would be really really really hard right now it's only really really hard it would be exceptionally harder but do you mean we just have to build a really big rocket to the point where materials start to fail at those scales so i just have a question what if there's another civilized society somewhere and we've been saying all these years why haven't they come to visit us and it's because we want to visit but we can't get off our planet could that be true it could be but i mean if you want to really follow the fermi paradox all the way down there would also be probably civilizations on smaller planets who were they weren't able to jump into space but you know because you know taking off from the moon really easy i mean they probably hit golf balls into orbit around the moon right not hard to actually do especially with no atmosphere we actually talked about this if you did hit a golf ball on the moon you could technically put it into orbit and then it could come back around wacky in the head couldn't it uh it could tim urban said i'm in an ongoing relationship with a moody sensitive grudge holding and generally crazy girlfriend called the twitter algorithm everything will be going fine and then suddenly i'm getting the cold shoulder and i don't even really know what i did and just have to wait it out i'm worried about de facto bias in the twitter algorithm having a major effect on public discourse how do we know what's really happening shibatoshi nakamoto said yeah essentially all the social media companies and search companies have the power to greatly alter public discourse with their algorithms i'm also fairly certain that no one who works there would actually be able to tell you how the algorithms work elon said the algorithm needs to be open sourced so elon continued by putting out a poll he said free speech is essential to a functioning democracy do you believe twitter rigorously adheres to this principle the consequences of this poll will be important vote carefully and so over 70 percent of people said no lex friedman said yes for bots elon said especially crypto spam then i think jerry rig everything brought up a good point he said free speech protects citizens from their government not meme lords from private companies and i do think this is a good point which is that i think elon is saying that twitter is basically our town square now and i kind of want to push back on that a little bit i think for a lot of people it is a town square but there are many town squares there always have been so if you lived in a little village let's say back in the 1600s and you had a town square yes you could go to the town square maybe put up a you know a flyer about something you felt about or you know talk out to your fellow citizens but there were also other places in town that you could talk and i think elon is equating twitter with the only place that you can talk so he said given that twitter serves as the de facto public town square failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy what should be done is a new platform needed so i want to point out that yes there's 206 million daily active users on twitter that sounds a lot but let's put that in perspective facebook has 2.9 billion daily users this is where to me i think you know according to the letter of the law now elon is wrong according to the law right this is a private company and they're allowed to do whatever they want with their network within the laws which and they are doing that what elon i think is saying here is that the laws have not been keeping up with uh the world and people people can adapt very quickly what laws are that do you think there should be laws applying to twitter it starts to beg the question i know that 206 million daily active users is not uh that many it is glo we're talking globally we're not just talking about the united states facebook obviously has uh you know an order of magnitude more than that um i would just argue though this isn't the only place to speak so if you don't what you're seeing or hearing in twitter you don't their algorithm or whatever you can go somewhere else it's not that you don't something it's that twitter is censoring people which is what he is having problems with he is going down to free speech close to well a fundamental i think we should divide it out it's you still have free speech the constitution protects twitter to do what they want to do protects you to do what you want to do you may not twitter's algorithm you may not what they're doing you are free to leave right and so i would recommend just with any newspaper or tv show you don't you leave and you go somewhere else it is a question of what is the town square anymore if you go down to the town square are you just going to be yelling at traffic it's great that that's protected but is that useful and so that is the discussion that elon is i just think he should have here well i just think he should talk about it that way i mean he's talking about it as if it's free speech that is not the issue in my opinion he's talking about that he doesn't the algorithm and that's fine maybe you want to talk to twitter and tweak it some people on twitter were hey elon join the twitter board and do something about it true i mean again we run into this problem where twitter is a private company right and they have their own protections under the law right again we could be talking about changing the law i'm not opposed to changing the law it is just a question yes but is it twitter that needs to change or is it all okay but here's my question i don't think it's as easy as you think to change the law or to change even twitter's algorithm if you change it so that you it then maybe i won't it the problem is it's a very big platform and there's some fundamentally wrong things with it i will just say when you and i are talking you know who i am when we're talking on twitter you don't necessarily know who i am and that isn't really a fault with the algorithm that's just a fault within the exact way that we set up social media we set up social media i mean have we all seen the social network before is mark zuckerberg the social kind of guy that you want to be setting up a social network because he set up the you know it wasn't myspace but he set up the first social network twitter then came after that and was heavily affected by it and so you could create an account and you put shabatoshi nakamoto on there and the picture of a dog and we don't know who the heck that is exactly i mean inherently one problem here is we know that elon musk is elon musk but many other people it may be good that they want to maintain their privacy but it's hard to talk to someone who's got a bag over their head and is you don't know who you're talking to and that eliminates the town square part of the argument for me right where it's yeah if i'm if if i can go to the town square with a mask a super good mask on my face and you have no idea you can't watch me go home or anything you can't have a discussion with me i can i can just go shut the heck up i'm not shut up go away i am i listen to what i am saying i might be a bot for all you know you know in in town meetings across america when you get up to speak you say your name and where you live and that lets your other community members know oh that's zach um when you don't do that i know it's nice oh you got your privacy but that means that it's hard to take what you say because i don't know where it's coming from i don't know who you are i can't go look up your other you know i can't go find out more about you very easily so it's a big discussion i'm not saying that i know all the answers i'm i i don't think that you're saying that you know all the answers nope and i think what we're saying is we don't know if elon has all the answers here it twitter is not the right platform to have this kind of discussion i feel in a hour long uh podcast with someone who's gonna you know have some looking at you joe rogan that you know that would be hey oh let me consider this point let me consider every point under the sun that would be a fairly helpful thing in order to get to the bottom of where we're going to be thinking about this well and elon is going to talk about a new social media platform in a second but first he says love nasa this is in response to nasa tweeting out artemis three astronauts will touch down on the moon aboard a spacex starship human landing system i mean is this not cool or what i know i am so looking forward to this this is gonna really i think a lot of us don't know that this is coming or haven't really gotten the news or even think it's true um because some people don't even think we landed on the moon but we are going to land on the moon again it's been decades and decades for a lot of us watching it hasn't even happened in your lifetime and so i think to have this happen again in even a bigger way is going to be just so exciting then elon tweeted out the movie gaslight has gaslit so many people it's insane so i looked it up and i'm really confused there's a 1940s movie called gaslight but then a lot of people say it's fake and that it's not really a movie and i just don't even know if i want to go down that road i don't know um yeah it's something that i think when you're when you're on twitter sometimes there's stuff that you don't have time for okay and this is probably one this is one of those things where i'm gonna i'm gonna put down my wall and i'm gonna say you know what i don't have time for this i have to write the news this week right i have other stuff going on in my life i'm gonna i'm gonna just that's what he said i don't know you can check it out if you want to uh we're gonna move on elon tweeted out old but good and then he put up this meme fbi i see you crying through your front camera but i don't even blame you i'm crying too and this is uh from lord of the rings right that's frodo uh and it says sam it's in the great stories mr frodo the ones that really mattered full of darkness and danger they were those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something even if you were too small to understand why but i think mr frodo i do understand there's something good in this world mr frodo and it's worth fighting for and that's from the two towers don't know exactly what the reference is at the moment it does take a lot to unpack um again i have learned something that we're going to talk about later in this episode that you know elon compartmentalizes what he does so when he's in twitter mode he's in twitter mode and that's why i think it's so valuable you get to see where his mind is at at that time dreams of mars tweeted out the international community you always hear about and elon left world of statistics said 0.3 percent of solar energy from the sahara is enough to power the whole of europe and elon said easily and that's what it would look that little dot dreams of mars also said it's also not a question of money global need currently is about 51 billion solar panels or about 10 cents a watt for a 350 watt panel equals 1.8 trillion us dollars less than biden's last infrastructure package surely on such a scale the price per watt would come down a lot and i think that's a really good point this is actually an achievable thing kind of crazy to think about i know a lot of people could do happen but it could and then we could be completely independent of fossil fuels for most of our energy needs now i know there's still probably airplanes and stuff that would need those but for a lot of our energy we could get it from the sun why don't we go towards that more god frederick said momentum and mistakes a quote from elon here if you can't tell me the four ways you picked something up you probably weren't the person who worked on it musk and other senior leaders tolerated failures as a side effect of iteration i remember once elon saying one thing which was if you can't tell me the four ways you picked something up before you got it right you probably weren't the person who worked on it giacomo digregoli recalled musk echoed the sentiment if there were two paths that we had to choose one thing or the other and one wasn't obviously better than the other explained in this 2003 public talk at stanford then rather than spend a lot of time trying to figure out which one was slightly better we would just pick one and do it and sometimes we'd be wrong but oftentimes it's better to just pick a path and do it rather than just vacillate endlessly on the choice i think there's something very special about the all-nighter ethic there's definitely something about the nocturnal lifestyle for engineers specifically that really opens up the chakras of creativity or code writing people get slightly sillier but also maybe a little more creative they get tired and some spirit and camaraderie wakes up in those hours and you get more done because you're not afraid to tell people to shove it when they're doing something wrong and the interactions become more interesting but i also think there's this massive value that you harness when you're doing an all-nighter when you've gone for presumably seven or eight hours of work and you're really getting up to a point when something's about to be born and then you go for eight more hours and instead of stopping to go to sleep and letting those ideas dissipate you actually focus on the findings you've made in the last few hours and you just go crazy and do some more of that the tone was set from the top engineer william wu remembered that musk expected employees who work late on a friday night to return by saturday morning later wu purchased shares early in tesla just after its ipo based on this experience workaholism does no good for me as an employee but then i feel if elon does that at tesla then tesla's going to succeed no matter what it's painful to work for him as an employee but as an investor in his company it's a wise decision okay here's some of the wisdom you get out of tweets that can be hard to find and that's what i think we bring value to is it take some deep diving into these threads to find these tweets but elon did respond to this tweet which means it's not just out of left field this is how he works and so yes i can't imagine working for the guy i'm sure that it's incredibly hard and why so many people work only in their 20s and then leave but on the other hand yeah as an investor why wouldn't you yeah tim urban tweeted out this is my favorite episode of bad lip reading yet and corn pop was a bad dude and he ran a bunch of bad boys and i did yeah he and back in those days the shot things have changed one of the things you had to use if you use pomade in your hair you had to wear a bathing cap and so he was up on the board one listen to me i said hey esther you off the board i'll come up and drag you off well he came off and he said i'll meet you outside my car this was mostly these were all public housing behind it my car there was a gate out here i parked my car outside the gate and i he said i'll be waiting for you who's waiting for three guys in straight razors not a joke shibatoshi nakamoto said wait wait i can't even tell if this is real what is going on elon sighed and tim urban said it's real so yeah i thought this was fake it didn't sound he's just speaking gibberish we have to understand that it is taken out of context that there was a beginning of this uh that could maybe sound a little bit less disjointed because just for those who are wondering bad lip reading is a youtube that can make it sound people are saying things that they're not because they replace words but it looks your word is you know bad liberty by liberating and so a lot of times it'll just be gibberish and if this does sound gibberish but it looks a bad lip reading it's you know the elon doesn't president biden um yeah and understandably understandably especially because uh if you if you view it through the lens that elon views it which is that uh biden appears to be bought out by unions right to do their bidding uh instead of standing up for actual principles when it comes to electrification right then uh which is an important issue he is having fun to you know poking fun at biden again the clip is taken out of context but it's used a lot to uh attack biden for you know being this person who can't put together a sentence and it doesn't seem to make any sense i i think if you were to put it into context it would make a little bit more sense i do think that it is kind of a wild thing to have recorded um but such as uh the world that we live in in the year 2022. slashdot said russia launched ukraine invasion with hack of thousands of satellite modems and elon responded starlink at least so far has resisted all hacking and jamming attempts first of all that's impressive i mean because you know i'm sure russia is putting their top hacker people on this and to not be able to hack it shows you a lot about how great their software is yeah i'm really interested in the months and years to come into learning about how they were able to prevent the jamming uh from occurring because that's amazing eva fox said prices on used teslas jumped six percent in the last two weeks to sixty five thousand dollars and elon said as predicted so i mean yeah i get it um there's been a delay in when you can get your car the prices have gone up so even if you have a tesla right now it's worth more and elon said as predicted though so that means he knew because of all this that was gonna happen and he's talked about it i mean if inflation goes up then the price of everything goes up it doesn't mean that your used car is worth less okay now this is a long thread and normally uh if we're doing tweets of the week we would have had to have cut it because it takes time i actually think these next 10 or 11 uh thread thoughts not only these principles that elon has run his life by but i think that we could all benefit from some of this wisdom so we're going to read them i think you might actually want to come back to this if you're wanting to be more effective in life because i i'm going to so abhishek said elon get done in 2021 alone he doubled his net worth to 271 billion and became the world's richest man here are 10 tips from musk to get more done and do it faster stay optimistic musk once said i'd rather be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and right being optimistic can help you remain persistent motivate your team enjoy what you're doing note to self optimists will win set stretch goals stretch goals are targets that sound impossible at first whatever you think is realistic double it the pressure to push beyond helps you build the necessary skills to get there share your goals when you share your ambitions everyone feels they've got skin in the game your colleagues will work harder your family will support you better your audience will keep you dependable batch your tasks unlike multitasking you don't switch between tasks and lose your flow instead you do the tasks that demand a similar mindset together example musk processes all communications email and slack etc in one sitting start with critical work prioritize tasks that unblock your time unblock others time make a visible impact for many that could be going through your email and setting tasks in motion for me it's streamlining my calendar and reviewing my emails communicate in a way that works for you musk prefers email because he's good at it if you're more persuasive in person then push for that instead communicating in a way that works for you is critical to getting your point across eliminate acronyms acronyms are supposed to save time and help you work faster but more often than not they can lead to misunderstandings so if it's a not well recognized acronym just drop it it's hot prioritize your common sense guidelines are built to help you work better if they're inhibiting progress or evidently wrong then just ignore them choose your common sense and make sure the guidelines get changed seek negative feedback pick a conflict and ask a third person to tear it down for you ask them what you did wrong and how you could do better it may hurt at first but can be very valuable in the long run and elon said especially seek negative feedback and that's interesting to me because that's the one of all those that i was i don't believe in that one i don't want to hear negative stuff negative is negative and elon's basically saying not really and i think you kind of put it well it's not that you're just looking for any and all negative feedback you're looking for someone that you trust that you actually would listen to if they were going to be giving you advice you let them give you the the feedback um you're not just taking out on the street hey what do you think about my shirt huh what do you think about my hat that's not what he's saying he's saying you know about your work specifically go to someone a third party not necessarily your boss or someone who assigned you the task go to somebody else and say what do you think here here's i'm laying it out for you what do you think i did wrong and i think this takes practice because when you hear negative stuff if you're not used to it you're immediately going to put your defenses up and it so probably takes a while for a lot of us to get used to oh okay he's not hurting my feelings it's constructive right and i think that this is the amazing part about elon is that he is such an effective engineer all the stuff that we've been hearing about in his tweets specifically about this is wow i feel i'm learning a lot this fun tweet that cyber rodeo at gigatexas is going to be on april 7th of course and if you want to watch the live stream we're going to do on april 7th that'd be great we want you to join us it's going to be a fun party so make sure you down below so you don't miss that renee tweeted out this quote from elon there are times when i'm lonely i'm sure there are times when everyone is lonely say if i'm working on the starship rocket and i'm just staying in my little house by myself especially if my dog is not with me then i feel quite lonely elon said true so this we're coming back to this new social media platform that elon talked about earlier prine said would you consider building a new social media platform elon one that would consist of an open source algorithm one where free speech and adhering to free speech is given top priority one where propaganda is very minimal i think that kind of platform is needed elon said i'm giving serious thought to this sasha said might become as successful as your pravda site back in 2018 and remember elon had said he wanted to start a new site where you would actually get to kind of rate the different news sources so that the crowd could kind of vote on who were better journalists it doesn't look he's ever done that i think to me this would actually be the more valuable thing he could create or that someone could create i've been kind of longing for this you used to back in the day read a newspaper or something because you thought the editors were really good at giving you the truth nowadays you're just reading endless articles from endless publications that you don't know who they are and so you don't know if you can trust them i hope here on this you're seeing that these are the two guys you either us or you don't and you can decide whether you trust what we're saying moshe said this could be stopped if tesla will enable sentry mode in israel elon do your magic and push in updates are expensive in israel beloved model 3s won't see any of this hatred anymore elon said looking into it so i guess sentry mode doesn't work in israel yeah i don't know the story behind that uh to our israeli viewers uh let us know what's going on in the comments below whoa costume change latest tweets here we go tesla silicon valley said fsd beta 10.11.1 is huge improvements best builds so far elon elon said this is pretty good 10.12 will have major improvements for tricky unprotected lefts and heavy traffic in general were also making good progress with single stack then he was asked what version are you driving elon said i usually drive an alpha build but switch to beta right before release so i know what tesla owners are getting he's so busy and yet he is also the beta tester is he really testing it out i'm just so curious he's in the driver's seat letting the car drive itself i'm just worried about that i don't want him driving around too much ilya said wake up from the deep dream elon said i just did now what pope of muskanity said now go back to sleep rest is important and i'll give the thumbs up and shira said sees the memes of production elon laughed the stoic emperor said art glamour and entertainment are all much diminished in hollywood the decaying cult of celebrity is what remains the public don't care what wins best picture they don't want to see it and won't it now takes celebrity bloodsport to cut through are you not entertained anyone said tick-tock now is he referring he's not spelling it tick-tock the app so it's it's the end of civilization oh i don't know holmar's catalog tweeted out a quote from elon for the hundredth time give my regards to your puppet master this is in reference to this editorial that was printed and i don't think it was printed uh correctly because elon then said ah yes i see they decided to editorialize here's what i actually said the washington post should change its tagline to democracy dies behind our paywall if you're so concerned about democracy stop forcing people to pay for allegedly important news your boss besos can certainly afford it even after buying a support yacht for his yacht ouch the washington post current slogan is democracy dies in darkness catchy for sure but then what's up with the paywall for news i don't know i just feel elon um how would you the news to be paid for i mean when i was a kid we would buy the newspaper or we'd buy a subscription to a magazine and yeah there's ads in it as well and that's how you pay for it how do you want this to be paid for does he want jeff bezos to pay for it because then it's funded by jeff bezos right that's not any better is it if a billionaire has i mean i don't know i just don't i don't follow the reasoning maybe i'm missing something uh elon says covet 19 is the virus of theseus how many gene changes before it's not covered 19 anymore i supposedly have it again psy but almost no symptoms wow so he's got covert again crap spacex tweeted out payloads for our upcoming fourth dedicated small sat rideshare mission transporter 4 were encapsulated into falcon 9's fairing last week on this flight are 40 spacecraft including cubesats microsats picosats hosted payloads and an orbital transfer vehicle they're all sitting there in the payload that's cool and elon said spacex falcon team is making excellent progress aiming for 60 launches this year starlink team 2 expecting over 4 200 starling satellites in operation within 18 months which is about two-thirds of all active satellites of earth massimo said water jet machines can cut any material ranging from the very soft such as foams gel sponges through to harder materials such as plastics composites aluminum the thicknesses of the cut materials reach up to 200 millimeters and not always 90 degrees elon said amazing what a zillion tiny cannonballs can do yeah so it's not just water it's uh you mix it with sand or something aggregate i kind of want one steven donziger said breaking youtube wipes out the entire archive of pulitzer winning journalist chris hedges including his interviews with me about my illegal chevron prosecution and detention censorship by big tech is the greatest threat to free speech today elon said i disagree with you but i disagree with deleting your stuff even more that's what free speech is about and then he went on say haha fine i probably don't disagree with you but even if i did then still yeah free speech isn't about agreeing with what someone says it's about the fact that you can say what you want to say right and honestly i hadn't heard about this story so it's nice that uh elon's tweets of the week can sometimes give you a piece of news that you haven't heard anywhere else yeah pope of muscanity said elon can you help a brother out and tell me when's the invite for the next wave of fsd beta canada if it's more than a week away tell me and i'll cancel the button and drive it's gran turismo 7 for a while elon said going out tonight for 99 scores now our friend chris at dirty tesla said many u.s 99 out of 100 scores have been waiting for months any new entrants soon and that is kind of the problem here is that they don't seem to need any new people at the moment niche gamer said morning nerds point of view you're chris rock and elon tweeted out rest here traveler you've seen too many will smith memes today shibatoshi nakamoto said elon have you been playing elden ring i resisted for a while but now i'm obsessed generic gaming bro elon said played some and will continue i use mouse and keyboard which is sub-optimal but okay with remapping art is incredible story is good although i'm still confused about what's going on haha non-linear play style and no spoon feeding are cool what's spoon feeding i think it's just easy peasy gameplay and stuff that then he was asked what's your favorite game right now he said i suppose it would be elden ring finished halo infinite on legendary which was not easy for my ancient neurons terminator resistance is underrated although the machines will be much better than this and have 360 degree long range field of view psi cyberpunk is brilliant now can we go back to the terminator resistance part that's a game is he saying although the machines will be much better than this does he mean the real machines the tesla bots that he's going to build i don't think he necessarily means the tesla bots but in in reality why would you make a robot that can only see you know a small cone of vision when if you had the capability to have do what terminators do you could just have cameras all the way around so he just gave us a glimpse into the scary future yeah elon said some people use meditation or yoga to calm their mind at the end of the day but games on hardcore mode works best for me dusty green said what would be an actual weapon that would work on machines og terminator energy weapons can we make something that could counter them in about 10 years and elon responded with magnets so okay probably electromagnetic pulses now this is one of those tweets that does give us insight into him that you would normally just kind of not even see or overlook and it's he's telling you that that's how he relaxes is on hardcore mode wow that tells you a lot about him science girl said a really dramatic example of the leidenfrost effect the moisture on his skin boils instantly forming a layer of steam that insulates for a very short time a temporary barrier between this person and the molten metal man elon said don't try this at home so yeah i mean this is a real effect that was not cgi but don't try it at home it's just a thin layer of water that is evaporating on your skin water's amazing sawyer merit says news a former official at a detroit branch of the united auto workers has pleaded guilty to charges that he embezzled more than two million dollars in union money he's the 17th defendant convicted in an ongoing uaw criminal investigation into corruption elon said uaw slogan fighting for the right to embezzle money from auto workers and uh he went on to say the uaw stole millions from workers whereas tesla has made many workers millionaires via stock grants subtle but important difference yeah uh i think uh point elon here it's hard to argue against that i mean it's not just one bad apple here it's the whole barrel it seems to be rotten teslarati tweeted out their article that tesla's elon musk cites popular eminem rap song in latest response to sec and elon said i mean we're basically identical a few differences maybe and here's what he said in his sec filing a piece of it the first amendment requires that agencies proceed with caution when constitutional rights are at stake not seek to pursue any and all novel theories that broaden their authority at the cost of individual freedom compare m m's without me 2002 the sec won't let me be or let me be me so let me see they tried to shut me down this is in reference to the fcc fining radio stations that played his song and he sued them saying that i have first amendment rights and then elon went on say the formal order is not an open invitation for any fishing expedition the commission may wish to pursue and the commission errors in assuming that a court may not look behind its veil to that end the sec twice denies that its subpoenas are issued under the consent decree instead stating unequivocally the subpoenas were issued under the authority granted by the formal order of investigation so i mean this is not over between the sec and elon tesla owners uk said hopefully not long until we get it here in the uk any idea of the time scale elon talking about fsd elon said fsd beta should be available in europe for left-hand drive this summer right-hand drive a few months later these dates depend on regulatory approval and then just if you didn't know one web which is a company similar to starlink they put up satellites to have internet they're much smaller than starlink but they were going to send their satellites up on russian rockets russia said no no no net so they looked to spacex and spacex said yes oneweb ceo neil masterson said we thank spacex for their support which reflects our shared vision for the boundless potential of space and elon said spacex will do the right thing for one web even though they are a competitor that's awesome elon could have just shut them down been you can't go on my rockets well i mean why not just get the money i mean if you're the toll keeper why not say yeah sure you can cross the bridge elon tweeted out sustainable energy generation from sun and wind is making great progress and this is in reference to uh the latest numbers showing that 10 of global electricity for the first time in the world came from solar and wind james says if because of wealth tax elon had left paypal with 60 million dollars less with tesla and or spacex have made it past 2008 kaplan doesn't think so either spacex or tesla would not exist elon said good point spacex and tesla would have probably died since both narrowly escaped bankruptcy in 2008. so that's an interesting way to think about that yeah how many businesses die because they're over taxed harsh imran said hey elon super charging has gotten very expensive in the last few weeks this is similar to filling up with gas at this point any idea why it's so expensive all of a sudden elon said we'll find out our aspiration is just to make a modest return versus the fully considered price of supercharging because harsh simran was in canada elon realized canada requires charging by the minute versus kilowatt hour we're working to get that changed yeah if you plug into supercharger in canada it's every minute you're there has nothing to do with how much was put into your battery and i mean tesla has tried to combat this by saying under a certain uh kilowatt charging speed will charge a different amount a lower amount if it if it you know when you're doing your taper charge but yeah this is a regulatory thing tesla has no control over being able to charge by the minute versus the kilowatt hour and it's stupid you wouldn't go to a gas station and they're all right well you've been there for five minutes two three all right especially if the amount could change right and lastly jonah critter said i would love to interview you for clean technica elon i believe in you support you and would never twist your words to fit a narrative would love the opportunity and he said okay well that's cool i love that he keeps being open to being interviewed by people you know we've seen him interviewed by sandy monroe and uh lex friedman so this is great we just get from a friendly person who's not gonna just take out little quotes and put them in an article that's that's wonderful i'm looking forward to that uh interview yeah she's a great writer uh thank you so much for joining us here on tweets of the week i love that you know this was a long tweet week and that we could dive into things and give you everything so that you can get a full narrative of what's going on in elon's mind and uh thank you for supporting the show see you next week now you know,0
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJmc2lGj1pSF0Joi0WXr5bnX,Yj0ck2nLRuc,hey everyone i'm zach and i'm jesse and you're watching elon's tweets of the week on now you know um now what are you doing we have to start the show okay hit the up button on your keyboard there and let's see what happens okay ow uh okay oh that didn't work what a surprise uh what are you trying to do here i was trying to make my own neural link and you know what i'm gonna say about that right you're you're gonna electrocute yourself um you should take some courses on brilliant today's sponsor how is brilliant going to help me learn about how neuralink works i mean brilliant teaches over 60 different courses in really easy to understand ways over 10 million people have learned from brilliant oh i suppose first i should have taken brilliance course on computer science foundations algorithm fundamentals data structures and intro to neural networks well that would be a good start with brilliance interactive problems and hints you're actually learning at your pace in a way that sticks in your brain instead of zapping your brain yeah i love brilliant storytelling it works for me or you could go back to hooking up wires to your head and see how that goes yeah good point i should save all the neurons i can to support our and learn more about brilliance go to brilliant.org now you know and sign up for free and also the first 200 people that go to that link will get 20 off the annual premium subscription all right jesse space hub tweeted out what's your guess we landed on the moon in 1969 when are we landing on mars with people see so it's people right i don't know uh take a guess i don't know 20 [music] 32 20 32 guess what elon said what 2029 seven years from now it's really exciting isn't it do you think he's right i mean it's smart you're shooting for the end of the decade didn't i hear him say before 2024 at one point would be when we'd actually land not people but some test rockets some time to no i'm just orbitz and i hope he's right that it's this decade would be awesome it would be really awesome elon's working on master plan part three we talked about this on test time news uh he did give an update main tesla subjects will be scaling to extreme size which is needed to shift humanity away from fossil fuels comma and ai so he's not shifting away from ai he kind of didn't right are we sure i listen that's that is some poor grammar it's not actually the comma it is it's not well structured but the comma means that that's a subject he's gonna do ai and i will also include sections about spacex tesla and the boring company i am super excited about master plan three i think i'm just conjecturing here i think he's gonna talk about tesla bots in a way that most people have not thought about i think when he talks about ai he's gonna talk about the tesla network in ways that people haven't really heard before i mean if you follow his twitter we do i don't think any of this is going to be new to be honest but i think that putting it into a encapsulated form that the press can pick up on is probably pretty smart i think that that is pretty smart uh he's had two master plans uh before and they usually make news when they come out um they don't you no one seems to go back and check and reference them and go oh this this is all according to elon's plan they're always just elon some wacky kooky guy who just kind of does whatever the heck he's thinking and it's plan number one all came true it's already done all game already completed master plan number one i mean that's pretty insane because yeah because it was impossible people were laughing him out of their right offices right i mean his plans are not tiny little plans back from 2006 yeah you couldn't buy an electric car in 2000 you were six years away from the model s it seemed a joke and he was talking about the model 3 in 2006 yep and he got it right it's amazing in about 10 years yeah it just wow he uh tweeted out working hard to make useful products and services for your fellow humans is deeply morally good i have so much respect for the associates doing an honest day's work at tesla or spacex building and servicing cars rockets starlinks batteries solar and many other things nice tweet there to his employees yeah massimo said hey elon if mars had ski slopes would they look this and elon said yeah uh so wait that's someone skiing in the sahara uh no this is dust from the sahara that got blown up into spain last week and kind of coated the snow with the layers and covered snow i don't know if i'd ski on that i feel that would ruin my skis now i'm just i mean i know that sand is teensy tiny have there ever been any species of land dwelling creatures that have been sucked up and thrown thousands of miles just are we okay but i mean is it the butterflies count they're so they're so light and they they migrate anything i'm saying i'm saying are we and that's why the welsh butter toad ended up in nova scotia has that ever happened probably i mean i've heard of you guys i've heard of frogs that get sucked up during rainstorms they don't go that far i'm talking 1000 i wanted to be what what is it it's a scorpion what's it doing here and you know this place okay yeah um but just to go back to mars do you think there's gonna be uh sand skiing in mars you get some sick air on mars because again it has about a third of the gravity of earth um i'm sorry i just came up with an awesome business idea sand skiing you uh you have alternates do something to make your skis work on sand and then you can ski anywhere where there's sand just go to the poles do it on marshmallows but then it's warm it's warm in a desert you can ski in the heat on mars no here on earth okay i mean ski jumps on mars with less gravity that's what i'm saying uh elon tweeted out fsd releasing to canada next week or this week now uh so i looked it up there's about 40 000 model 3s sold in canada so far since 2018. for context just in 2021 tesla sold 53 000 cars in california so i mean it's a pretty small market because obviously canada isn't as heavily populated but um a lot of excited canadians that is very exciting i wonder uh how many canadians are gonna sign up and pay for the subscription or buy fsd now that they can technically get it i know that a lot of them already have bought full self driving and i'm excited to see you know if there are differences between the two uh road systems right the independent tweeted out opinion how russell brand went from stand-up stardom to peddling youtube conspiracy theories elon said with so many mainstream media companies saying that rusty rockets or russell brand is crazy dangerous i watched some of his videos ironically he seemed more balanced and insightful than those condemning him the group think among major media companies is more troubling there should be more dissent and i followed uh russell brand for years as a comic when he was married to um who's the fireworks uh star oh katy perry katy perry okay um and their whole divorce and breakup whatever i always thought it was a funny comic and then he's you know kind of morphed into a youtube er um and yeah i mean it's easy to just blanketly say he looks a guru so he's crazy but if you watch his videos and he's a really smart person he may be a different you know political bent than you are but i don't i don't know about this conspiracy theory kind of stuff i think that yeah he's pretty smart guy um i just think that you know the media loves to label people and if you already have a label in mind when you then go watch someone you're okay so he must be crazy it's well do it elon did go back to first principles watch them and make up your own mind i don't know what they're specifically targeting i'm sure they're speaking about one particular i hate judging people based on one particular i just think that it's kind of stupid i think that you do have to take a whole person's work um to to kind of gain an understanding of who they are especially when they're a fairly nuanced person and have put out a lot of content someone russell brand so he's a really good interviewer and he has really good discussions with people so i mean i just i think that's a value to all of us it's the same kind of thing with the joe rogan thing where people go right joe rogan no um and look at his body of work i mean yeah he entertains a lot of uh ideas and uh i mean he's he is who he is well and also say that if you're putting out as much content as these guys are i mean we put out a lot of content but it's a lot of prepared content if you're having people on the show and it's just kind of going out there you don't know what you're going to get and i mean you know we do interviews with mainly companies so it's not a lot of crazy talk um but you know there's a lot of companies that you know we smile and nod along with and and at the end of the day we're yeah we weren't that impressed with them so you know i i always take this stuff with a with a grain of salt and i and i agree with elon's message here which is just you know before you get all um in a tizzy about something you know go do your own research yeah remember you said before so much of our programming is who put it there did did you put it there so make up your mind by actually going and doing the work yourself which most people are too lazy to do mg siegler said several years into gdpr which means general data protection regulation it remains [ __ ] bonkers in practice every site on the internet gets an awful pop-up that no one reads and clicks anything to make go away as quickly as possible it's an idea that 100 backfired and is pointless and makes every website worse and elon said absolutely so what we're talking about here is you go into most sites somewhere down the bottom usually as a box that says do you agree to cookies another bubble bloop and the bottom it's usually you're reading and then all of a sudden pop up right do you agree do you want to do this and then the other thing and also there's a fourteen thousand different types of cookies that we're gonna put here's the thing i hate if i go into let's say a german site and a german cookie thing pops up i can't read it i can't anything to translate it so i don't know what i'm clicking i don't even know which button it means what and i have to just okay what if i the wrong button do i now get cookies right um and and then i think that hackers can take advantage of this because i think that they can just put up something and we're so used to just clicking quickly to get off of it that it could say do you want a stick over a computer yeah so i agree with elon and this is you know the law of unintended consequences right it i'm sure it had a good purpose but it's completely backfired and who the heck is changing this shibatoshi nakamoto said i need a new excuse to avoid people since no one cares about covet anymore elon said the limbic instinct for vengeance is incredibly strong which is why turn the other cheek is such a powerful idea as it ends the cycle of retribution and i just want to stop here for a second and it's really true limbic instinct meaning you insult me and i just have a base instinct to want to punch you right and it's hard because we're just animals to stop and go okay well he just said some words to hurt my feelings but you know what i can walk away and i think you know he brings up a really good point if if you can stop that cycle because if i do punch you okay well then now you hate me and it never ends and that's a problem with humans is that we start with something as simple as you know a comment on a where you don't someone and it ends up god knows where it ends up right i i think it's so interesting that elon can bring up conversations this no other ceos are bringing up philosophical or ethical thoughts this but here's the problem with twitter sure it's you go out into the town square you say something this right and some smart people respond with some smart comments and then a whole bunch of other people doge to the moon and it's okay well you can't now now you have to just be okay goodbye and that's what elon does he puts out something intelligent and then quickly leaves because there's so much crap on twitter and there's no smart ai on twitter when is twitter going to come up with an ai that i don't want to hear the doge the moon stuff so don't make me physically go through and mute all those people because that just takes my mind do it for me leave the smart people i introduce me to some new smart people it's not hard to do curate some stuff yeah and also get rid of the bots yes the bots oh my gosh i mean i know that most of the people watching this right now the reason that you're watching that is because a twitter is impossible to just navigate hard to find all of elon's tweets i mean we and then put them in context exactly and well and then just to f just to go it's just so awful to deal with yeah i mean i signed up for twitter and i was well i'm gonna use twitter and then i was no i'm not i know elon retweeted the spacex tweet falcon 9's first stage has landed on the just read the instructions drone ship this is the first time a falcon 9 first stage has launched and landed 12 times now stop stop right there for one second okay so the falcon 9 first stage right is the rocket 14 story rocket at the bottom of the falcon 9 rocket when you see it go up it's the thing that's on fire at the bottom along with the you know the most of the rocket it's launched and landed 12 times he's recouping the cost on that investment in ways that no rocket has ever done not only that but he's showing people and companies that this is reliable this is on a drone ship in the ocean not even on land again yeah do you know how hard it would be to even hit that thing i know and and it goes out into the ocean into the ocean a rocket made out of you know metals and stuff and then it comes back and gets reused and gets reused i mean sometimes days later i feel i've taken uh a car on a ferry before and and just been what is going on afterwards because it just started to rust spontaneously this is what i love about elon years before he did it everyone i mean everyone in the industry said you can't do it and what did elon do oh well i'm i think it's not impossible i'm going to try it anyway it's really hard hey did you know that it's actually really hard to do that uh here's a here's the thing that i think is really hard and you know what's also funny he's been doing it for years now yeah ula i know ariane i know uh russia where's your rocket that can land itself nowhere yeah uh elon tweeted out and this is very apropos geniuses are often rejected by society of course that's one way to cook a pizza uh well it's actually the only way or one of the only ways that you could cook two round pizzas round pizzas on a square rack of that size yeah math and again it shows he thinks of solutions that most people wouldn't think of i mean he didn't think of this one no i know some other genius thought of that one right so teslarati tweeted out tesla model x five-seater deliveries begin is their new hope for a seven-seat plaid variant elon said the six-seat model x is best in my opinion there are times when i only want to offer that variant interesting we've got a seven seat model x and um yeah there are times when it is a little tricky to get out of those sixth and seventh seats in the back there so i can see why but on the other hand it's nice when you do have seven people you want to carry around spidey elon fan said giger berlin is around 20 minutes from berlin and has a total area of 1.2 square miles over 8 000 employees at giger berlin conceptualized in 2015 more than 10 european countries had campaigned to have the factory located within their jurisdictions graffiti at giga is fire anyone said giga berlin brandenburg will be covered with beautiful art inside and out i mean they've already got some beautiful art on the outside there ben bergman who is by the way a business insider writer said the very rare time as a tesla owner i wish i could pay six dollars a gallon for gas and be on my way we need more superchargers elon and elon said working on it here's what i don't i don't business insider um never liked them um they've always had a very always funny always very funny yeah um and very negative on tesla yeah and so this is one of those um you know i'm a tesla owner but kind of things and uh so yeah you want to pay six dollars a gallon and support the fossil fuel industry go right ahead now remember elana tweeted i hereby challenge putin to single combat stakes no you know what i want to go back i want to talk more about that [ __ ] tweet okay this this guy they they're making new superchargers practically every day right we cover it on tesla time news every week um last week we had what was it 12 15 new supercharger stations in the world of course there are some locations where there's a crowd here and there very local it's it's usually really big population of teslas right these people somehow don't want to charge at home not what the supercharger network was made for in my opinion i don't think that it's just supposed to be this well i don't feel charging plugging in at my house no and you know what no other car maker has a charging network every other car maker uses someone else's network network so ben bergman are you saying that just ev's i mean i guess he wants to pay for gas he wants to pay six dollars a gallon for gas do you care about the environment you care about people other people's wallets i mean we were on here the other week talking about yeah i think that this is why the government should support uh subsidies for evs it's not just because i think that evs are the greatest it's because i think that people don't deserve to be paying six dollars for gas they didn't do anything to deserve that so why are you asking for six times six dollars a gallon for gas and also i wish i could pay you can go buy another car we don't need you exactly or go charge an electrify america station oh that's right house it's simple you charge at your house most of the time where is this supercharger where is it i don't know he didn't say hey this area needs more superchargers right we've all been saying different areas need more superchargers but also the ceo of tesla gets back to you and says we're working on it and they actually are he's not even lying we're working on it yeah they've been working on it since 2015 bud exactly so i will move on to uh elon remember hit challenge putin to single combat the stakes are ukraine and cz binance said brother i wish for you to win of course but the reality is laffy face i haven't seen your kung fu videos and then elon put up a picture of his sumo wrestling where he said i managed to throw him but it cost me smashing my c5 and c6 disc and eight years of mega back pain finally fixed with c5 c6 disc fusion ouch yeah i know what back pain feels but look at that guy look at this guy i bet you every time elon sees that picture he goes oh and then yeah so yeah i think he has a good chance against putin well if it was super wrestling yeah i mean it depends what challenge they i mean here's the thing with elon he's kind of crazy you know i mean he might do the things that he's done yeah i mean he did he you know if you look at it not from a physical fighting perspective but i mean he doesn't give up no that's that's a little scary yeah chibitoshi nakamoto said if no one comes from the future to stop you from doing it then how bad can it be and elon said okay maybe i should play a league then so what's he referring to he's talking about league of legends it's a game and is it a oh it's oh that game right now is that the one that's highly addictive and you end up playing it all night kind of thing yeah i don't think elon's ever had time to do that popo muskanity said so this is how the world ends with you going back in time to prevent yourself from playing league and causing a time paradox when you meet yourself destroying all of reality and elon laughed i mean that's that's good elon said excited to hand over the first production cars made by giger berlin brandenburg tomorrow and then on tuesday of course gigger berlin opened and they handed over the first 30 cars yeah so i guess uh bob and bob should redo the show uh the giga cup has been won by berlin it looks exactly ashley vance said sometimes i think google translate is having a go at russia's space chief and so here's the russian here's the google translation what nonsense space is not able to do what our frigate did one web is doomed despite your warm hands from the applause what are you happy about demagoguery of a boa constrictor with a chicken that they were lucky to meet on a narrow path i'm sorry one web but they are to blame and then elon tweeted out a snake chicken so i think that um where goes in i i hate making people a punching bag but he makes it so easy oh yeah um so he's i if i can have a little poetic license or something uh he is saying we cancelled the deal with one web because of all of your sanctions against our country because we invaded ukraine um and he's going and so and so in the news recently uh oneweb which is another satellite internet company um had to basically they were told the russians were not going to be carrying their satellites into orbit anymore and uh that brings us to these next tweets here yeah michael sheets says quilty analytics found that u.s space companies are poised to benefit from russia cutting itself off from much of the global space industry with spacex the clear winner in the launch market exemplified this morning by oneweb's new deal elon said spacex default plan was roughly 65 of global launch mass to orbit this year incremental demand might take up to 70 percent so not a major change those numbers don't count starship rough math is 16 tons times 50 launches equals 800 tons rest of the world is less than 400 tons mostly china and so uh yeah one web basically was going to be launched on a russian rocket and one web to remind everyone is going to be kind of a star link kind of a starlink they don't have as many satellites up in orbit and i don't think they plan to have quite as many satellites as starlink um it's not exactly the same kind of web service do you remember for a while the word out on the street was that one web was going to kick starlinks but because starlink would take too long and one web would be first and just a reminder that you can't always rely on the word on the street because uh if you did the if you just looked at it uh you have starlink which is spacex and spacex has those reusable rockets which means that you can get into orbit a lot cheaper than having to deal with the russians and then if there's some kind of global conflict you know that's going to be your business plan's kind of three business plans so now your competitor has to bring you to space and so yeah one web is now paying spacex to launch their satellites into orbit what a weird world what interesting fascinating elon went on say first starship orbital flight will be with raptor 2 engines as they are much more capable and reliable 230 tons or about 5 000 pounds of thrust at sea level will have 39 flight worthy engines built by next month then another month to integrate so hopefully may for orbital flight test evelyn said will starship sn20 and super heavy booster 4 still conduct the orbital flight or is it new prototypes and elon said new oh so okay so we've kind of pushed back then what i was hoping was going to be the first orbital flight looks now we're looking at may but this would be with an even better improved starship so okay and then to end the show let's end on a good note elon said thanks germany and that is of course because they've opened the gigafactory how exciting i'd be thanking germany too after all the crap that they put them through with environmental studies and all this stuff and it's you're not gonna have enough water yeah and now you took down the trees it's all it's all open they saved the lizards yeah we did it wow congratulations tesla this is everyone working in tesla i want to give give yourself a pat on the back um because it's a monumental moment so monumental i think that we're going to be looking back on this moment in particular as one of the biggest moments in tesla history and in the history of the world in terms of the transition to uh clean renewable energy i mean a year from today what is europe going to look you know german car company that's a weird way that's a weird thing to say yes on so many levels but what will the car industry in uh europe look it's uh it's gonna be this is gonna be huge exciting times very exciting thank you so much for joining us for this tweets of the week we're having so much fun doing it thank you for loving the show so many people are messaging me and being thank you for breaking this up into a separate show we're just happy to do it so thank you for that if you want to support us head on over to patreon for as little as a buck a month you can see all of our patreon bonus stories and you might be wondering zack and jesse did why did you change shirts in the middle of the show we record this on two different days right we got to give you the last up to the minute tweets we recorded this as soon as we could they're right i mean not right now uh two a couple minutes ago before this came out our editors were working on editing this together so that you could watch it and uh yeah i want to thank our patrons again because they are the ones supporting this making this possible and making this show possible for you to see so if you want to help support us zach said you can head over to patreon.com now you know see you next week now you know,0
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJmc2lGj1pSF0Joi0WXr5bnX,s49jMLLpc6g,hey everyone i'm zach and i'm jesse and you're watching elon's tweets of the week on now you know uh this is weird yeah we're not normally here talking about tweets of the week we used to be on ttn doing it and then we were just doing it for the patrons but it's been so popular and i honestly didn't realize it was so popular because it's buried in you know it's buried in the test time news show but everyone clamored for it when it was taken out so we thought you know what let's make it even better first of all everyone can get it and we can spend more time we don't have to just rattle off the tweets we can also give you our insights into them and i want to thank our patrons for making this show possible we started out by giving this just to our patrons and they all said basically uh guys this is great but you got to show everybody else um honestly we wouldn't have even tried it though if it weren't for our patrons because yeah i wanted to talk about elon's tweets a little bit more so let's talk about elon's tweets so check this out this is from visual capitalist this is a decade of elon's tweets visualized wow we'll put the link so you can check out deeper this is basically showing through time uh what he's tweeting about red being spacex green being tesla and then of course there's other things as well so it gives you an idea of um where he's been in his mind wow all right but elon tweeted out hopefully it is now extremely obvious that europe should restart dormant nuclear power stations and increase power output of existing ones this is critical to national and international security for those who mistakenly think this is a radiation risk pick what you think is the worst location i will travel there and eat locally grown food on tv i did this in japan many years ago shortly after fukushima radiation risk is much much lower than most people believe also nuclear is vastly better for global warming than burning hydrocarbons for energy now i'm sorry but elon i personally have to disagree with you mark frondmeier ceo of arcimoto also does he said did you miss the part where the nuke plant was getting shelled in the conflict and the operators were quit that or it'll be a worldwide disaster these artifacts are not good to leave lying around suggest encouraging folks to consume less power so this is um a bit of a controversy in the uh green space let's call it the green space and with any community there's going to be disagreements and stuff that and i think that it's important to talk about all of it um what i want to say here is that elon is being very reactionary to fuel prices yes um why is he being so reactionary to fuel prices i don't know i love the fuel prices are going up actually i know it sucks for all of us i don't drive a nice car but yes my broccoli is more expensive because the trucks use gas to get the broccoli to me so we're all feeling it i want us all to feel it you know why because we need to make the switch and the more painful something is sometimes the faster you make the switch right so i'm sorry but that's just the way it is if gas prices come down everyone will forget about switching evs and they'll go back to their gas guzzling suv now i think that elon is more worried about the global economy he very much seems to me to very much be worried about the state of the world all the time and he's doing pretty much the most about it that anyone has ever done um he's trying to get us off the planet not all of us but trying to uh save the species get a planet b right in case something goes wrong over here which i won't say is out of the question but anyway um yeah hurry up elon so this this nuclear reactor thing he's also said that he wants to increase oil and gas production in the u.s basically to offset the russian fuels now i just feel this is a talking point that is co-opted by the oil and gas industry of course they're profiting from this right now and they're not even profiting from it right now you might be thinking well of course they're going to increase their output oh yeah no they're not it's going to be it's going to take six to nine months if today okay things went back to normal it would take six nine months before gas prices would come down why because they're going to continue profiting from it they're not going to just immediately drop the prices that's not how it works right they're basically this is a lot of price gouging with a little bit of market stuff i forget what the saying is but basically prices go up fast and they come down slow and that's always been the case i mean we have to look at this in totality the oil and gas industry wants to use this as a banging drum to say help support us all they want is new oil and gas leases not leases that they're going to start drilling tomorrow nope these are oil and gas leases that they want to have just in the reserve that they're ready for so that way later on they can go oh i'm sorry we started drilling here oops well you you allowed us to do it back when you thought that the russians were going to invade everybody and and now we get to profit from it you know five ten years from now also we're creative people are so if there's a problem we can find creative ways to solve it and when the price of gas goes up just mark pointed out you can conserve more that's option number one we just don't do it because it's so easy not to do it i think that this is making a lot of people right now go oh what are some other options and i think that's a great thing to be asking ourselves but gail tweeted out this quote i didn't remember elon going back to fukushima back in 2011 from the mayor of soma city saying we are grateful to elon and the musk foundation for this generous gift and for coming such a long way to personally visit soma city elon said it was an honor and basically he was going there to give them solar panels and to help them out and hiro mitsuno who's now on the board of tesla said thanks for your gift and more importantly showing your support for friends and trouble elon you're one of the few who travel to japan and to the affected region hope we won't waste it and finally make renewables mainstream in japan elon then responded in japanese a little bit wrong actually if you look at the translation he said a true friend is someone who walks away as the world leaves hiro corrected him and said a true friend walks to you when the world walks away from you so i mean again i understand where elon is coming from this is not i don't think that elon is stupid for saying this i can see the point that he's trying to drive home um and he's very anti-russia especially right now and so yeah he wants to stick it to the russians and part of that is that people are just very much worried about their oil and gas prices and if they remain high it doesn't really go well for other parts of the world maybe not main street usa but maybe other parts of the world are going to be um bad but look the sooner we get off russian oil and oil in general the better and sometimes you have to get through the pain to get to the solution i think that's the case here it's not going to be easy getting off oil elon musk tweeted this out and uh i need your help deciphering it you are my favorite hello and my hardest goodbye so he's either talking about going poop or he's talking about odysseus because this is a line from homer's iliad and they were going to name his daughter odysseus but i guess he won out over grimes remember we talked about that on ttn yeah so i don't know if he's talking to his new daughter or if he's just talking about sitting on the toilet i don't get the first one but okay sure well he makes a lot of these kind of tweets that you can't understand until you put them in the context of being on the toilet about pools and stuff okay you know give me a break you want me so you want more context i want less if this is a poop joke i want less poop it may not be i don't know i just don't know uh mark andreessen said the plan esg funds will invest in defense companies to make the weapons required to fight wars with hostile regimes we buy energy from because esg funds won't invest in energy companies and just to remind you esg means environmental social and governance and here's the wikipedia definition elon said esg rules have been twisted to insanity and basically what we're talking about here is this quote we believe defense is likely to be increasingly seen as a necessity that facilitates esg as an enterprise as well as maintaining peace stability and other social goods city analysts wrote in a note this morning recent events in europe we think will significantly increase the likelihood of defense's inclusion in the eu's social taxonomy so basically kind of co-opting what esg should be about which is making um your governance your social and environmental stuff strong now somehow we've thrown in defense um well you got to throw in defense you know what's a good esg fund without a couple tanks in there huh brett winton from arkhanvest said just indicative of how esg framing has always been broken backwards looking massively subjective to the moment's political whim rewards compliance reporting and box checking at the expense of rewarding perspective impact elon said esg should be deleted if not fixed and just to point out what we're talking about here let's take tesla's scorecard on esg and toyota's scorecard now before i even show you this who do you think wins um a company that makes nothing but evs and solar or a company that makes ice cars uh tesla okay so okay you're voting tesla is that your final answer yeah okay here are the score cards tesla gets a 29 they're in the 59th percentile medium and toyota gets a 30 which is 63rd percentile or high po of muscanity says tesla deserves to be treated as an esg champion the fact that it isn't is proof that esg is just another exercise in greenwashing okay i don't think i get esg no what what it's a lot of bull but what is it i don't even get it right what is this since we've been doing this show esg has become a term right now we've been interviewing ceos and companies and they start talking about esg it's that basically uh companies have to have all of these policies and things in place that green wash basically i mean look in a perfect world it wouldn't be green washing in a perfect world it would be hey we're trying to do the right thing as a company so we're trying to be carbon neutral and all that you know all this good stuff but in reality what it basically is for a lot of companies is hey look at us we're green because how can toyota beat tesla in this score there's no freaking way if this were if this were true report card they would be at the bottom and tesla would be at the top right wow all right this tweet from elon alright what are the circled letters add up to jesse satoshi naka moto satoshi nakamoto creator of bitcoin ring a bell okay so he satoshi nakamoto is the half of all these companies i don't understand i don't know maybe the person who came up that name was he's japanese aha we've solved it he must be japanese because you see very good justin we've solved it wow good one is that it that's a tweet but i mean is that what he meant no don't know i don't what what just i think elon just getting us thinking you know oh man keep you up keeping the ball if i feel if only it did mean something it might be a nasty maybe somewhere kind of maybe satoshi nakamoto was sitting around one day trying to figure out what fake name he'd use and he was looking at a bunch of boxes you know he's wrapping some presents and he said ah i don't know i don't know ashley vance uh that awesome author uh these four tech companies have almost as much cash 589 billion as russia stashed away for war in the entire country 630 billion elon said wow he actually then said i feel you'd figure out something interesting to do with the cash rather than just sitting on an empire's worth peter thiel's argument that you might not be a tech company anymore if you don't have big ideas does feel true sometimes now ashley isn't talking to elon no because he isn't elon isn't sitting on that much cash oh no not even remotely close no we're talking about those four companies apple alphabet microsoft and amazon they're sitting on a lot of cash i mean look at how much cash apple's sitting on 200 billion dollars i'm sorry you're not as a company you're not supposed to sit on cash you're supposed to do stuff what are they going to do with it though right they're going to just burn it all and i think if they started burning it now they'd not even get through it i don't i don't know that's a lot of probably don't even have it in physical cash no they do not no they can't imagine if they went to their bank withdrawal eva fox said projects focused on renewable energy in germany should move with tesla speed says robert hoback and he is a green energy uh party member and elon said very important that there be an organization tasked with regulation removal or the number of rules will grow every year until progress is completely buried by bureaucracy so it's interesting i'm sorry but buried by bureaucracy is the greatest band name i've ever heard oh that's pretty good hey everybody we're buried by bureaucracy we're going to be out in 25 minutes we have to do some paperwork here well every day they come out they're just fill out this paperwork before we can play does anyone need hearing protection so elon does this interesting thing where when he's talking about a specific country directly to the world not in a tweet reply he is usually very positive he usually um speaks the language of that country and he says just a lot of positive stuff this tweet reply very interesting how he is not saying the word germany in that entire tweet didn't say germany at all you can take it as a generalized statement because it is but if you look at it in context it is very directed to germany um it's a really interesting way that he is able to i don't know some might say dog whistle but i to me it's just a very political way it's a very stupid comment exactly yep all right for all you rocket scientists out there everyday astronaut said anyone out there have a trade-off chart between tank pressure and tank weight for copvs maybe someone at cop sub has dealt with this i was making an estimate but i fear i can't totally wing it i had planned haha now uh copvs are composite overwrapped pressure vessels of course um obviously i mean we're gonna have one in the roadster and so basically what this is is a um it's a tank it's a high-tech a high-pressure tank um the composite over-wrapped generally means that it's a carbon fiber right to hold more with lighter weight um and elon said in our experience copv gain over pain flattens out above 6000 psi and is less than one above 10 000 psi unless volume constrained dragon heating from pressurization and cooling from depressurization also become major problems at very high pressure i mean that's what i've found of course um so this is a bunch of rocket science jargon it can we this is again we never get to talk about this on tweets of the week when exactly no i wanted to ask you about it because normally we'd cut tweets this because they're interesting but they have to be explained and i can't explain them so everyday astronaut is talking about the copvs and he's saying why is he making a rocket by the way or is he just trying to understand i think he's just trying to understand and explain to everyone which is he does a very good job at so he's asking this question because he's hoping someone's going to answer it you have elon musk anyone out there and he's i'll answer it for you right um i'm the chief rocket scientist so i'll tell you right so i mean basically 6000 psi is where you want to be just to give you some um reference points your tires are about 40 psi a nail gun is about 100 psi we're talking 6 000 psi pounds per square inch yeah that's a lot and it's especially light it's that's really good for rocks is this the standard by the way pounds per square inch that seems so imperial why is there a metric equivalent um newtons per square meter it's um uh i think it's still weird i don't know i don't know there's so many different there's bar there's oh yeah bar he talks about embark i atmospheres that gives me i always visualization atmospheres although psi i've just grown up with it but i don't know holmar's catalog snuck this in there because if you sneak stuff in when he's talking about rocket stuff he's very talkative that's just a little hint that i'm giving you here uh said fsd beta update and just uh before we get the answer um homer's catalog does this a lot so does uh tesla owner silicon valley they know that if they just keep trying it i think they must have done this 40 times before where he doesn't respond and then this is some weird pavlovian experiment right where you just keep saying fsc update fsc update and occasionally he says this weekend yeah so we got our answer and uh yeah as we saw last weekend it did start rolling out prenate said the capability of starship is mind-blowing and he put up this chart which isn't even accurate elon had to kind of tweak it elon says optimized fully reusable starship is about 150 tons to the same reference orbit as saturn v in expendable mode starship payload would be 250 tons to 300 tons okay so why does he get a doubling of the usable um capability you know what you can put in it if you make it expendable it would be expendable what's so when they launched the saturn v rocket it was expendable it didn't come back didn't come back it burned up in the atmosphere crashed onto the oh okay so if you're willing to make starship not come back you can put more weight in it because otherwise you have to put more fuel in it yes okay gotcha because otherwise yeah it has to turn around see i think this is one of the problems with when you get into rocket science right is that most of us don't use words expendable very often or payload and stuff that and so for the the general public i think we see these things 150 t and we just lose interest i love charts and stuff because that helps a lot but yeah i wish in a way i mean i know of course you have to have jargon in in things but i wish there was yeah more of this visualization that people could get behind be whoa big rocket you know yeah and i mean i think i don't think it's actually i don't think that rocket science is actually that hard um and you might be saying whoa jesse what are you talking about it i'm saying yes the nitty-gritty nuts and bolts of it very hard the the general concepts of it i think most people could understand as long as they were taught if they played with it and they played with and you know maybe you're new to the whatever but we talk about kerbal space program a lot it's a really fun space program that's a game but it's also realistic it uses physics ish i mean right it's a yeah you get to play around off of a planet go to go land on any of the any of these orbital bodies within a a solar system you can land on uh this version of the moon you can go land on their version of the of mars um and they they've scaled down the earth-like planet so that way it doesn't take you know 25 minutes to get into orbit it takes two minutes i mean imagine if they had had this when you were a kid we could have played hey let's figure out how we can get to the moon you know or mars and you can do that now it's incredible and design rovers when you're done playing this you will actually almost be a rocket scientist you'll be at least able to understand what all this is all of the concepts are really well executed and you know we have a remember we did this years ago we did a a play it was episode one right where you kind of uh showed it to me so uh we'll put a link to it here you can go check that out if you're interested all right so this next tweet is really interesting okay so put your thinking caps on imagine an atom scattering machine completely disassembles your body's atoms into a cloud of floating atoms then it perfectly reassembles the atoms and you walk out feeling totally normal is the new you still you and here was the poll and most people said yes elon said what if one atom at a time in your body was switched out for another atom there would be u with all new atoms and another u with the original atoms human of theseus so i spent so much time thinking about this as a kid because i watched star trek and the other day we were having lunch with the crew and i was talking about the replicator because remember we interviewed matt maher he's the ceo of canna by the way go check out that interview amazing they basically made the star trek replicator to some extent but for drinks but for drinks and i would think about getting on to you know scotty beam me up and i would think about the transporter which is for all of you don't know star trek is how you get beamed around right and i thought so often about okay so what what just happened there all my atoms where did they go did it get stored digitally and then sent down i mean we don't know how it works because it's not real but that does bring up this question if you're atoms i mean going back to this original question here is the new you still you right and it brings into the it brings into play all of this questions of consciousnesses and stuff that and then it brings up this point that the underdoge said then maybe with neuralink you could download all your information into the new body and you could potentially live forever that way question mark i mean look i'm not saying that's going to happen tomorrow but you could technically take your consciousness from neurolink which you know someday could be better than it is today and and learns about all your brain stuff store it digitally because your brain is just a bunch of neurons right and then remake yourself i mean i know it sounds crazy but would that still be you and then when i was a kid i would think about okay well how about the cells in your body i learned as a kid that you get new ones all the time right and i've done some research and basically the oldest cells in your body are in some of your bone marrow but even those every seven years or so are new so basically seven years ago when you started watching the show none of these cells were here i was a completely different person so am i still zach right so it's a very it it's again one of these uh philosophical conversations that you'd have you know with someone and you'd be wow that was really deep physical you know philosophical conversation except that now so many other things elon is getting us much closer to kind of answering those questions yeah speaking of deep philosophical questions howard altman says russian defense ministry the united states is training migratory birds to migrate from ukraine to russia and distribute bacteriological weapons one question african or european that of course from monty python and elon said little do they know birds aren't real now he doesn't really believe this it's a joke it's a joke it's a joke people don't take it seriously he was in a jokey mood if you chart his tweets and because we've been doing this for years now uh he does seem to go through a thing where he almost gets that he might have been too cerebral for a while so then he does some dad jokes and here's another one uh he tweeted this out he retweeted this out a selection of old assyrian documents in the yale babylonian collection um and basically he said the forbidden cereal and then of course that led to questions milk first or cereal first and elon said cereal but maybe i've been doing it wrong all this time i know it's bad for you but sugared cereal is amazing and just this is why i do tweets of the week okay because in what seemed a just complete waste of tweets we learned that elon has a thing for sugared cereal which i mean we all do we talk about on the show we're sponsored by magic spoon sometimes and um but the problem is if he's eaten a lot of cereal [music] of the wrong kind that's not good for you okay and in this recent vanity fair article with the grimes did you learned a lot about the fact that they don't eat well she talked about eating peanut butter for eight days straight in their little forty thousand dollar home down in boca chica and it's what the what well i know that elon doesn't have a lot of time for things and he doesn't make a lot of time for himself sure okay but i have a uh ever heard of green chef or blue apron or just a personal chef because you're a billionaire uh i mean i don't think anyone would uh hold a grudge against somebody he's a busy guy no i'm not gonna or take out i do you know good takeout sure or just yeah any all of the above or an intern thing anything pasta i don't know all right how about this it was 20 years ago today jesse this was spacex in 2002 we've seen this picture before we even have a t-shirt of you know elon dancing uh he said i love the mariachi uh this picture was from 20 years ago also spacex's humble beginnings in el segundo california 20 years ago 20 years is not that long to go from this to launching the falcon 9s and starship and starlinks that are saving ukraine to do something that everyone said was impossible to re-land a rocket then now we're talking about going to mars and he started you know if this is not inspirational i don't know what it is it's amazing elon tweeted this out 15 decisive battles of the world that's from this book and he said it's insightful analysis is sconced in eloquent prose pope of muskanity said i wish people read more history it's not just about repeating it's actually about learning from it what works and what doesn't work it's about understanding our place in space and time on that blue marble a study of history by arnold j toynbee is one of my favorites elon said always worth reading about the many civilizations that have risen and fallen lessons we should take to heart there is a danger to a united earth that it may result in a collective fall or ossification of civilization another reason why we do this show yeah to tell you what ossification means well what does that mean what's it mean i don't know what it means yeah i don't know the natural process of bone formation the hardening of muscular tissue into a bony substance a mass or particle of ossified tissue the tendency towards or state of being molded into a rigid conventional sterile or unimaginative condition and so united earth he's kind of against united earth this means he's against you know the federation the star trek federation you know is it i don't know maybe what he means is that i mean he likes a little little give and take a little competition a little differences that's why he wants to go to mars yeah screw screw united earth yeah it's going to be better on mars we have united morse uh and then he asked a question what are your thoughts about probable inflation rate over the next few years tesla and spacex are seeing significant recent inflation pressure in raw materials and logistics and we are not alone and he tweeted out this financial times article about how the prices of things grain are going through the roof because russia and ukraine typically produce a lot of grain yeah a quarter of the world's grain a lot of it michael saylor the big bitcoin aficionado tweeted out u.s consumer inflation will continue near all-time highs in asset inflation run it double the rate of consumer inflation weaker currencies will collapse and the flight of capital from cash debt and value stocks to scarce property bitcoin will intensify well no wonder he'd say that well elon said it's not entirely unpredictable that you would reach that conclusion and then of course he left off with i support the current thing wow okay so that's a very right-wing picture yeah i for someone who supports the current thing right it's kind of a weird he's so interesting how he you really can't nail him down you know conservatives sometimes will be he's on our side and liberals be he's on our side and i don't think he's on any particular one group side he has his own philosophy and that merges or doesn't merge with groups and i think we've become so pushed to our sides that we don't see that we really do agree on a lot in the middle it's just that we we're so triggered and i think this goes back to his ossification he's showing hey let's stay open-minded about stuff guys well and also he's moved to texas and i think that that has a lot to do with it i think that you can't really move to texas and i think he's also surrounded himself with a lot of people who influenced him to move to texas because i think that basically what happens is um all these people made a lot of money in california in silicon valley then they have a lot of money suddenly and they go wait taxes are a thing taxes suck i hate taxes where can i have no taxes this is this when george harrison of the beatles finally got a big tax bill and then wrote taxman because he was just i didn't know this was the thing before right and so i think that that's kind of pushing a lot of these very innovative people to texas and then i think that that's kind of mingling and mixing with the culture and that you get a tweet that's sort of that i just this is one of those times where i'm just elon really i know you don't have to tweet that no you can be a little more thoughtful with your tweets you're just taking some talking point and you're tweeting that right it's a little disappointing to me yeah i agree there is plenty of discussion and healthy debate that could be had and yet you're gonna just put it down to a meme i often wonder if he does this to actually make it so that you just can't really pin him down you know that he's almost being obtuse you know or you know in high school there was that kid and he was just you know always talking about stuff that he probably didn't fully understand just to seem cooler than he was i wonder if there's a little bit of that in there too he sometimes goes so off topic on things nuclear power i will say for such a brilliant guy um he missed out on one big thing going back to that first tweet about nuclear power current nuclear power plants they're not the clean kind that everyone's talking about can be you know the future of it they do make waste that we don't know what to do with and that is dangerous and we're seeing you know mark pointed out a nuclear power plant can be targeted and they're vastly more expensive than renewables right they take vastly longer to get up and running right so i mean yes he's talking about specifically the existing uh dormant but i would argue that the fact that you know uh germany stopped using them yes they did have to switch to coal for a while but also now they're switching to solar and wind faster than they ever would have it just it makes the transition faster i don't know it just seems very short-sighted to me that he doesn't see that for a guy whose companies are so long well and it is all about accelerating the transition right yeah so i yeah again tweets this i don't think help accelerate the transition i think they just get a bunch of people to be mad at you yeah which i mean maybe he likes maybe he doesn't want to be the darling of any particular yeah he's just he's just shifting himself to be the darling of the right which i mean has advantages i'm not going to lie but at the same time you're just going to be alienating half of your audience i think that there's plenty of room in the middle to be standing right but all those tweets were leading up to the main event i didn't know what to make of this when i read it this is ilona musk he's changed his name now uh and he says i hereby challenge vladimir putin to single combat stakes are ukraine and then in russian do you agree to this fight dmitry rogozin basically he's one of the heads of state of russia uh gave this quote from pushkin you little devil are still young compete with me weakling it would only be a waste of time overtake my brother first and then ilona said i see you're a tough negotiator okay you can have 10 more pay-per-view money and he tweeted this choose your fighter he can even bring his bear elona then said and um we should form a book club posting this dostoyevsky quote a fool with the heart and no mind is just as unfortunate a fool as a fool with a mind without a heart eva fox tweeted reality of russian people in power for a limited ordinary person for example there's nothing easier than to imagine oneself as an extraordinary and original person and enjoy it without any hesitation again a quote from dostoyevsky elon then tweeted out this picture and sir doge of the koina said four stages of reading russian classics which elon said was right on the mark okay so okay so let's unpack that let's slow down so first of all elon wants to fight putin for the ukraine in hand-to-hand combat are we talking about i mean he looks he can bring his uh flame flamethrower okay now i mean a lot of people have done some analysis elon is a younger guy he's also a caller right so he's got 20 years on vladimir right now i mean we have seen vladimir putin riding a bear before well and vlad knows judo right he was in the kgb i don't know elon's got a kind of a bad back well that's because he that's because he took out a sumo wrestler true which is a point in elon's category true i mean is so but let's just let's just is this a joke i mean this is clearly a joke it's clearly a joke really gonna but we're gonna see and a couple more tweets that it led to some more stuff anyway let's take a break from this for a second and teslarati tweeted out elon musk's starlink was ukraine's most downloaded app last sunday and then elon tweeted out of course starlink another poke at russia and then came this a telegram post by ramzan kharov the head of the chechen republic and um just if you're who is ramzan he has once said that my idol is vladimir putin so i mean this is a general who loves putin okay and he tweeted this out elon musk a word of advice don't measure your strength against that of putin's you're in two completely different leagues and it's not even about martial arts or judo for example how do you see it are you in the red corner of the boxing ring a businessman and twitter user and putin in blue a world politician and strategist who inspires awe in the west and in the us vladimir will look unsportsmanlike when he beats the hell out of you a much weaker opponent therefore you'll need to pump up those muscles in order to change from the gentle effeminate alona into the brutal elon you need to be i propose training at one of several centers in the chechen republic russian special forces university here you will undergo firearms training with world championship special forces who beat us special forces in 2015 it was nothing the ahmat fight club this is where you'll be trained to take a punch equality needed in any fight under the guidance of abu zayed vismuradov you will learn to quickly pull yourself up not just physically but also mentally giving you nerves of steel and grasny chechen state television and radio broadcasting company practice within the walls of grozny where they will tell you about american methods of black pr and teach you how to monitor and update social network accounts you will return from the czech republic a completely different person ilona that is elon elon then responded thank you for the offer but such excellent training would give me too much of an advantage if he is afraid to fight i will agree to use only my left hand and i'm not even left-handed ashley vance tweeted out i'm prepared to produce this reality show elon's chechen adventure just say the word all right so that's where we're at with that and um what i don't this is with the sec by the way policing his tweets i mean it's not it doesn't sound very gonna happen i hope not i don't think i mean chechen republic is still in russia i just want to point out this would be a way for um vladimir to save face he could look at this and go yeah i can take him right and then but let's say he beats elon but then he'd be able the stakes are ukraine so i mean yes but that's just um him and elon agreeing to that elon elon can't control that so true you know then vladimir could go back to russia and be well i should have taken ukraine but you know elon reneged on the deal you know i don't know i think it's just it's so goofy to me it's just kind of i don't know a lot of people have been saying elon stopped making such light of this because it sounds he's making light of it i think that he is actually serious not that going to to the training camps or whatever i mean we got plenty of fine enough training camps here whatever if you're going to go fight vladimir putin um if this doesn't get you inside the mind of elon though i don't know what does i mean him being able to tweet what he's actually i mean it's just about crazy enough for it to work i'm sure but did you ever think a week ago that this would be a tweet thread no it's crazy it's crazy i don't i don't know if i it i hear you i'm just elon you're already doing a lot right you don't stay in your lane so to speak you don't have to fight putin in a i don't know all right well let's end on a lighter note here holmar's catalog tweeted out in january green hills software proudly announced that the bmw ix would use their tech but read closely and you'll notice the bmw didn't use their tech at all some of bmw's tier one suppliers mobileye did and now bmw is dumping mobileye and green hill software with them suddenly it makes sense why dan o'dowd is getting so upset and funding a smear campaign doesn't it they're losing customers left and right as oems realize they need to step up their game to compete with tesla the same broken tech won't get them where they're going within three years they'll switch over elona said they have no idea how hard fsd is only path to success in my opinion is hardcore real world ai software with dedicated neural net inference acceleration acics in car multi-billion dollar neural net training super cluster and 10 plus billion miles of vehicle data good luck i mean i think that this is some pretty good twitter sleuthing by um hallmark's catalog here i mean yeah this this whole green hills thing i haven't considered it to be that big a deal i haven't noticed people talking about it in my everyday life but i'd love to know what other people are hearing um it is just funny that someone would take out an ad it's weird it is really funny it shows you how their minds work where um same thing with big oil big auto when you're losing instead of going you know what let's completely revamp let's pivot let's go to the best technology you go let's just can we fight them uh and then lastly world of engineering tweeted out space fact on venus it's nose metal and rain sulfuric acid and elon said hardcore i don't know if that's exactly true i mean if you remember there's we landed spacecraft on venus which only lasted i think an hour or two before it was disintegrated and i don't know that it i mean i guess technically it snows metal um i don't know that it rains sulfuric acid i think you're thinking of clouds of rain it's there's light precipitation in the air and that is an acid so just you know i mean we could still maybe live there it's hardcore it is hardcore and i don't i don't want to live on venus there's that kyrgyzstan where they're actually we shouldn't live on mars we should live on venus and we'll here's what we'll have some mass drivers and they'll be able to take stuff from the moons of jupiter and throw stuff to i'm what i don't know has anyone else watched that and just been what the hell are you talking about isn't it easier to i don't know maybe some smarter people in the comment section can tell me isn't it easier to live on mars and then terraform mars than it is to terraform venus maybe i didn't watch the correctly but that's the sense that i got from that weird anyway what a weird week in elon tweets this has been thank you for joining us i'm really glad that we can bring you the show now uh outside of ttn i think it does have a life of its own because there is so much to talk about if we had just tweeted this out this week i would have felt there's so much to unpack there so thank you so much to our patreon supporters for making this possible um because yeah we wouldn't have had the editing power to be able to do this without the support of our patrons and if you're wondering about the shirt i'm wearing go back to watch her in depth where we drove with steven in full self driving and uh you'll find out why we'll see you next time now you know,0
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJk5LoqD3j1n9XDvKWGz7oS-,7s8R-2Qg0SM,hey i'm zack and i'm jesse welcome to our series on elon the disruptor we're always so busy on this reporting on ilan's incredible enterprises these past few years that we realized we sometimes lose sight of the big picture so we're going to show you how elan could very well be the biggest disruptor in human history [music] i think there are many reasons why we can't see all the disruptions that elon is heading up today the first is that we are in the middle of them most of us have never reflected on what it feels to be in the middle of a disruption even though many of us have actually lived through a few if you're thirty years or older then you may remember that to call a friend used to involve this until about 1985 whenever you made a phone call you were attached to a physical wire and you could never stray far from it no matter how hard you try this hard wired telephone technology was patented in 1876 so it was the dominant technology for over a hundred years people had been born with a wired phone in their house people had grown up with wired phones and people had died knowing nothing but wired phones then along came the wireless phone in the early 1990s and it was a game-changer remember you could walk around the house around the office in fact you can even walk aways out of your house and still be on the phone and then in the late 1990s we started seeing people walk around with these things yes they were big yes they were expensive but they were a mobile phone and that made them sought-after i mean you could literally walk anywhere and communicate with anyone sure not everyone had them in the 1990s but by the year 2000 most of us did they weren't smart yet but these cell phones were a disruption they disrupted the old landline phone here's a chart of cell phone sales take a look at how it took off within a few short years cell phones displaced their traditional landline telephone market the old technology was replaced now are their landlines still around today yes are there still some rotary dial telephones yes a disruption doesn't mean that the old technology is necessarily completely gone entirely but it does mean that the majority of people have moved on to the new technology leaving the old technology pretty much to collector shelves and yard sale bargains you see if you're at least 30 years old then you know what this cell phone disruption feels now that we are completely unattached the wall now that most of us have cell phones we can start to see new possibilities that just didn't occur to most of us when we were attached to our walls only a very small number of people have the imagination to see what the world could look and even a smaller number of people can see that future possibility and make it into a reality the second problem most of us have seeing all the disruptions that ilan is making happen is that most people don't see anything much happening you might notice a supercharger location got installed nearby you might remember seeing a red roadster launched into space you might have seen something about a boring tunnel party but these don't affect your everyday life because let's face it there are still gas stations they're still traffic so what are all these disruptions we're talking about so going back to the cell phone analogy when you first started noticing business people walking around with their blocky expensive cell phones how did that affect your daily life it didn't your life didn't change you didn't have one of those new mobile phones you still had to find a phone booth to make your calls when you were away from the office but your life was about to change a few years later you would get a cell phone your life was about to be disrupted you just didn't know it yet and the third problem was seeing all the disruptions that elan is causing as well it just doesn't seem possible it just seems strange we humans are practical creatures we base our thinking and our decisions on our own experiences i mean that's how we learn after all we experience something and then we commit it to memory and then later we draw on that memory to decide what to do about something new we face for instance what did you learn from the last time you needed to buy an automobile you probably went to your local car dealer the things that elon musk is talking about don't make sense with the reality we know i mean he's telling us to buy his cars online no more dealers and his cars don't use gas or diesel they have batteries that get powered by electricity you may have never experienced this before so that sounds strange staying away from strange things has largely protected us humans for thousands of years those berries look strange i'm not going to eat them staying away from strange things has historically been the safest option go with the tried and true and you can't go wrong right i guess but how did that work out for countless companies that stayed away from the strange in this series we're going to deep dive into the industries that ilan is currently disrupting and show how big that disruption will be we'll show you how big and how important these disruptions are and how they will affect everyone on the planet i hope you'll join us thanks for watching now you know thanks so much

Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJk5LoqD3j1n9XDvKWGz7oS-,0LeYoE7xPxQ,hey i'm zack and i'm jesse in this episode we'll show you how ellen's first disruption is already well underway and how you are being affected by it do you even know what it is [music] do you know what this is yeah it's a checkbook up until the year 2000 it was about the only way other than cash to transfer money from one person to another in fact cheques became a big part of our culture working paycheck to paycheck be careful he doesn't write a bad check your checks in the mail even today when you go to a bank and set up a new account you usually have the choice between a savings and yeah you guessed it a checking account yet this simple piece of paper was an important innovation because it meant that you didn't need to load up a carriage with bags and bags of coins and drive them hundreds of miles to transfer money from one person or business to another all of a sudden a simple piece of paper would do the trick so much easier so much faster so much cheaper so much safer now that's innovation so wait let me get this straight throughout human history there were only a couple disruptions that changed how people moved wealth right there was the first disruption when humans went from bartering goods to a system of money yeah everything from gold coins iron sticks wampum anything that represents value and could be traded in exchanged for goods and services yep and that lasted for centuries until a system of checking developed so that people could transfer this wealth over vast distances easily and securely the next innovation occurred in 1999 when elon musk co-founded a startup called xcom with the idea of being able to email money how is this an innovation order wire transfers yeah you could walk down to a western union office for instance and transfer money but it was expensive and time-consuming what about credit cards were you really gonna share your credit card information with strangers on the internet in 1999 wait so how did you buy stuff on ebay back then sooo think about this for a second in 1999 people were using email to send messages elon had the idea to use email to send more than just words he wanted to use email to send money between people oh i get it this made it a lot less scary to send money because all you were doing was sharing your email address not your banking information right and in 2000 xcom merged with co finity which owned paypal and elon became the ceo of paypal elon was the biggest shareholder in paypal when it got bought by ebay in 2002 elon went on to use the millions of dollars he received from the sale of paypal to fund his future companies have you figured out the first of ilan's disruptions that you are affected by today paypal was the first way most people safely paid for things on the internet elon disrupted global banking his idea a deceivingly simple one the ability to transfer money over the internet disrupted the world of banking and established a new industry ecommerce for without the ability to safely and quickly send money between people and businesses how would i bey have ever worked and let's be honest ebay was the gateway for many people to experience internet commerce ecommerce for the first time to show people that it could work to buy a beanie baby from a guy's garage in ohio and transmit money instantly from an account thousands of miles away into his bank account with no risk once people experienced this they were hooked ecommerce took off mail-order catalogs started dying in the idea of driving to brick-and-mortar stores lost much of its appeal in 1999 when elon got this idea ecommerce sales in the us for 15 billion dollars less than 1% of retail sales in the u.s. today more than 14 percent of all us retail sales take place online with over 500 billion dollars in sales think about how ecommerce has changed everything for better or for worse it has changed the landscape of our world it has enabled businesses to pop up anywhere and everywhere amazon is the largest online retailer with almost 50 percent market share but over half of their sales come from third-party sellers over 1.7 million individual sellers around the world many of which have no physical storefront at all just an internet connection a computer in an entrepreneurial spirit banks have had to adapt because of ellen's disruptive idea would you open an account with a bank today if they didn't at least offer online access to your account many banks today offer services direct deposit electronic bill pay electronic transfers checking your balance on a smartphone heck now you can even deposit a physical check with a smartphone just by taking a picture of it and now there are banks that have no physical presence at all no human tellers no brick-and-mortar branches the banking system has been disrupted but don't take our word for it at your next office meeting or dinner party ask how many people use paypal instead of writing checks or going to the atm to take out cash but wait a minute people my age don't use paypal anymore we use venmo good point venmo is super easy to use right on your phone and that's why paypal bottom oh so i'm not using my email address but i'm still moving money over the internet on paypal's platform which is just an extension of ilan's original idea the global banking industry in 2018 comprised over half a million businesses employed over 10 million people and had revenue of 2 trillion dollars that entire industry has changed how it does business now in part because of an idea that elon musk had 20 years ago a two trillion dollar industry disrupted by one of ilan's first companies and we're just getting started i hope you'll join us on our next episode of elon the disruptor thanks for watching now you know [music] thanks so much for watching now you know we work hard to bring you videos about things that we think you'll find useful but we

Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJk5LoqD3j1n9XDvKWGz7oS-,upvH0w5kpfc,"hey i'm zack and i'm jesse in this episode we're gonna be talking about ilan's next big disruption a little company he started in 2002 called spacex [music] the 2001 elon musk had an idea he wanted to land a small green house on mars and regain the public's interest in space exploration he flew to russia and tried to buy some rockets from the russian government but they wouldn't sell him any at a price he could afford so in 2002 with some of the money he had made from selling paypal to ebay ilan started his own rocket company called space exploration technologies corporation spacex by the way before elon started spacex he knew next to nothing about rockets elon took a look at the rocket industry and realized they were wasting a lot of money he decided to apply vertical integration and bring production of 85% of launch hardware in-house he wanted to cut the cost to launch a rocket by a factor of 10 and still have a huge profit on every lunch as elon has explained many times if every time you took an airline flight everyone had to jump out of the plane and parachute to the destination and then the plane crashed a plane ticket would cost well over a million dollars it seems obvious of course you have to reuse the airplane for elon to achieve inexpensive rocket flights he'd have to reuse the first stage of the rocket in 2008 just six years after starting spacex was the first privately owned company to launch a liquid-fueled rocket into orbit think about that for a second six years after starting to make something he didn't even know that much about ellen's fledgling company did something no private company had ever done before and on december 22nd 2015 spacex was the first to land an orbital rockets first stage back on land the falcon 9 had just done the impossible the rocket industry would never be the same again it had just been disrupted an industry full of huge global defense titans lockheed martin and boeing which partnered in two united launch alliance or ula they have been building rockets for decades and they just got schooled spacex this upstart company with just about 5,000 employees in 2015 went up against lockheed martin with a hundred thousand employees and which had 161,000 those big companies weren't even attempting to do it spacex did well landing a rocket that's impossible and then five months after spacex accomplished the impossible they went on to do something even more impossible on april 8th 2016 they landed a rocket on a drone ship on the ocean [applause] and it didn't stop there spacex just kept making landmark achievements doing things that had never been done before the first privately funded liquid-fueled rocket to reach orbit the first privately developed liquid fuel rocket to put a commercial satellite in orbit the first private company to successfully launch orbit and recover spacecraft the first private company to send a spacecraft to the international space station the first company to send a satellite into geosynchronous orbit the first landing of an orbital rockets first stage on land the first landing of an orbital rockets first stage on an ocean platform the first relaunch and landing of a used orbital rocket stage the first controlled flyback and recovery of a payload fairing the first reef light of a commercial cargo spacecraft the first private company to send a human-rated spacecraft to space the first private company to autonomously dock a spacecraft to the international space station not to mention the successful launch of the falcon heavy in february of 2018 the world's most powerful rocket in operation that put a tesla roadster into space as of today spacex has had over 80 completed missions and has over 100 upcoming launches on its manifest worth over 12 billion dollars okay so this is a nice story about the success of spacex but you might be asking what does this have to do with disruption yeah surely the big boys boeing and lockheed martin are still launching plenty of rockets and making plenty of money this little company spacex is so tiny compared to them you even said it yourself spacex is a fraction of their employees and i mean spacex is only valued at about 30 billion dollars yeah lockheed martin is valued at 109 billion and boeing is valued at 202 billion right so where's the disruption well spacex has claimed that they can launch a rocket for ninety million dollars whereas the same mission would cost ula 225 to 445 million dollars that's because ula uses the expendable atlas five and delta for launch systems that have been in use for more than 50 years wait they've been basically using the same rocket since the 60s yep these are expendable rocket platforms which means that the first stage of the rocket never recovered so ula along with russia's gross cosmos space agency and the european orion rocket agency all use expendable launch platforms yep and for decades they've pretty much been the only game in town the us military nasa and private satellite companies had no choice but to use them and pay their price so they have not been innovating as quickly as spacex and here's a chart of rocket launches do you see a trend see that blue that starts appearing in 2013 that's spacex and in 2018 spacex had 2/3 of the commercial launch market the pace of innovation has been so poor in the launch industry that the only way to get astronauts up to the international space station ever since the space shuttle was retired in 2011 is this this is the russian soyuz crew module from the 60s it's the only way to get astronauts from any country into orbit but as we speak spacex is testing their dragon crew module which has already transported cargo safely to the iss and soon will also carry astronauts boeing is also developing a crew module but a seat aboard their starliner capsule will cost 90 million dollars versus spacex is 55 million aboard crew dragon every year about 200 satellites are launched into orbit currently the worldwide rocket propulsion market is valued at about 5 billion dollars as spacex is able to lower the price per kilogram to orbit more companies can afford to launch which expands the market market which spacex currently controls that's called disruption we hope you'll join us for our next episode

Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJk5LoqD3j1n9XDvKWGz7oS-,fO0RKGd6gDo,"hey i'm zack and i'm jesse in this episode we're gonna be talking about a company that is synonymous with elon musk tesla but the disruption we're going to be talking about may not be the one you'd expect [music] you see when i think of tesla i think of amazing electric cars but tesla is so much more than an electric car company there's a product they make that contributes just a small amount to their balance sheet but is making waves in a big industry the building block of this product is rather small in fact it can fit in your pocket put a bunch of these together into a pack and you get this the tesla powerwall - first introduced in 2016 stores 13.5 kilowatt hours of energy today there are tens of thousands of power walls installed at more than 50,000 sites around the world a power wall will keep your homes electricity running even when a blackout hits and you can store power in a tesla powerwall when electricity is cheaper at night or from your home solar system and then sell it back to the grid when the demand is higher this not only saves you money but help stabilize the grid and speaking of utility grids add a few more batteries okay a lot more batteries and you get this the tesla power pack the tesla power pack can store 210 kilowatt hours of energy perfect for projects college campuses hospitals and other large buildings and now tesla is starting to install them at tesla superchargers to store solar energy and tesla didn't stop there they kept innovating and earlier this year unveiled the tesla mega pack each pack holds three megawatt hours of energy and they can be linked together for up to one gigawatt hour of grid scale energy storage that's enough to power every home in san francisco for six hours this helps utilities to store electricity when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing and feed the grid when it isn't each tesla mega pack has a 60 percent greater energy density compared to the power pack released just two years earlier tesla just keeps innovating and if you're thinking that this is just a cute idea that only works on paper think again in 2017 tesla installed the world's largest battery project a hundred and twenty nine megawatt hours of tesla power pack batteries to store the power from these 99 wind generators at the horns tail wind farm in south australia it's been operating flawlessly since it opened stabilizing the grid and lowering the cost of electricity for the average rate payer ever since many people thought it could never work but it did you see normally utilities have to rely on what are called peaker plants usually powered by coal or natural gas to quickly turn on and feed power to the grid when there are periods of high demand for instance when it gets hot and everyone starts turning on their air conditioners the problem is utilities have to build these expensive peaker plants and have them sit idle for much of the time when demand isn't at its peak yeah most peaker plants sit idle 80% of the time and who pays for those plants to be built maintained and staffed the ratepayers you and i the tesla horn steel battery storage project was the first time that battery storage was used on this scale over 4,000 households rely on it every day to do what the peaker plants used to do except batteries can do it better first of all batteries are cheaper than building an expensive peaker plant yeah the horn steel battery project cost 67 million dollars compared to an average gas-powered peaker plant that costs around 700 million dollars battery storage projects are also faster to build than gas or coal power plants even though horns dale was tesla's first really big battery project they built it within three months compare that to a gas peaker plant that can take six or seven years to complete and the batteries don't emit any pollution the horn stale batteries get their power from clean wind turbines so there's absolutely no carbon dioxide where other air pollution created natural gas power plants on the other hand emit carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide pollution nitrogen oxide gases react to form smog and acid rain as well as being central to the formation of fine particles in ground-level ozone both of which are associated with adverse health effects and coal power plants emit mercury cadmium lead and other toxic heavy metals along with sulfur dioxide nitrogen dioxides vocs arsenic carbon monoxide soot in part chicklet matter pm 2.5 not to mention co2 as well and batteries do their job fast super fast when thousands of people all call for power at the same time when everyone gets home from work or turns on their air conditioners batteries can respond within milliseconds to feed power to the grid so that nobody notices any spikes or sags but traditional peaker plants can take up to 20 minutes to fully ramp up and in the mean time the grid can experience brownouts sags and blackouts but possibly even more amazing than all that is that the tesla horn snail battery project has almost paid for itself you might be asking how did this project that cost 67 million dollars almost pay for itself it's only been 2 years since it was built what does grow money it's true the horn cell battery project doesn't grow money but it saves ratepayers money you see every time utility has to fire up a peeker plant it can charge the grid quite a bit of money because not only is it expensive to turn on but well the grid has no choice if customers are demanding power it has to supply that electricity demand even if they only need a couple seconds of peak power they get charged by the 15 minute period in over multiple short lags during a day that can add up to tens of thousands of dollars now multiply that by hundreds of days and you get millions of dollars charge to ratepayers every year millions of dollars saved by a battery that can easily supply those short and long grid sags because that's what batteries are good at and it's not just happening in south australia grid scale battery storage makes sense in lots of places and that's why as we speak a growing number of big battery storage projects are being built around the globe places florida power & lights manatee energy storage center which will store 900 megawatt hours of solar power replacing two natural gas power plants and in oklahoma next era is building the biggest wind plus solar plus storage project in the united states which when completed will have 800 megawatt hours of battery storage and tesla is helping build another giant battery 700 and megawatt-hours along california's central coast at moss landing as more utilities learn that batteries actually can do this job cheaper cleaner and faster they are clamoring for battery storage the global distributed electric power market is valued at almost 100 billion dollars do you see what's happening we are in the middle of another disruption a disruption to the global energy grid industry another disruption to another multibillion-dollar industry but we haven't even gotten started or should i say elon hasn't even gotten started yet will show you another elon disruption on the next episode thanks for watching now you know [music] thanks so much for watching now you know we work hard to bring you videos about things that we think you'll find useful but we need to know from you what you want to see so leave your comments below also don't forget to go over to our patreon page where for as little as a buck a month you can

Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJk5LoqD3j1n9XDvKWGz7oS-,osR4_6Xh2Pc,"hey i'm zack and i'm jesse in the last episode we talked about the disruption caused by the tesla powerwall and power pack in this episode tesla does some more disrupting but again it might not be exactly the disruption you were thinking about [music] if you're watching this series then you know that tesla sells cars by next year tesla will have over 1 million of its amazing electric cars on the road throughout the world how does tesla get those cars into the driveways and garages of its customers tesla does it differently than every other big auto manufacturer when henry ford started making the model t back in 1908 he used a new type of manufacturing to make his cars a factory where the cars move along an assembly line and specialized workers install parts but what happened to all those cars when they were done being built henry ford and other manufacturers tried direct sales to customers through catalogs but customers wanted to have places to get their cars repaired because these cars broke down a lot so auto manufacturers invented the car dealership model often the car makers would own the land and have a franchisee rent the land from them and also take out construction loans from these car makers to build dealerships the franchisees the car dealers this because they had an exclusive right to sell a manufacturer's car models within a certain radius a little monopoly the manufacturers this agreement because it got the cars off their books the dealers were forced to buy the cars immediately from the manufacturer by borrowing from the manufacturer but now that the dealers had the cars on their books they're paying interest on loans to the car makers every month the cars sit on their lots ever wonder why car dealers are so desperate to sell you a car because it's burning a hole in their wallet and did i mention that these cars broke down a lot in fact they were designed to break down by designing the car parts to last just long enough the auto manufacturer not only saved money by using less raw materials but they could then sell parts to the dealerships to fix the cars as they broke in fact this is what made the dealership model work because often the cars are sold to customers with very little profit margin the repairs are the major profit source for the dealership by coming out with new model years to create artificial demand and forcing dealerships to keep buying a certain number of there cars to keep up with their quotas manufacturers had a perfect model that squeezed the dealers and their customers there's a reason car dealers have a bad reputation it's a model built on deception and low quality today just in the united states there are over 16,000 700 franchised auto dealers that sold over 17 million passenger cars last year that's over 1 trillion dollars in new vehicles and those dealers had over three hundred and ten million repair orders last year with service and parts totaling more than a hundred and sixteen billion dollars now along comes elon musk with a disruptive idea what if we sell tesla's without dealers what if customers went online instead and bought tesla's from our website what if we don't make repairs a profit center for our company what if we build a quality car that hardly needs maintenance his idea is so disruptive that auto dealers have used their lobbyists and political weight to pass laws in many us states to keep tesla from selling to you directly why do auto dealers need these anti consumer laws because they want to keep their business model alive once people experience a car that doesn't need endless expensive repairs once people learn about a quick and easy car buying experience they will never look back and the auto dealers notice we are in the middle of another elon disruption elon is disrupting the entire auto dealership industry is it any wonder that auto dealers in almost every state are desperately introducing legislation to slow down or stop tesla's progress the writing is on the wall for this industry as more and more people discover that a tesla means freedom from an antiquated and deceptive sale system the auto dealership wall will crumble another billion-dollar industry disrupted by you guessed it elon musk think about it auto manufacturers started at the turn of the 20th century by selling their cars and catalogues direct to customers but they found a way to make more money and they rode that wave for over a century but we don't need that system we don't buy anything else that way do we and why should we buying directly from tesla means that tesla can start building your car exactly to your specifications when you hit the button they don't have to keep a lot full of colors and options the customers may not want they don't have to pay mortgages on land to store cars every month dealers do and tesla can pass all these savings on to you tesla doesn't have to advertise with endless car commercials because tesla doesn't spend a penny on advertising and who ultimately pays for auto dealership and manufacturer ads you do tesla doesn't have to hustle you with sleazy car salesman because tesla's sell themselves this is definitely another elon disruption we can get behind thanks elon we'll show you another elon disruption on the next episode thanks for watching now you know thanks so much for watching now you know we work hard to bring you videos about things that we think you'll find useful but we need to know from you what you want to see so leave your comments

Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJk5LoqD3j1n9XDvKWGz7oS-,djbdvu4vZwU,"hey i'm zack and i'm jesse whoo we're on episode six of elon the disrupter so far we've shown how elon musk has disrupted banking rockets grid storage and auto dealers but we're still just getting started [music] next up how about the internet wait what how is elon disrupting the internet have you heard of a little subsidiary of spacex called starlink why don't you read from starlings website spacex is developing a low latency broadband internet system to meet the needs of consumers across the globe enabled by a constellation of low-earth orbit satellites star link will provide fast reliable internet to populations with little or no connectivity including those in rural communities and places where existing services are too expensive or unreliable yet a constellation of 4,000 satellites circling the earth giving people broadband internet anywhere and everywhere so no more need for installing cell towers every mile or trenching cables to every city block i mean elon already owns the rocket company right so why not the internet started in the 1960s using telephone lines between major universities military and government buildings when regular people started using it in the late 80s and 90s we were still using phone lines back then we were just sending rudimentary emails and looking at text-based web pages but to get the bandwidth higher so that we could start streaming music and videos companies moved in and started installing cable and fiber optics huge companies comcast at&t and verizon along with almost 60,000 more internet service providers around the world make up a six hundred eighty seven billion dollar industry in many places you only have one choice of service provider if you're lucky maybe you have two or three eelain's starlink will soon be the new kid on the block or should i say the new kid on every block beaming down from space so even if i only have one internet provider in my area i'll suddenly have another options starlink will be available everywhere in the world even if you don't sign up it will probably force your provider to lower your rates just to compete and think of all the people in the world who have no easy access to the internet i mean if you're watching this then you probably have access to high-speed internet but forty-four percent of the world's population does not even in the developed world nineteen percent of people don't starlink maybe the only link those people have to the internet the you and i are lucky enough to surf every day think of the opportunities this will provide think how this will change millions of lives and think of the businesses that will be signing up in droves to use starlink shipping companies that want to keep in touch with their ships at sea and want to give internet access to their crews and passengers airlines that want to offer wi-fi on their airplanes the militaries and governments that want to stay connected around the globe does this sound familiar yep elon just disrupted the internet am i claiming that every other internet provider will disappear once starlink is fully operational no of course not just semi-trucks didn't eliminate railways starlink won't eliminate all internet companies but it will disrupt an industry that has been focused largely on cables and fiber optics for the past half-century i don't know this sounds a little far-fetched i mean even if elon can get four thousand satellites into space that sounds expensive and our poor people in poor country is gonna be able to afford this i've got three words for you high frequency trading high frequency trading is a program trading platform that uses powerful computers to transact a large number of orders in fractions of a second most high-frequency trading firms depend on low latency execution of their trading strategies well what does this have to do with starlink while you and i might feel pretty sophisticated if we trade a few shares of stock in a month in 2016 high frequency trading is estimated to have initiated 10 to 40% of trading volume in stocks that means unimaginable amounts of money is being traded every day using high-frequency trading that relies on taking a piece of news analyzing it with sophisticated software and then sending a buy or sell order to the market before you competition oh ok so thousands of firms will be happy to fork over tons of money to anyone who can deliver fast internet and starlink will offer low latency the fast sub 20 millisecond speeds so financial institutions will be helping to pay for starlink which could potentially bring the internet to anyone in the world they're gonna be so many people thanking elon for this disruption remember a disruption doesn't seem a disruption when you're in the middle of it remember this guy with the giant cell phone it didn't affect you right so who would blame you for thinking that this isn't about to happen but it is about to happen thanks for watching now you know thanks so much for watching now you know we work hard to bring you videos about things that we think you'll find useful but we need to know from you

Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJk5LoqD3j1n9XDvKWGz7oS-,BpA67BMMyJk,hey i'm zack and i'm jesse the beauty of running disruptive companies full of hard-working creative people is that when elon musk has an idea he can make it a reality practically overnight even if it's just a boring one [music] this next disruptive idea came to ilan one day in 2016 as he drove to work in what he calls la's soul destroying traffic why limit ourselves to having roads on a two-dimensional plane shared by pedestrians and bicyclists and buildings why not disappear underground into a three-dimensional tunnel system that could whisk commuters across town quickly why not tunnels come on because tunnels are wicked expensive to build at all today costs 450 million to 1 billion dollars per mile to construct to build just one underground highway system across los angeles would cost hundreds of billions of dollars but that got elon thinking why is building a tunnel so expensive what's more simple than a hole in the ground so what did he do he assigned some employees and interns at spacex to help him do some research into how tunnels are built and what better way to learn than to tinker with a used tunnel boring machine yep i mean it's only chump change for a billionaire so he bought a used tunnel boring machine for a few million and started digging a tunnel across the street from the spacex headquarters in hawthorne california elon was following a play from his own playbook follow first principles ask whether something is physically possible if it is ask why you're not doing it that way and then use existing technology to modify the way the industry currently does something to make it work better and cheaper all current tunnel boring machines are powered by diesel engines eelain's first step was to rip that out and replace it with you guessed it an electric powertrain elon was able to improve the technology right off the bat yeah if you're digging a tunnel without creating diesel fumes you don't have to spend so many resources ventilating the tunnel to get those deadly fumes out and while you're getting rid of diesel engines who needs a diesel-powered muck train for getting rid of the waste make that electric - and why should the waste soil be considered waste why not use the waste to make the concrete walls of the tunnel itself and any extra soil can be made into these bricks which elon is donating for use in low-income housing projects while the rest is sold for profit again looking at a problem differently creates opportunities for cost reductions wire tunnels so wide if you make a tunnel half the width you reduce the amount you have to dig by 75% it's just math highway tunnels today are wide because we humans have to drive through them but if we let the cars drive themselves autonomously they don't need all that extra space on the sides they are perfect computer drivers and if the cars driving through the tunnels are electric instead of ice cars spewing pollution you can spend less on ventilating the finished tunnel and in their first attempt elands new company the boring company built a one-mile test tunnel for only about 10 million dollars sounds a lot but it's actually 50 times cheaper than existing tunnel technology it's actually four to five times cheaper than building a simple one lane surface highway lane and that's their first iteration the boring company has learned a lot in a very short amount of time and is actually working on their third generation electric tunnel boring machine design and they're busy building real-world tunnels as we speak the boring company is building a tunnel system in las vegas for the las vegas convention center and they have another contract with the city of chicago building a tunnel from downtown to o'hare airport and there's the tunnel they're building from washington dc to baltimore maryland so in just a few short years elon musk's boring company has figured out how to build something very popular way cheaper than the competition the tunnel construction market represents six to seven percent of the global infrastructure construction market currently a 19 trillion dollar market right now there are over 1.5 trillion dollars worth of tunnel construction projects they built around the globe and ilan's fledgling boring company can already build tunnels cheaper and faster and this is just the tip of the iceberg considering that the boring company's first iteration already costs 98 percent less than the competition elan should be able to sure much of the tunnel construction market not to mention that once the cost of a tunnel is drastically reduced many more cities and towns will be able to afford them which will vastly increase the tunnel market this is a lot what happened to the computer industry right back in the 1960s only governments and universities could afford computers then in the 80s businesses couldn't do business without them today almost everyone on the planet either has one in their pocket or at least has access to one which has changed life as we know it it'll be the same thing with tunnels today there are a few here and there but in the near future they'll be everywhere and not just running under a river or across town but an underground multi-level network of tunnels which will alleviate traffic and change life in cities unimaginably for more on that check out our boring tunnel future series current tunnel construction companies weren't asking how to build a better tunnel boring machine they were happy to keep making big profits elon isn't interested in starting companies to make big profits he wants to make the world a better place and not just this world these very same boring machines will work on mars for when we establish a new mars colony all of ellen's ideas revolve around this central theme of using first principles to make a better future for all of us again we are in the midst of this new disruption so it may be hard to fathom but the economics and technology are undeniable which means that cheaper faster safer tunnels are inevitable another disruption courtesy of elon musk thanks for joining us now you know thanks so much for watching now you know we work hard to bring you videos about things that we think you'll find useful but we need to know from you what you want to see so leave your comments below also don't forget to go over to our patreon page where for as little as a buck a month you can watch our patreon bonus story every week on tesla time news thanks again we'll see you soon,0
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJk5LoqD3j1n9XDvKWGz7oS-,59xSDpFgk5E,"hey i'm zack and i'm jesse before 2007 if you said electric car nobody thought about anything but this underpowered limited range cars that might be good for the planet but spent more time plugged into the wall than out on the road but that would all change when elon got to work on his first model of electric car the tesla roadster [music] elon musk wants to move the world's transportation from being powered by fossil fuels to vehicles powered by clean renewable energy and he knew that to make electric cars cool he had to make them look and feel the part so his fledgling company took a lotus elise body and married it with a powerful electric powertrain and battery pack to bring the world a sports car that was fast and sexy with a long range and fast charging and the tesla brand was born but let's go back a few steps to a restaurant in los angeles in 2003 elon is having lunch with a smart engineer named jb straubel they're talking about how to move the needle on sustainable transportation they're discussing how to make electric cars with enough range with enough power to interest consumers how to make them cheap enough and how to mass produce them in quantities that would actually have an effect on lowering co2 emissions so they started back of the napkin calculations that led them to conclude that they would have to use existing technologies to power these electric cars electric motors that nikola tesla invented last century and cylindrical lithium-ion laptop batteries that were plentiful but not plentiful enough because each car was gonna need thousands of them to fill each battery pack will need a giga factory to make millions of battery cells billions and will need a way to quickly charge these cars so they can drive anywhere we'll need a network of superchargers fast forward to today and tesla has two giga factories and is the world's largest producer of lithium ion batteries tesla is pumping out over 30,000 cars per month and selling them throughout the world tesla has the supercharger network over 1,600 superchargers the largest evie high powered fast charger network in the world but i hear what you might be saying the global auto industry sells almost a hundred million cars every year it's a three trillion dollar market yeah how can you claim the tesla's disrupting the three trillion dollar auto market tesla will sell only 350,000 cars this year there are over a billion cars in the world but remember how disruptions work adoption of new technologies isn't it follows an s-curve it seems slow at first in fact most people barely notice it's happening at all and then just the cellphone or the television or the refrigerator suddenly everyone has one tesla has made such amazing cars that practically everyone who experiences one wants one and that has forced all the other car manufacturers to listen big auto has tried to ignore this electric car thing for years in fact big auto and big oil has killed off electric cars a couple of times before that's right electric cars were right there in the mix at the very beginning the early car market at the turn of the 20th century was comprised of equal parts electric and internal combustion engine automobiles but big auto and big oil has a way of killing off the competition auto manufacturers want to keep making what they've been making for decades internal combustion engine cars to do anything else would involve retooling rethinking retraining rebranding and that's expensive but when a disruption hits that's the only choice companies either reimagine themselves or they die while global car sales are dropping tesla car sales are rising tesla's are winning all the awards they are the safest cars on the road tesla has the highest brand loyalty and the highest brand ranking cars that get us where we need to go safely cheaply and without polluting our planet and our lungs people want electric cars now because of one person and when the scale tips a bit more and enough of us are filling our cars with sunshine instead of gasoline big oil is going to be disrupted soon they won't be supplying our vehicles with fuel anymore and that's a trillion dollar disruption elon musk is disrupting the global auto market and the fossil fuel industries right before your eyes take a good look take notes because you'll be telling your kids and grandkids about it in a few years this is what a global disruption looks thanks for joining us now you know [music] thanks so much for watching now you know we work hard to bring you videos about things that we think you'll find useful but we need to know from you what you want to see so leave your comments below also don't forget to go over to our patreon page where for as little as a buck a month you can watch our patreon bonus story every week on tesla time news thanks again we'll see you soon",3
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJk5LoqD3j1n9XDvKWGz7oS-,rELngGpOJyg,hey i'm zack and i'm jesse we've seen how tesla is disrupting the auto industry and the oil industry too but there's more to a tesla evie than its battery and motor there's even more disruptive technology [music] after elon musk designed and built the first tesla model s in 2012 he didn't rest on his laurels he and his team got to work on making it so that tesla's can drive themselves tesla's have a suite of sensors including radar ultrasonics gps and cameras that can see the world around them when tesla started working on autonomous driving they relied on a company called mobile id to handle all the software and hardware and mobile i did a great job on autopilot 1.0 but elon wanted his cars to do more than just drive between the lines he wanted tesla's to fully drive themselves and let's just say that mobile i and elon didn't see eye to eye on the time line mobile i thought it would take decades to do what elon wanted to do in just a few years you understand how elon works by now he doesn't to hear that something can't be done especially if there's no physical reason why it can't happen so elon started a team to work on building tesla's own autonomous driving hardware and software at first tesla used gpus from nvidia to power their autonomous driving computer and it worked before long tesla surpassed the capabilities of mobilized system now plenty of other companies way mo and cruz are also working on developing self-driving cars but tesla has two huge advantages data and hardware earlier this year tesla announced that it had developed their own autonomous driving chip and according to industry experts this chip is three to four years ahead of the closest competition in terms of processing power tesla gets tons of data every day from their hundreds of thousands of cars driving around in the world capturing data with all those sensors data that tesla uses to teach neural nets to get smarter about driving the more data the faster you can get to full self-driving cars because you can teach the system about all the weird edge cases in the real world so tesla is years ahead of the competition in terms of computer hardware and driving data with a car that is already very close to being able to fully self drive and if you can get a car that can drive itself safer than a human well then you have just invented something new uber with no human driver you may not believe this can happen i know it's hard to believe but it's happening as we speak every day tesla's are getting better at driving and one day before long they will drive better than human drivers can so imagine the day you can take out your smartphone and request a ride without a human driver it'll be much cheaper than calling an uber today because the human driver costs two-thirds of the fare and electric cars are way cheaper to fuel and maintain than ice cars so add up all the savings and you'll be able to ride in an autonomous tesla robo taxi for a fraction of what you're paying for and uber or lyft today and as we've learned in this series when a technology comes along that provides a service better and cheaper than the current model you get a disruption so most people will choose to use robo taxis versus buying their own automobile and that's a big disruption a destruction that will affect the three trillion dollar auto industry and the multi-billion dollar ride sharing industry it's unbelievable isn't it then one guy elon musk could be the brains behind so many disruptive technologies and we're not even done yet stay tuned for our next episode where we'll show you how tesla will disrupt another industry that you might not expect thanks for watching now you know [music] thanks so much for watching now you know we work hard to bring you videos about things that we think you'll find useful but we need to know from you what you want to see so leave your comments below also don't forget to go over to our patreon page where for as little as a buck a month you can watch our patreon bonus story every week on tesla time news thanks again we'll see you soon,-1
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJk5LoqD3j1n9XDvKWGz7oS-,Z1N6WbrUgkA,hey i'm zack and i'm jesse our tesla car is great they sure are but tesla is more than a car company and there's more disruption coming [music] tesla is now synonymous with amazing electric cars so it's easy to forget that tesla makes more than just electric vehicles and batteries and autonomous driving computers yeah they bought solarcity in 2016 and now they have a whole solar division too and they have a little product called the solar roof tesla unveiled the solar roof in 2016 a roof tile made of glass that has solar photovoltaic panels embedded in it solar roof is designed to look beautiful and protect your roof from the elements while also providing your home with solar energy seems simple enough but it's actually quite an undertaking yeah most homes in the united states are tiled with fiberglass asphalt roofing shingles they're tough they can stand up to the sun and high winds and they're relatively inexpensive and easy to cut and install in fact most asphalt shingle roofs can get installed in just a day or two solar roof has to compete with a proven product and not only be just as good at protecting your roof from the elements but also be affordable and easy to install and that's why three years after being unveiled solar roof has only been installed on a small number of roofs tesla has been busy testing how to improve their solar tile and now they're on their third iteration which they hope will make installations easier and faster and help bring the cost down even more now at this point you might be asking why solar roof tiles why not just be happy with solar panels solar panels are great and they've worked for decades but one of the biggest objections for many considering solar is the way solar panels look i mean i love our traditional solar panels we have to admit this looks fantastic and tesla's solar roof does something that a normal roof can't it makes the homeowner money every day by creating electricity from sunshine a roof that powers the house so elon decided to disrupt another industry yep the roofing industry i know compared to multitrillion-dollar industries big auto and big oil the roofing industry seems tiny but it's actually bigger than you might think did you know that just in the u.s. over five million homes are re-roofed every year and there are another five million new roofs installed annually globally 116 billion dollars worth of roofing materials are installed every year not to mention the hundreds of billions spent on roofing contractor labor roofing is another industry that hasn't evolved much technologically for decades now being disrupted by elan but it doesn't stop there remember tesla has a bunch of other technologies the tesla supercharger network and power pack batteries and solar panels that it builds at the buffalo new york giga factory okay take those and put them together while you're at it put the solar roof and power walls together not sure how you're supposed to put them together okay try this picture a neighborhood of homes all with tesla solar roofs and power walls what does that look a self-powered neighborhood exactly a micro grid homes creating and storing power and sharing it with their neighbors now picture the supercharger network picture a supercharger location with say 12 stalls all covered with solar panels and some power packs to nap try this picture a bunch of big commercial buildings all covered with tesla solar panels and some more power packs what does that look a self powered office park now do you see what tesla is becoming a power utility exactly when you think of a grid scale utility company you probably think of pg&e or con edison or national grid giant utility companies that own giant gas nuclear and coal power plants with fleets of service trucks and power lines running everywhere that's what power utilities used to look elon knows that it's cheaper and better for the environment to get our electricity from the wind and sun and micro grids and power walls protect us from storms that can knock out power lines exactly so who needs power grid monopolies when we can create our own power cheaper elon is disrupting another trillion-dollar global industry a one point four trillion dollar industry but who's counting thanks for watching now you know thanks so much for watching now you know we work hard to bring you videos about things that we think you'll find useful but we need to know from you what you want to see so leave your comments below also don't forget to go over to our patreon page where for as little as a buck a month you can watch our patreon bonus story every week on tesla time news thanks again we'll see you soon,3
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJk5LoqD3j1n9XDvKWGz7oS-,QyGUHKRbOqk,"hey i'm zack and i'm jessie on today's show we're gonna be talking about auto insurance boring hey come back it's not gonna look the same when elon gets through with it [music] this better be good because i've got better things to do than talk about car insurance yeah i agree car insurance is boring but it's another big global industry and it's another one of ilan's disruptions okay yeah you're right auto insurance is a big industry it's a 200 billion dollar worldwide market but how is it lawn disrupting well as we've been reporting on tesla time news tesla is now offering tesla auto insurance to its customers in california okay so tesla has decided to start an insurance company arthur hundreds of auto insurance companies according to the national association of insurance commissioners as of 2017 just in the u.s. there are over 2,500 property and casualty insurance companies how does tesla starting an insurance company disrupt the industry how do insurance companies make money they collect premiums from policyholders and what are their expenses whatever they have to pay out and claims right and whatever money they've collected that they don't pay out they get to keep and invest right right so how do insurance companies accurately predict ahead of time how many accidents there will be every year they look at past crash data statistics and they extrapolate educated guesses basically right and the better the data the better the guess right right so wait tesla knows everything about their cars they know how fast they're driven they know when there's a crash event they even know when they changed lanes you got it just how tesla is king of data for autonomous driving development that same data is super important for calculating auto insurance so you're saying that when i get auto insurance quotes from different companies they're basically making an educated guess about the chances that i'll get into an accident and then calculating a premium that should make them profitable right and what are auto insurance companies basing that guess on now all they have to go on now is my age my driving record where i live and what kind of car i drive i guess yep they plug all those things into an algorithm and it spits out a premium for you but what is it missing it doesn't know if i'm a cautious dry or a reckless driver right but tesla would they could raise your premium if they saw that you were driving recklessly hey i don't want to pay higher premiums neither do i but at the moment everyone who pays for auto insurance has to pay more for each reckless driver what if reckless and careless drivers paid for themselves and the rest of us could have lower auto insurance premiums but insurance companies already take into account crashes and they would raise my premiums if i got into a crash but currently insurance companies only know about a crash if it gets reported the national highway traffic safety administration estimates that about 10 million crashes go unreported each and every year that's a lot of missing data and that's just the united states and what are two of the biggest expenses for auto insurance companies after payouts i'm guessing advertising is one of them yep us property and casualty insurance companies spent more than six billion dollars on advertising in 2015 geico alone spent 1.3 billion on that gecko and they must also spend a lot on claims adjusters and accident investigators to figure out who is at fault and how much damage was done but tesla has sensors and cameras all around their cars so figuring out what happened after an accident is far easier faster and cheaper for tesla in most cases tesla wouldn't have to send out anyone to the scene because they'd already have the data there's the data again and don't forget that tesla understands how much safer autopilot is it's current data shows that driving an autopilot leads to eight times fewer accidents so tesla insurance can offer lower premiums for drivers that drive an autopilot right and lower premiums will attract more customers and according to jd power 78% of people bundle their insurance so if tesla wanted to start offering home insurance renter's insurance health insurance and life insurance they could grow their existing customer base into more insurance products exactly and the global insurance industry is a multi trillion dollar industry there elon goes again disrupting a trillion industry thanks for watching now you know thanks so much for watching now you know we work hard to bring you videos about things that we think you'll find useful but we need to know from you what you want to see so leave your comments below also don't forget to go over to our patreon page where for as little as a buck a month you can watch our patreon bonus story every week on tesla time news thanks again we'll see you soon",3
Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJk5LoqD3j1n9XDvKWGz7oS-,Xx4sDyvyU4Q,"hey i'm zack and i'm jesse we were almost done writing the series on ilan's disruptions when elon musk went and did it again he unveiled a new product that's deceptively disruptive [music] the tehsil cyber truck unveiled in november of 2019 love its design or hate it you can't deny that its specs it's looks are truly astounding an all-electric pickup truck with a payload of 3,500 pounds and a base price of thirty nine thousand nine hundred dollars the competition can't touch even these basic numbers and consumers know it that's why tesla had over 250,000 pre-orders within five days of the unveiling those pre-order numbers are similar to the model three pre-order numbers and look where the model three is today yeah it's the number one selling electric car in the world but the cyber truck isn't just an electric pickup truck it has so many more features and innovations that we argue it's actually an entirely new class of vehicle just the japanese sub compacts in the late 70s the minivan in the early 80s or the jeep wrangler in the late 80s the cyber truck is not just a pickup truck sure it has a bed all pickup trucks have but this six and a half foot bed has a stainless steel tonneau cover that can close over it to protect its contents making the bed into what tesla calls the vault and within this vault tesla has designed new features l slots and t slots which owners can configure with tie-downs jigs and racks any way they want tesla also just announced that the tailgate will have a flip stop feature to allow the truck to carry full 4x8 sheets sheetrock and plywood and tesla has even announced that there'll be a solar panel cover option that will be able to charge the truck 15 miles a day and how about this nifty camper option making this a complete adventure vacation vehicle and it can tow heavy loads pickup trucks can the base cyber truck can tow up to 7,500 pounds but the cyber truck can do so much more first of all it seats six adults comfortably did we mention it's made of a stainless steel exoskeleton that means it isn't built using a traditional frame and body construction the three millimeter cold rolled stainless steel is tough it's sledgehammer proof and bulletproof what other pickup truck has that feature not only is a dent proof it won't rust mamie another pickup truck that won't rust and all tesla's the cyber truck will have full self driving hardware and software again a feature that no other pickup truck offers and it has built in 110 and 220 volt outlets so you can plug anything into it from an electric saw to another evie that's right if you want to charge up your friends model 3 you can just plug it into the cyber truck what other pickup can do that the cyber truck is adaptive air suspension which means not only can it lower and raise itself four inches but the built-in air compressor is also available for air tools yeah that's right you can just plug in your pneumatic nail gun and start working and the air suspension allows the cyber truck to lower its rear four inches and raise its nose four inches making it easier to get things in and out of the bed you know what makes it even easier to get stuff into the bed this yeah that's a built in ramp [music] and with 16 inches of ground clearance it's a beast of an off-road vehicle and we've just been talking about the features that the base model has move up to the duel or try motor models and you get all-wheel drive insane zero to sixty times and towing capacities up to 14,000 pounds but let's not forget that the cyber truck is all electric that means low maintenance low electric charging costs and zero tailpipe emissions for businesses it's a no brainer need a people mover check need a truck that can carry loads and tow check you need a snow plow check need a vehicle that's gonna save you money from day one check and because it's a tesla it can supercharge meaning it can recharge in just minutes anywhere you find yourself around the world but one of the most innovative aspects of the cyber truck is its design it is designed by folding flat sheets of stainless steel origami into the structure of the vehicle this way of making a vehicle eliminates needing giant multi-story high stamping machines because you can't stamp three millimeter 300x cold rolled stainless steel it's so hard it would break the stamping machine the added weight of the thicker steel is offset by the lack of a subframe and what you get instead is an indestructible vehicle now why hasn't this been done before you might ask because as we've talked about in episode five manufacturers and auto dealers alike benefit from selling you parts and service big auto doesn't want to sell you a vehicle that lasts forever they want to sell you parts and service forever that's one of their biggest profit centers and don't think this is a one-off the delorean the cyber truck design is just the beginning tesla is going to be able to make any car they want out of this architecture from delivery vans to sports cars electric vehicles that will be virtually indestructible cheaper to make and maintain wonder why elon is doing this that's right autonomous cars back in episode 9 we discussed how autonomous cars are going to disrupt everything we know about transportation it is tesla prepares for our autonomous driving future they need vehicles that can stand up to the abuse of being used 24/7 365 days a year for over a decade without wearing out and the cyber truck and the similarly designed models that will follow all fit that bill non-stop innovation that's what elands brain does and he's not done yet and neither are we find out what other disruptions ilan's got in store in our next episode thank you for joining us now you know thanks so much for watching now you know we work hard to bring you videos about things that we think you'll find useful but we need to know from you what

Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJk5LoqD3j1n9XDvKWGz7oS-,eIajx0skkJc,"hey i'm zack and i'm jesse you know we're over a dozen episodes into this series and ilan still got a bunch of disruptions up the sleeve we better pack all the rest into this episode or we'll never finish [music] we talked about so many of ilan's disruptive companies i forget have we discussed neuro-link yet that's right i forgot about neuro-link corporation that's the company elon founded in 2016 to develop a brain machine interface sound so much science fiction elon says he actually got the idea from a science-fiction novel the culture series of books by ian and banks it's just incredible that in such a short amount of time neural inc has developed the n wan module that wirelessly sends information from over 3,000 electrodes attached robotically to a patient's brain using threads that are one-tenth the cross section of a human hair elon wants to develop this technology not only to help people with spinal cord injuries and other brain disorders but because he doesn't want us to become housecats you see as artificial intelligence gets smarter there's just no denying that humans are going to get left behind if we can't interface with computers that are getting faster and faster are we really just gonna keep typing and speaking as a way to input information it's painfully slow compared to how fast we can think with neural inc humans will have a much faster way to interface with computers which will give us superhuman powers of intelligence to keep up with supercomputers that are surpassing us in terms of computational speed and speaking of ai elon founded the nonprofit open ai in 2015 in fact it shares office space with neural inc opening eyes purpose is to develop artificial intelligence openly so that no one entity controls artificial intelligence as computer intelligence gets smarter every year that will come a day probably around 2045 according to futurist ray kurzweil called the singularity when computer intelligence will surpass human intelligence talk about a disruption to all humans this philosophy behind opening ai is that we should be developing artificial intelligence that helps humans because i'm sure by now you can imagine there are plenty of people and companies in the world that are using artificial intelligence for own profit yeah there have already been national elections whose outcomes were affected by artificial intelligence algorithms just because most of us don't understand ai doesn't mean that ai isn't a threat elon has put it very succinctly the biggest issue i see with so-called ai experts is they think they know more than they do and they think they are smarter than they actually are this tends to plague smart people they define themselves by their intelligence and they don't the idea that a machine could be way smarter than them so they discount the idea which is fundamentally flawed he goes on i am really quite close i am very close to the cutting edge in ai and it scares the hell out of me it's capable of vastly more than almost anyone knows and the rate of improvement is exponential and mark my words ai is far more dangerous than nukes far so why do we have no regulatory oversight this is insane ai is a rare case where i think we need to be proactive in regulation than be reactive and so since elon knows we probably won't regulate ai through normal government policy he is trying to mitigate the risk with open ai if all of us have access to ai at least one of us can't monopolize its use on humanity this next disruption seems another technology you'd only find in science fiction hyperloop elon publicly mentioned it in 2012 and published a white paper about it in 2013 hyperloop is an electrically powered sealed system of vacuum tubes through which a pod carrying passengers and cargo can travel without friction allowing for incredibly fast speeds in 2015 elon built a one kilometer test hyperloop tunnel outside of spacex where he invites teams from around the world to compete every year in testing their pod propulsion prototypes in just the first four years of competition teams have gotten their test pod speeds up to 287 miles an hour and elon proposes that speeds faster than modern passenger jets can be achieved imagine traveling safely from la to san francisco for instance at speeds of 760 miles per hour you'd make the trip in just 35 minutes while elon may not have started a hyperloop company he inspired others who did currently there are over half a dozen companies working on developing the technology that didn't exist before companies virgin hyperloop one today have contracts to build hyperloop systems this one from the city center of pune to mumbai international airport which regularly takes over three hours with hyperloop just 25 minutes and if that isn't fast enough for you how about hopping on a rocket and flying to the other side of the globe at 27,000 kilometers an hour yeah i know science fiction right run elon is building and testing starship as we speak now that he's figured out how to land a rocket what's so crazy about it it's just as crazy as it must have seemed to people at the turn of the last century for people to fly across the ocean in a shiny to hop on a starship in new york and arrived in tokyo about 37 minutes later and according to elon the cost per seat should be about the same as full fare economy in an aircraft sound disruptive and how about this for a finale elon will be launching his starship rocket to the moon and mars to establish moon and mars colonies in the next decade ilan's rocket innovations including the landing of rockets and the reuse of them will reduce the cost of interplanetary travel dramatically the u.s. landed six manned spacecraft on the moon between 1969 and 1972 at a cost in today's dollars of two hundred and eighty 8.1 billion dollars that's 48 billion per mission elon estimates he'll be able to launch a manned mission for only two million that's 24 thousand times cheaper the innovations in rocket technology that elon has been able to achieve in such a short amount of time is simply astounding now while these past five innovations that we've discussed haven't been fully realized yet they are more than just blueprints drawing board all of them are actively being developed by some of the brightest minds in the world and all of them are proven to work and in all of their respective fields they are the most disruptive technologies in our final episode of this series we will try to put all of

Now You Know,PLDn5j59RTWJk5LoqD3j1n9XDvKWGz7oS-,ZfkOftkDNCw,hey i'm zack and i'm jessie if you've watched our previous 13 episodes then you know that elon musk is an innovation machine we think he is disrupted more industries than any human who has ever lived [music] to help us understand what we mean by disruption think of technology as a tree with all of its main branches medicine transportation computers energy and so on the disruption is a new branch off the main one which begins the tree growing in a new direction the invention of the wheel the invention of the automobile and so forth our human technology gets more advanced with each disruptive branch in the old branch the direction we were headed into prior to the disruption kind of fizzles out it stops growing when i think of great innovators names leonardo da vinci nikola tesla steve jobs mary curie and galileo come to mind undisputably great innovative minds for sure they have each moved technology forward tremendously but we think we have a strong case for stating that elon musk will go down in history as the ultimate disruptor you see if you look at our technology tree each of these great innovators has advanced human technology by starting at least one new branch many of them two branches marie curie for instance the pioneering physicist and chemist discovered two elements and had breakthroughs in radioactivity that disrupted our understanding of science she started new branches in her fields that moved human technology forward nikola tesla was way ahead of his time he invented and patented dozens of new technologies ac induction motors the radio that tesla coil and alternating current itself you could easily argue that many of nikola tesla's inventions disrupted the technology of his time starting many new branches on our human technology tree but can you think of anyone in history who is disrupted as many technologies so many industries the way so many people will live as elon musk let's refresh our memory paypal has changed how two major industries work the banking industry moving us from brick-and-mortar banks to sending money over the internet and helping ecommerce grow by giving people a secure way to move money effortlessly between buyers and sellers spacex has already the satellite industry by allowing for much cheaper rocket launches of all types into space tesla energy grid batteries are disrupting the world's electric power utility sector and by allowing us to switch off of fossil fuels and turn on renewable energy elon has disrupted big oil and boosted the budding solar and wind industries simultaneously tesla has also disrupted the world's car dealerships letting us buy a car from a website we can with practically every other product and moving us away from an antiquated system that benefits auto manufacturers not customers starlink will provide low cost low latency internet coverage via satellite to all of us around the globe disrupting the entire cable and internet service provider market the boring company will forever change how we get around reducing commute times and traffic making life in cities enjoyable disrupting the tunnel construction market and more tesla electric cars and soon trucks are disrupting the auto industry as we speak tesla's clean powertrain is making the internal combustion engine and fossil fuels obsolete and tesla's autonomous cars will be disrupting the ride sharing industry big auto and the computer hardware industry as we've shown in episode 10 tesla's solar roof will disrupt the roofing industry and tesla insurance could easily disrupt the auto insurance industry neural link is disrupting how we interact with computers and is basically inventing a whole new branch of human medicine technology open ai could save all of us from the impending threat of a global artificial intelligence that definitely deserves a branch wouldn't you say or maybe its own tree hyperloop and the intercontinental starship flights will disrupt air travel for sure along with pretty much all other modes of long-distance travel and starship interpret airy rockets are disrupting how humans will colonize the solar system and beyond i would argue that's a new seed for a tree that will begin growing on mars so many innovations so many disruptions in so many fields all happening as we speak and why is he working tirelessly to innovate all the time it's not for the money everything elon does is for the benefit of humanity and our planet elon has such an amazing combination of imagination an uncanny ability to re-examine everything under the lens of first principles and the determination to put all of his energies into bettering our planet if we're able to become an interplanetary species it'll be because elon musk pushed the envelope to get us there pick up a history book and you'll find the names of great people throughout the ages who have changed our world forever we believe history will remember this man as elon the disrupter thanks for watching now you know thanks so much for watching now you know we work hard to bring you videos about things that we think you'll find useful but we need to know from you

E for Electric,PLXAbfWOvf5YuRkLiW3Tj6ZSIK0Zq6amxV,08H8R6pNiXI,"tesla model y versus the volkswagen id4 in just 5 minutes the model y is the best selling car in the world and the volkswagen id4 is the last car i drove in the us for 2 years before moving to thailand despite my and many other id4 owners disappointing experiences with the id4 which came down to software issues and volkswagen's inability to fix them it does does appear that the current version of the id4 does have a lot of those issues resolved and i will also tell you one interesting fun fact about the id4 that you may not know about at the end of the now let's start with one thing that everyone cares about the price the model y starts just under $50,000 but keep in mind that tesla sets their own prices as a direct to consumer seller and those prices change all the time the id4 starts at just a little over $440,000 so about a $10,000 difference both are qualified for the $7,500 tax credit in the us as long as you the buyer is qualified as well with the lease option as a good loophole now let's talk about the most important spec of any ev which is the range the model wise range starts at 200 79 epa rated miles and tops at 330 while the id4 range starts at 209 miles and tops at 275 0 to 60 is a pretty uneven battle here with the id 4's best performance in 5.7 seconds while model y gets it done in just 3.5 dc fast charging is also very one-sided with the id4 max charging ing rate topping at 170 kw juicing the battery from 10 to 80% in over 30 minutes while model wise max charging rate goes up to 250 kw charging it to 80% in just 15 minutes on the other hand the id4 does come with 3 years of free unlimited charging with electrify america network though each session is capped at 30 minutes while tesla does not offer any free charging at all now let's get into some fun stuff but before that a quick reminder that this is brought to you by neo charge you can now charge two cars at the same time without spending a ton of money on rewiring your home all you need is the smart splitter from new charge get one today and use the discount code in the description of this now onto some fun stuff as i'm sure you've heard tesla has the best driver assistance stack on the market market in its autopilot which comes standard but the full self driving package is not what's advertised and it will set you back $155,000 or about $200 a month if you go with the subscription option the id4 has the iq drive system which isn't much but i did enjoy the car nudging me gently back into my lane when i got close to the edge tesla also has a great infotainment system with music and game streaming apps including youtube and netflix but it does have a huge shortcoming which is a deal breaker for me personally and that's the lack of android auto and apple carplay tesla's century mode is essentially a 360 dash cam suite running at all times that doubles as a security system that monitors the car when you're gone and warrants other humans to stay away both are must haves in any car if you ask me but the recordings do not have audio at the same time tesla's major shortcoming for many people is the lack of manual adjustments for air vents id4 on the other hand is lacking a front the front trunk which many people love now as promised a fun fact about the id4 is that because volkswagen is owned by the volkswagen group the id4 has two sister evs that are pretty much the same car under a different brand one of them is the skod anak not available in the us and the fancy sister is the audi q4 rron well here you have it the model y versus the id4 but if neither one tickled you fancy don't worry there are over 30 other crossover evs that you can pick from and i have jammed all of them into this right here all right looking forward to all of your comments other than that see you guys next time and remember to stay charged",3
E for Electric,PLXAbfWOvf5YuRkLiW3Tj6ZSIK0Zq6amxV,Z-CFXTgzirU,tesla model y versus the kia ev6 in just 5 minutes can kia compete with the world's best selling electric car in model y well you will be surprised how well it actually can so let's get started and we will begin with the most important spec of any car the price the model y starts at just under fifty thousand dollars and tops out at a little over 70 where the ev6 starts at around five thousand dollars less and tops out in the mid 60s however that gap is easily closed by the 7 500 tax credit in the united states that the model y is qualified for where the ev6 does not of course it is now much harder to qualify as a buyer but there is a loophole of leasing the car and getting that sweet 7 500 discount no matter what though not all dealers will do it alright now the second most important spec of any ev is of course the range in this case both cars push beyond the 300 mile epa range with the model y options spanning from 279 to 330 miles and ev6 ranging from 232 to 310. it is important to note that tesla's do underperform their epa ratings more than other evs including kia now 0-60 is usually the category where model y rules the electric crossover segment but this time we've got a rare exception while the model y covers 0 to 60 in impressive 3.5 seconds the ev6 does it in just 3.4 now let's talk about fast charging on paper both of these cars look almost identical the model y claims to have the max rate of 250 kilowatts charging from 0 to 80 percent in just 15 minutes while the ev6 stops out at 240 kilowatts charging 10 to 80 percent in 18 minutes however pretty much all independent tests have shown that tesla's times are closer to half an hour which is double of what's advertised the ev6 also has a perk which is 1 000 kilowatt hours of free charging at electrify america which translates into 3500 to 4 000 miles and that should be good enough for a few road strips tesla on the other hand does not offer any free charging now let's get into some fun stuff but before that a quick reminder that this is brought to you by neo charge you can now charge two cars at the same time without spending a ton of money on rewiring your home all you need is the smart splitter from new charge get one today and use the discount code in the description of this now let's talk about some cool features including the tech the model y has the best driver assist tech on the market with the autopilot which comes free but don't confuse it with a twelve thousand dollar full self driving package formerly priced at fifteen thousand dollars which i have long believed is the worst offered value of any car feature on the planet ev6 driver assist feature and it is pretty average model y does offer tons of infotainment including the apps netflix and youtube plus various music streaming apps and an internet browser it also offers a sentry mode by far the best built-in dash cam and e-security system in one however it is lacking some big common features that are all deal breakers for me including the complete absence of the android auto and apple carplay integration instrument panel or head up display and a manual adjustment for air vents ev6 offers the v2l capabilities so you can power your house appliances or a campsite the augmented reality head-up display in five different levels of regen braking though its frank is so tiny it's barely a lunch box ev6 has a bit of a better warranty at five years 60 000 miles versus model wise four year 50 000 mile one 20 u3 ninja safety recalls for the model y to just one for the ev6 now if you're me and you're not a big fan of either one of them the ev6 was the only car i've ever returned early to the car manufacturer and i only drove the model y because it was part of my job and i hated it well not to worry there are over 30 other crossover evs that you that you're from and i have jammed for you into this right here alright looking forward to all of your comments other than that see you guys next time and remember to stay charged,3
E for Electric,PLXAbfWOvf5YuRkLiW3Tj6ZSIK0Zq6amxV,FrzTjVmAXmI,tesla model y or the hyundai ioni 5 5 minutes two evs one handsome host let's get it on the model y has started the year as the most sold car in the world not an electric car any car and the ionic 5 is one of the most popular up-and-comers gaining in sales this year both car makers have put out four electric cars to the market so far both are electric crossovers but both are very different we gotta start with the price and that's where things are getting a little tricky already the model y is priced starting at just under fifty thousand dollars currently but tesla changes prices more often than elon musk tweets or axes or whatever you call that thing nowadays i call it the worst place on the internet now the model y for a federal tax credit 7 500. in the united states but not all buyers are you have to figure out if you are one of them the ionic 5 is priced at more of a steady price starting in low 40s but of course since it's sold through dealerships that price changes from customer to customer and it is not qualified for the tax credit even if you are so you have to figure out what these cars would cost you so get your calculators out mine is already built into my watch because you know i'm not a nerd model y has an epa range from 279 miles to 330 miles which is a bit higher than ionic fives of 220 to 303 epa rated miles but as many studies have shown tesla's real world range drops much more significantly than hyundai's especially in cold weather conditions now i don't know why people care about 0 to 60 when it comes to crossovers but here they are the model y's best is 5.0 seconds and ionic 5's best is 7.4 now here's the thing the ioni 5 comes with two years of free charging at electrify america stations in the us with a half an hour limit where tesla hasn't offered free supercharging in many years now so you get none when the rdc fast charging tesla claims the model y can charge from zero to eighty percent or add about 200 miles in 15 minutes and the ionic 5 claims to charge from 10 to 80 percent in 18 minutes but if you calculate the miles gained per minute of charging the ionic 5 comes out on top with 8.6 miles per minute while the model y only gets 7.8 now let's get to some fun features and that's where things get interesting but before that a quick reminder that this is brought to you by neo charge itching to buy another electric car but don't want to deal with paying an electrician to rewire your home for that second charger well check out the dual car smart splitter from new charge get one today and use the discount code in the description of this okay so on with the fun stuff tesla does have a pretty good driver assistance feature with the autopilot but falsely labeled the full self-driving package which is not at all full self driving unless you spell full wrong is not only costly at fifteen thousand dollars but has not worked as advertised well ever the model y has the best dash cam and the security surveillance system and you buy a weapon defense mode which is useful when the air quality is bad or the russians are coming the model y does have a e7 cedar option but the extra two seats are just big enough for a large cat but the model y does not have what have been common and necessary features in pretty much all other cars the android auto and apple carplay or the instrument panel or the head-up display or the side mirror blind spot indicators or the adjustable air vents pretty much all of those are my personal deal breakers the ionic 5 on the other hand has the augmented reality head-up display and the vehicle to load capability where you can power tech toys and appliances and even charge another ev a tesla model y the model y has had 23 nitza safety recalls for the model where the ioni 5 only had a couple that's all you need to know which one would you pick let me know in the comment section but if you would to know about over 30 other crossover ev alternatives to both of these check out this right here alright looking forward to all of your comments other than that see you guys next time and remember to stay charged,-1
E for Electric,PLXAbfWOvf5YuRkLiW3Tj6ZSIK0Zq6amxV,6-XUGVmh0MA,this is a new electric car from a new electric car maker that very few people have heard of before it's been fast it's been fast so why some buyers choose this new kit on a block the vinfest vf-8 electric crossover over the almighty tesla model y why not why well there are at least five reasons why they do and i'll tell you all about them but before that what's been fast and where did they come from in short vin fast is a vietnamese automaker that's already been making cars for about five years and is owned by the vin group a multi-billion dollar empire that originally started by selling and this is the cool part of the story instant noodles in ukraine and now owns vietnam's biggest resorts properties universities along with the automaker then fast it has already started deliveries of its vf8 electric crossover in the united states earlier this year and it has at least three more models coming to market by the end of this year the vf6 the vf7 and the vf9 much many first model girls from the new and the legacy automakers winfast had a rough goal with the automotive media which means they do have some work to do but i do have to say that those are the same media outlets that have given a pass to brands tesla rivian and lucid for very similar and even much worse issues if you want to know why that happens well i made an entire why none of you should trust those professional car reviewers especially from bigger publications and influencers and i have linked to it in the description of this so let's talk about the vin fast vf8 versus tesla model y the model y is by far the most popular ev in the world and will stay that way for probably at least a couple of more years almost no electric crossover out there can beat it on more traditional specs range charging and software but the gap is closing now i should mention that when it comes to range at first glance the model y is way ahead of the vf8 but those are the epa numbers which when it comes to tesla have very little to do with reality when it comes to the real world range when both were tested by the current driver magazine the tesla model y has gone down from 316 epa rated miles to 220 miles in a real world in the 75 mile an hour test while the vf8 outperformed its 191 mile epa range at that time with the 210 real world miles of the same test common within only 10 miles of teslas since then that model-wise variant has added 14 miles of epa range in their 2023 models and later this year vf8 will be upgrading its epa range again to 243 and 264 miles depending on the variant with all of that said let's talk about why some people are very much still choosing the vf8 over the model y well let's start with number one though in no particular order and it's the fact that bin fast is a new toy on the market it's made in an exotic country and styled by an exotic design house pinion farina responsible for designing cars for brands ferrari alfa romeo maserati and a few others so if you driving something different than everyone else i do well this is a very interesting option obviously if you are vietnamese american what a great way to show your pride in your nation's first exported vehicle now let's get back to some actual features that winfest has that tesla doesn't and this one is absolutely a deal breaker for me i am talking about the android auto and apple carplay i exclusively use my phone to essentially bring my world into my car or any other car that i'm in you can't do that with tesla while you can with vin fast it is available as an optional add-on subscription as part of winfest's online plus package the only other major brand that doesn't have the android auto and apple carplay implementation is rivian though gm is also thinking about phasing it out at some point with which i think is a sure way to push its reputation even further into the dirt number three and this one falls into the what happens to the good old days category the traditional manual controls now don't get me wrong i am all for cutting edge high tech but sometimes by making things better the progress ends up making things worse and tesla is guilty of throwing a few of those improvements in the steering wheel controls in the model y are down to just two push scroll buttons where the vf8 has plenty of controls that come very handy while driving when you don't have to take your eyes off the road changing the volumes skipping tracks launching voice controls cruise control and a few other features same goes for the air conditioning vents when you're driving and you want the airflow off your face or on your face most people prefer to just reach out to the air vents and change those by touch we've all done for decades and never complained that this needs to be improved you can't do that in tesla either you have to navigate this through the touchscreen which is very annoying and and in many cases unsafe and last but not least this side mirror built-in blind spot indicators when you look to check your side mirrors most cars including the vf8 will also give you a visual indication if you have someone in your blind spot that's simple and what i feel necessary a safety feature is somehow missing in tesla those resources instead must have gone into the fourth app development which brings me to number four and it is also a deal breaker for me and many others the instrument cluster it's that screen behind the steering wheel where you see the car's virals the speed the driving gear the state of charge and the navigation guidance now as you can see neither car has one but the vf8 has the head-up display which is arguably even better and safer way to present those numbers to the driver vf8's head-up display is in color and both the position and the brightness are adjustable tesla has no instrument cluster or the head of display and the reason for it makes it even worse because there is very little doubt in anyone's mind that it was removed to make more profits for tesla while taking the feature away from the customers and finally number five and it is a big deal it really is this is where vin fast is not only better than tesla but literally every automaker out there electric or gas it has arguably one of the most important features to many buyers the best bumper to bumper warranty in the industry vinfast offers a 10-year or 125 000 mile bumper to bumper warranty including unlimited mile battery warranty with 24 7 support in comparison tesla's bumper to bumper warranty is pretty much industry standard for year 50 000 mile one they do offer much all others in much longer powertrain warranty but that one only covers well the powertrain now i do want to mention a bonus feature that may be not as huge as the warrant team or other features but instead still pretty big the vf8 can actually integrate with alexa so you can control all sorts of things playing music listening to podcasts managing your smart home devices and a bunch of other stuff that tesla can't so there you go but did you know that there are over 30 electric crossovers that are coming to market just this year that they're all alternatives to the tesla model y it's true and i have jammed them all for you right here in this that you can watch right now alright looking forward to all of your comments other than that see you guys next time and remember to stay charged,-1
E for Electric,PLXAbfWOvf5YuRkLiW3Tj6ZSIK0Zq6amxV,OftWSCNr40g,"tesla model y versus the toyota bz 4x in just 5 minutes can toyota compete with the brand that took over its crown of the most valued car company in the world well you be the judge so let's get going and we'll start with the first thing that most people want to know about any product the price the model y starts at around $45,000 and tops out at around 70 but tesla changes their prices more often than elon musk twe so check tesla's website for the latest the bz 4x's starting price is a couple of grand lower at around 43 grand and it tops out at around 60 now here's something interesting while i was looking up the max price of this car adding up all of the accessories i've realized this is the most dog friendly car ever look at all of the dog accessories and options you can get however the bz 4x is not not qualified for the $7,500 us tax credit where the model y is now let's talk about the most important spec of any ev the range the model y can go anywhere from 260 to 330 epa rated miles on one charge where the bz4 access epa range spans from 242 to 252 miles now let's talk about the fast charging the model y can charge at the max rate of 250 kow filling up the battery from 0 to 80% in 15 minutes but most of the main dependent tests have shown that it's actually closer to about half an hour bz 4x on the other hand charges at the max rate of only 150 kw filling up the battery from 10 to 80% in the same half an hour now bz forx does come with a one year of free unlimited charging at the evo charging network while the model y does not come with any free charging perks at all let's talk about the tech self-driving and other fun stuff but before that a quick reminder that this is brought to you by energy pal are you thinking about going soler but not sure what panels to get whether or not to get a home battery or how much all of this is going to cost well energy pill will do all of that for you and you will get a $500 gift card when your installation is complete if you use the link in the description of this they even have this ev calculator that will tell you exactly what system to get so it can handle charging your ev all year round that link is down there as well let's continue with some fun stuff so let's talk about the driver assistance features the model y has the best one on the market by far in the autopilot that comes free with every tesla not to be confused with the $112,000 full self driving package which i believe is the biggest consumer scam in the recent automotive history bz4 acc drive assist feature called toyota safety sense 3.0 couldn't be a scam even if it wanted to because it's so basic it's david blain designed it it's not even there tesla's infotainment system is one of the best on the market with netflix youtube and many other streaming music and game apps built in it also has the one-of-a-kind dash cam and security system built in called the century mode which is one of the best perks of any tesla however the model y is missing some of the most basic but yet important features the android auto and apple carplay instrument panel headup display and it also lacks manual vent and side mirror adjustments the bz forx on the other hand is not a technological marvel by any stretch of imagination and that is actually its appeal as many people still want a traditional car with a traditional interior even if it is an ev however it doesn't have a front the front trunk that many evs have no one pedal driving and not even e glove box which is an odd choice the model y has been on the market 2 years longer than the bz forx and has already racked up 23 nitsa recalls to bz for access only one but it is the most embarrassing recall of all time because toyota couldn't in a kid not keep the wheels from falling off now if you're me and not crazy about either one of these two electric crossovers well don't worry there are over 30 other alternatives and i jamed all of them in this right here all right looking forward to all of your comments other than that see you guys next time and remember to stay charged",3
E for Electric,PLXAbfWOvf5YuRkLiW3Tj6ZSIK0Zq6amxV,pD1gBRxHEc8,"the tesla cyber truck versus the ran r1t now the r1t has been on the market for more than 2 years until the cyber truck showed up so let's see if rivan has used those two years to its advantage and if the r1t is that much better than the cyber truck so how do they compare all right so first let's compare the most important thing about any product that any customer cares about which is the price the cyber truck starts at around 60,00 ,000 where the r1t starts at around 75 now that's about a $115,000 difference which is significant but if that wasn't enough the cyber truck qualifies for the full $7,500 tax credit in the united states now that's not enough cuz you as a buyer have to qualify as well and that's not simple but that's for you to decide but the r1t only qualifies for half of that so $3,750 that would be your tax credit for the r1t if you're qualified all right now that we satisfied your wallets requirements let's talk about the most important spec of any electric vehicle which is the range so the shortest range for the cyber truck is 250 mil where the r1 t's shortest range is 270 now there is a there's a caveat actually two caveats when it comes to tesla why wouldn't there be so the 250 mile range when it comes to tesla is not actually an epa rating where the r1ts 270 is as a matter of fact there's just no epa rating for the cyber truck at all which is crazy because the first deliveries have started so there should be but the 250 mile range is just an estimate by tesla which really doesn't mean much but that's all we have to go on at this point the longest range for the cyber truck is 340 mi to r1ts back best range of 410 and that's the epa rated miles now remember how i said there were two caveats well here's the second one so when tesla has unveiled the cyber truck over four years ago and that went smoothly they promised over 500 mil of range and once again that was 4 years ago as you can see now in 2023 when i'm making this uh they could only get it to 340 so what to do what to do what to do well tesla came up with a genius idea of a range extender now the range extender is supposed to extend the range to over 470 miles now here's the thing uh it it it might uh it's not on the market right now we don't even know how much it's going to cost though it makes sense if it will be around $10,000 but it is not something that you can just put in and out of the cyber truck it's going to be very heavy so it will be a permanent installation which means because of its size it will take onethird of the cyber truck's bed for you to have this range extender honestly i think this is the most embarrassing thing that tesla has done with the cyber tr and i have seen this live yeah i was there for this now before we get to a bunch of other specs and something that actually tesla did that rivan didn't and this is a big deal i'll tell you what it is in just a second but before that a quick reminder that this is brought to you by energy pal are you thinking about going solar but not sure what panels to get whether or not to get a home battery or how much all of this is going to cost well energy p will do all of that for you and you will get a $500 gift card when your installation is complete if you use the link in the description of this oh and they even have this ev calculator that will tell you exactly what system to get so it can handle charging your ev all year around that link is down there as well all right now let's move on to 0 to 60 which is kind of weird when we're talking about pickup trucks but at the same time kind of cool because we're talking about pickup trucks and yet this is a thing because the r1t can go 0 to 60 in just 3.0 seconds which is amazing but the cyber truck can do it in 2.6 i mean there are tons of sports cars out there in the market that can't get close to that now let's talk about the driver assist features which is the driver plus for the r1t and it is okay it's not bad however the cyber truck because it is a tesla has the autopilot and the autopilot is by far the best driver assistance system in the world it is almost flawless at this point don't get it confused with the full self-driving uh package that tesla offers for i don't know $1,00 000 right now it changes it went up to 15,000 at some point i believe it is the biggest scam in the automotive industry uh in the past several years that's not what i'm talking about the autopilot that one is awesome all right now let's talk about the fast charging now before i throw some numbers at you we got to talk about tesla's supercharging network because a lot of tesla drivers believe and i actually don't disagree with them that tesla's supercharger network is the best feature of the car there are over 50,000 of stalls around the world with over 5,000 actual physical locations and it is a smooth great experience now there are other public fast charging networks out there electrify america evo fast n in europe and many others and they're fine and there are plenty of locations for them as well they're just not anywhere near as smooth as the tesla superchargers now of course because it is tesla there is a caveat uh next year tesla is going to be opening up their supercharger network for the reasons i still don't quite understand to other ev brands so that is best feature uh is going to be going away so that kind of sucks if you're a tesla driver it is absolutely awesome if you're a rivan driver or any other evv driver so keep that in mind now let's talk about the numbers really quick 220 kwatt maximum charging rate for the r1t 250 for the cyber truck tesla claims that it will add 136 m in 15 minutes a lot of independent tests proven that it's probably not the case but you be your own judge the r1t is supposed to add 140 m in 20 minutes just on the rivian adventure network so that's a bit what fuzzy math as i remember who remembers that term anyway remember when the elections were simple anyway so those are the numbers uh they are not bad actually these are not bad rates so both trucks are actually very decent when it comes to fast charging now let's talk about the infotainment before we get to a big one uh where tesla has a huge advantage now the infotainment system is great in tesla as you know you can play games watch netflix and youtube and there are a couple of monitors up front and the back now rivan has an infotainment system as well but it's just not as awesome as tesla's however tesla doesn't have the android auto and the apple carplay which to me would be a deal breaker because every other automaker has one except for one and it is rivan this is one of those times where actually this is a draw of both vehicles not having something very very important there's another thing that i usually criticize tesle is for not having the uh manual vents for the air conditioning guess what neither does the r1t the only other thing that tesla is missing that i've always criticized uh is the lack of headup display and the instrument panel now the r1t does have the instrument panel so uh you know they're close at sucking at these basic basic features that pretty much all other cars have there is another drawer which is in the max towing capacity which is 11,000 for both which is not bad at all now let's talk about a couple of unique features that tesla has which rivan just does not at all one is the exoskeleton that's made out of stainless steel now it is a plus in some ways for example it's very sturdy uh you know you you can ding it easily uh you can shoot a 9 mim into it so it's essentially bulletproof uh it's got armored glass by the way also and uh a lot of people believe it looks really cool however of course if you do get in in an accident the pretty much no body shops out there until tesla builds some uh to fix the damn thing and it's probably going to be very very expensive so that's problem number one and the problem number two is of course it only comes in a color of your refrigerator because it's just stainless steel now tesla will wrap it in in black or white for you uh for thousands of thousand of dollars but as far as the original color is concerned that's it now one thing thing that the cyber truck has that the r1t doesn't which is a big deal is the bir directional charging that means that tasla can use its big battery to power up a lot of stuff your campsite your work site and even your house during a blackout so that's a big win for tesla now rivan did have two amazing features that they were advertising until they actually went in production and then they said yeah we're not doing that uh the first one was the tank turn which was really awesome because the r1t has four motors so it can do it the cyber truck has only three so it can't and the second one was the outdoor kitchen that came out of the gear tunnel as rivan calls it that one is gone as well so there you have it which one would you choose the cyber truck the r1t or you know there are a few others on the market and i have videos for them as well but if you want to just see the pros and cons of whether or not you should purchase a cyber truck yourself well i have that for you right here all right looking forward to all of your comments other than that see you guys next time and remember to stay charged",3
E for Electric,PLXAbfWOvf5YuRkLiW3Tj6ZSIK0Zq6amxV,C3nc4gZ7fTg,"the tesla cyber truck versus its biggest rival the ford f-150 lightning now that the cyber truck is out and most not all but most of its specs are known we can finally compare it to the lightning that beat it to the market by about a year and a half let's start with the most important spec for pretty much any product which is the price the cyber truck starts at around $60,000 where the lightning is a bit closer to 50 about a 9,000 difference actually now the good news is that both are qualified for the $7,500 federal tax credit in the us but as a buyer you still need to qualify yourself and that's a bit tougher now with the cyber truck of course the availability is going to be an issue since it's got about 2 million reservations as a matter of fact you won't even be able to buy a used cyber truck within the first year because tesla is actually making people sign paperwork where they won't be able to resell it which is crazy now i don't know if i want to compare looks here because well the f150 lightning looks pretty much the same as the regular gas powered f-150 minus the grill and with a cyber truck i've noticed that pretty much all people are divided into two categories the first one the tesla fans believe that it is absolutely stunning and gorgeous and the rest of us you know now let's move on to comparing the most important spec of any elect elect car especially the electric truck and i'll explain why in a second now i do have to say that the cyber tru does not have an epa rating at all and definitely no other rating from any other country because the cyber truck is only going to be sold in the us so we're comparing what tesla is telling us it's going to have to an actual epa rating of the lightning so the cyber truck's shortest range is 250 mi to to the lightning's 240 epa rated miles the cyber truck's best range is 340 to the lightnings 320 again epa rated miles but there is a caveat with the cyber truck and honestly i think this is the dumbest thing i've ever heard however it does come with a range extender which means that you can actually installed this humongous box into the bed of the cyber truck permanently and it will take onethird of the entire bed and it will extend the range to 470 mil which is still less than they promised four years ago at the original unveiling now tesla has not announced the pricing for it and when it's going to be available my guess there's a pretty good chance it won't be available at all but for now both have a pretty comparable best and worst range and this is where my problem is because for any other electric car a passenger car that would be just fine that would be pretty good however these are i've heard electric trucks which means that people are going to be hauling stuff with it they will be transporting stuff in the bed of the truck they'll be going off-roading and doing many many other things which essentially cut the electric range of an electric vehicle by half so in my opinion neither one has an appropriate range especially knowing that you're not going to get even the upper range unless the price goes up into you know yeah now let's compare something that i never would have thought we would be talking about when it comes to pickup trucks but when it comes to electric pickup trucks well it's actually a thing now before that though a quick reminder that this is brought to you by energy pal are you thinking about going solar but not sure what panels to get whether or not to get a home battery or how much all of this is going to cost well energy p will do all of that for you and you will get a $500 gift card when your installation is complete if you use the link in the description of this they even have this ev calculator that will tell you exactly what system to get so it can handle charging of your ev all year around that link is down there as well all right now let's talk about something i never thought i would be talking about it is 0 to 60 performance of these two electric trucks the f-150 lightning has a pretty impressive 4.0 seconds 0 to 60 but the cyber truck has the amazing 2.6 seconds let's right 0 to 60 in 2.6 seconds now let's talk about the fast charging now before i compare numbers uh let's let's talk about the tesla supercharging network because a lot of tesla owners believe it is literally the best feature of any tesla and you know they're not wrong tesla's fast charging network the superchargers is by far better than any other fast charging network in the world so let's get that out of the way now ford and others get access to many other independent fast charging networks the electrify america evo and many others in europe so they do exist there are plenty of them the experience is just not as good however tesla has decided and i i'm still dumbfounded by this tesla has decided that they will be opening up their tesla supercharger network to the rest of the ev community which is great for us which is great for the community but uh not so much for the current tesla owner so it is a huge benefit right now it is not going to be this way uh that much longer let's talk about numbers the ford f-150 lightning has a max charging rate of just 155 kw it's not great the cyber truck has 250 which is much much better but honestly i kind of i expected something much much more there is a rumor that once the v4 superchargers are everywhere it might go up to 350 or 400 but for now it is 250 both have pretty big franks as a matter of fact four claims that their mega fran is the biggest in the industry and that might very well be by the way the frun is the front trunk uh since there is no engine and just a much smaller water there's a lot of space as a matter of fact it is the most secured space in any electric vehicle so they both have it and both are pretty large now it's funny that ford's slogan i don't even know if it is still is built tough because actually the cyber tru is because the cyber tru is made out of an exoskeleton that's made out of the stainless steel which you know will cause a lot of problems with repairs and insurance i believe so that's something that is we don't know yet but i smell a lot of trouble because there are no independent repair shops that can repair an exoskeleton made out of uh stainless steel now tesla claims that the doors are bulletproof uh you know you can just shoot a 9mm in it and it will be perfectly fine of course the stainless steel does reduce dse and damage and long-term corrosion and many many other positive things um you can you know hit it with a bat uh at the same time because uh it is stainless steel it only comes with you know one color now tesla will wrap it in black or white again just two more colors for thousands of thousands of extra dollars but as far as the original color is just one the color of your refrigerator oh and it also has armored glass so if you're planning on go into war this is a perfect vehicle for you uh now obviously the f-150 lightning doesn't have any of that so we're just going to put it in a personal choice category all right now there is one really cool thing that we need to talk about that both of these trucks do have which is the bidirectional charging which means the battery of this truck either one of them can be used to power up a lot of stuff including your campsite including your work site and even including your house during a blackout though you do need to buy some extra equipment in both cases and of course let me mention something that i mention in every when i compare a tesla to a non-tesla because there are a lot of features that are common in pretty much all other cars electric or gas the tesla just doesn't have in any of theirs except for the model s and the model x which i do believe are the best teslas by far but they don't sell too many of them so it's a bit of a mood point here so the cyber truck will not have the android auto or the apple carplay play which is insane uh obviously doesn't have an instrument panel or the head-up display uh it's missing a lot of other features the manual mirror and air vent controls which again i think are just safety issues and if not violations so just keep that in mind because obviously the lightning has all of them all right so you be the judge and if you want to dive into the pros and cons of the cyber truck specifically i have that for you right here all right looking forward to all of your comments other than that see you guys next time and remember to stay charged",3
E for Electric,PLXAbfWOvf5YuRkLiW3Tj6ZSIK0Zq6amxV,WAH_NDXBvp8,[music] foreign want to get e4 the mustang machi or any other electric car over the tesla model why the model y is the best selling electric vehicle in the world who would want to do that i mean oh that's right i would and so would and have quite a few people despite the fact that model y trumps the mustang monkey in a lot of categories you probably have heard all the car experts talk about the model y starting price is a bit cheaper if you take the us federal tax credit in consideration which the mustang mach e is only qualified for half off though i should mention that tesla has had a price change pretty much every month this year so far [music] so whenever you're watching this make sure to um price cap price check on four model y does go further on a single charge but not by a drastic number model y also does charge up to three times faster using the dc fast chargers which most eb drivers use on the road it also has better 0 to 60 time has more torque and horsepower now you're probably saying well alex there you go tesla wins game over see you later not so fast because these are the specs that you probably hear people talk about but those are not always what most people actually care about kind of the kardashians or the democracy you can't question things take the for example the lower end model are at 224 miles for the mustang machi and 279 for the model y a bit of a difference but is it in reality this number is very much irrelevant to most drivers who own average drive around 50 miles a day and charge their cars every night you're not very likely to drive 279 or 224 miles on any given day except a couple of road trips a year if that but there are some real world differences that make the mustang machi more attractive or in some cases model y less attractive for a lot of buyers myself there are actually five pretty big ones if you don't even talk about the looks which i personally think certainly go to the mustang mach e hands down but i big trunks and i cannot lie so what are they well let's go over all five of them right now but before that a quick reminder that this is brought to you by flow always reliable extremely durable the flow home is a level 2 ev charging station designed to make your life easier and is compatible with any ev north america learn more about the flow home at flow.com and by new charge you can charge two cars at the same time without spending a ton of money on rewiring your home all you need is a smart splitter from newer charge get one today and use the discount code in the description of this so the number one reason though in no particular order why people would pick the ford mustang mach e over the tesla model y is not so much what ford has but what tesla doesn't the instrument cluster it's the small screen that sits behind your steering wheel and now in some cars complemented by a head-up display with cars most important real-time numbers speed range and state of charge the model y doesn't have either not the instrument cluster nor the head of display option in any of the model y or model 3 cars is just one center screen which is still slightly smaller than the mustang mach ease but the reason why tesla has decided not to offer the instrument cluster to their customers is even more disappointing than the lack of the feature itself it is clearly to save money and pad the profit margin for the brand what elon musk trying to make more money by giving his customers less not the man who came up with twitter's blue check mark subscription that can't be and when elon was asked about it on twitter he has provided a pretty poor and a bit of a dickish explanation saying you won't care apparently many people do because no other car in the world has more of the third party made instrument cluster add-on products sold then the tesla model y and three let's move on to number two and you know how when you're driving and you're trying to get some cool breeze on your face or maybe the heat off your face and you just reach out to the vent and adjust that yeah you can't do that with the model y you have to dig in a center screen's user interface to do that digitally which means you can't do it while driving safely and even if you are on autopilot it takes so much more time and effort it is just another example where the technology made things harder rather than easier same goes to model wise side mirror adjustments except for to get that done you have to utilize the screen the steering wheel and then touch your left ear with your right hand okay i might have exaggerated one of them but anytime a consumer has to learn a new service to that consumer consume sometimes buttons are still good i pressing buttons especially of the tesla fanboys because they're so nice to me what uh just look at the comment section they should be gathering there right now and the mustang machi has the manual controls for both of those features that you got used to since you probably learned how to drive number three and this is a big one tesla model y is not compatible with android auto or apple carplay based on the recent consumer report survey the majority of drivers prefer one of the two over the car maker's native infotainment systems the only other car maker that does not support android auto or apple carplay is rivian though rivian doesn't really support their own features that they've promised the portable camp kitchen the tank turn or honoring pricing for their loyal customers gm did announce that they may do this same but hopefully this time they will recognize their mistake before actually making yet another bad decision at the end of the day 98 of all new cars support android auto or apple carplay including of course the mustang machi and there is a good reason for that number four is something that none of us care about until we do when we get into a car accident get our car broken into or just get it scratched while parked then we care a lot i'm talking about where to take it for repairs this service centers obviously the more service centers out there the shorter the repair times and most importantly repair costs are this is where tesla struggles according to tesla there are 176 service centers in the united states there are 413 ford service centers now you're probably saying well it's twice as many but that's still not that bad until i tell you that those are just in texas that's right 413 service centers just here in texas there are almost 5 000 nationwide and that's not it what is even harder to find than the tesla service centers or the tesla parts that is what causes huge delays tesla parts are not readily available to general public or repair stores and even teslas own and certified repair shops struggle to get parts for weeks and even months parts for ford on the other hand are easier to find than the disgruntled tesla fans in the comments section of my videos repair shops auto parts stores and even amazon are all places where you can easily find ford parts ford even has a website where anybody can order one my cat ordered a tire from there and as you can see is very happy with his purchase he likes the shade who's the good ford customer and number five is insurance you know many times the second largest bill you have to pay to have a car tesla's unique and breakthrough architecture is great for profit margins and overall design to geek out over but it comes with some major challenges when it comes to repairs from limited availability of parts that we've already discussed and thus delays and repairs to simply hire repair costs due to a small number of tesla certified shops in their high repair rates her money geeks data the average cost of insurance for a ford mustang machi is a 1784 dollars per year where the average rate of insuring tesla model y is 2878 dollars which is more than 60 percent i even ran my own test and got a quote from state farm talk to a very nice guy named jake with a most comparable model y and the mustang mach e configurations the mustang mock e quote came in at 437 dollars per month compared to 531 for the model y in 22 difference or about twelve hundred dollars more for the annual policy for me almost every single one of these points is a deal breaker in favor for the mustang monkey but it is different for everyone now this is something you may not know but besides the ford mustang mach e there are actually more than 30 other alternatives to the model y and i have listed all of them right here in this so check it out other than that see you guys next time and remember stay charged,3
E for Electric,PLXAbfWOvf5YuRkLiW3Tj6ZSIK0Zq6amxV,dMjB-aNwwPQ,"tesla model y versus the poar 2 in just 5 minutes can this volvo owned new electric brand compete with its first ev against the world's best selling electric car the tesla model y you'll be the judge so let's get started and we will start with your wallet the model y starts at around $45,000 and tops out at around 70 but if you're watching this more than a week after it was up loaded you better check because tesla changes their prices all the time the price was dropped by more than $44,000 just as i was making this wait let let me check yep still the same yep the pole star 2 starts at a more of a steady price of a little over 50 grand and maxes out at around 72 however the poar 2 is not eligible for the $7,500 tax credit in the us where the model y absolutely is let's talk about the second most important spec of any electric car the range both models are able to go beyond 300 epa rated miles with the model y range spinning from 260 to 330 mi and the postar 2 offering just one range option of 320 mi now let's talk about the fast charging the model y can charge at the max rate of 2 50 kw using its supercharging network claiming to fill up your battery to 80% in just 15 minutes now the reason i say claiming is because plenty of independent tests have showed that the time is actually doubled and closer to half an hour fullstar 2's max rate is 205 kw and it is pretty honest about charging the battery from 10 to 80% in the same half an hour unlike many other electric crossovers neither model comes with any complimentary charging plans both are pretty fast of the line with the postar 2's best 0 to 60 time at 4.1 seconds where the model y can do it in very impressive 3.5 now let's move on to some fun stuff self-driving tech and nit recalls but before that a quick reminder that this is brought to you by energy pal are you thinking about going solar but not sure what panel to get whether or not to get a home battery or how much all of this is going to cost well energy pal will do all of that for you and you will get a $500 gift card when your installation is complete if you use the link in the description of this they even have this ev calculator that will tell you exactly what system to get so it can handle charging your ev all year around that link is down there as well all right let's talk about the driver assist features tesla has the best one on the market by far with the autopilot that comes standard with any tesla including the model y but don't confuse it with what i believe is the biggest scam in the car industry today the full self-driving package at $122,000 which was actually lowered from 15 the postar 2 does have a good list of driver assist features but they are mainly average the model y info tment setup is pretty impressive with the apps netflix and youtube plus tons of music and game streaming apps it also offers a sentury mode by far the best built-in dash cam and a security system in one however it is lacking some big common features which are all deal breakers for me a complete absence of the android auto and apple carplay integration instrument panel or headup display and manual adjust adjustment for air vents the poar 2 on the other hand has a more traditional interface that many people still very much prefer and a luxury well-built quality of the interior the po star 2 interface runs on the google android automotive os which allows for google maps better voice commands and even a few apps in its app store though the number of apps is still very much limited to just around 100 a full app store could have been a major difference maker for poar the model y can set up to two more people than the postar 2 23 nits safety recalls for the model y to p stars just two recalls now if you're wondering if there are other alternatives to these two electric crossovers well there are actually over 30 and i jammed all of them in the right here so check it out but other than that see you guys next time and remember to stay charged",3
E for Electric,PLXAbfWOvf5YuRkLiW3Tj6ZSIK0Zq6amxV,sHgO_tzxU-g,"the tesla cyber truck versus the hummer ev both are very unique electric trucks to say the least and both are not very available right now the cyber truck deliveries have just started in december of 2023 and even though the hummer ev has been on the road and in production for a couple of years now gm has not been making too many of them a couple of hundred a months on average so these are very rare vehicles right now hopefully there will be plenty of them in the future because i think that both of them are awesome in their own ways all right let's compare them side by side and i usually to start with the price now the cyber truck starts at around $60,000 where the hummer ev starts at around 100,000 now that's that's a pretty hefty difference at around $40,000 now on top of that the cyber truck is qualified for the $7,500 tax credit in the united states states though as a buyer you still have to qualify as well but the hummer ev is not qualified at all because of its high price so you get nothing now let's talk about the most important spec when it comes to all electric vehicles which is the range now before i throw all the numbers at you let me tell you about a bit of a caveat here because for some odd reason and i think this is insane the tesla cyber truck does not have the epa rating so the mileage that i'm going to be sharing with you is just whatever tesla estimates where the hummer ev numbers are rated epa range okay so let's start with the shortest range which for the cyber truck is 250 mil where for the hummer ev is almost 300 mil the longest range is much more impressive uh for the cyber truck it is 340 mi to the hummer evs 314 now there is another caveat here when it comes to the cyber truck because 4 years ago when the cyber truck was unveiled elon musk promised the range of over 500 miles as you can see uh the best they could do was 340 so in order to fix that little problem uh they've implemented an option of a range extender so the range extender is essentially another piece of a battery that will be permanently installed into the bed of the cyber truck thus taking 1/3 of that bed now we don't know what the pricing is going to be though it's probably going to be around $10,000 but it is supposed to extend the range to 470 mi now let's talk about 0 to 60 which normally is not a thing when it comes to the pickup trucks but in this case it's going to be exciting but before that a quick reminder that this is brought to you by energy pal are you thinking about going solar but not sure what panels to get whether or not to get a home battery or how much all of this is going to cost well energy p will do all of that for you and you will get a $500 gift card when your installation is complete if you use the link in the description of this now they even have this ev calculator that will tell you exactly what system to get so it can handle charging your ev all year around that link is down there as well all right now let's talk about 0 to 60 for these two pickup trucks and it is exciting because the hummer ev does 0 to 60 in just 3 seconds which is insane but not as insane as the cyber tru's 2.6 seconds now let's talk about the driver assist features which is important nowadays now the hummer ev offers the super cruise from gm which um honestly is not very good it just isn't i'm not a fan at all while the cyber truck because it is a tesla and every tesla offers the autopilot which i believe is by far hands down the best driver assist feature on the market right now now don't confuse this with the full self-driving package which i do believe is one of the biggest scams in the recent automotive history that's not what i'm talking about but the autopilot the autopilot is awesome all right before we talk about charging which is important let's talk about the infotainment because tesla really does have pretty much the best infotainment system out there the there is a a streaming app store there where you can play different kinds of games there is netflix there is youtube there are two screens it's pretty good however the hummer ev is probably the only other vehicle that i know of that can actually give tesla the run for their money because the infotainment system the graphics for it for the hummer v was designed by one of the top game companies out there so it looks pretty amazing now the cyber truck pretty much old teslas is missing a very important feature which is the implementation of the android auto and the apple carplay to me honestly it is a deal breaker i have no idea why they don't have it but they don't have it on the other hand the hummer ev actually has a very interesting feature that you can buy where they will install the cameras underneath the truck so you can actually see what's going on literally underneath you now let's talk about the dc fast charging and it is impressive for both now the cyber truck can charge at the max rate of 250 kw adding about 136 m in 15 minutes that's tesla's estimate where the hummer ev has a max charging rate of 350 kow adding 100 mil in 10 minutes that's pretty impressive now as always when we talk about fast charging we have to mention that a lot of tesla owners believe and i actually agree with them that the tesla supercharging network is the best feature of any tesla there are over 50,000 stalls out there in the world with over 5,000 locations and it is extremely smooth experience pretty much for any tesla owner however the caveat is that for some reason in 2024 tesla will be opening up their supercharging network to the rest of the ev drivers which is great for the rest of the ev drivers but not so great for the current and future t tesla drivers so something to keep in mind now let's pretend that people might actually use either one of these two as pickup trucks and talk about the towing capacity the max towing capacity for the cyber truck is 11,000 lb to the hummer evs 8500 lb now of course i have to mention that the cyber truck is made out of an exoskeleton that's made out of the stainless steel now it's a good thing and a bad thing now of course it's a good thing because it's very very sturdy it's ding proof as a matter of fact it is also bulletproof you can literally shoot a 9mm in it and apparently it's going to be just fine uh now on the other hand you know it's going to be very much impossible to find an independent body shops so these will have to be tesla body shops that they will still have to build up where you would be able to repair the cyber truck and of course that will probably drive the repair cost and therefore the insurance costs up and because it is stainless steel the cyber truck will only come in one color the color of your refrigerator now tesla will wrap your cyber trucks for thousands and thousands of dollars in black or white but at the end of the day you just get absolutely no color options now another unique feature that both of these trucks have is the ability to turn their back wheels the cyber truck has it and the hummer eevee has it the hummer eevee actually calls it the crab walk where the truck can actually go sideways just a little bit a crab and of course we got to talk about the bidirectional charging feature the cyber truck will have it right away where the hummer ev will have it implemented in 2024 essentially this is a feature where the battery of the truck will serve as your home battery where you can power your home during a blackout or you can power up your campsite or your work site when your truck is out and about both pretty unique and entertaining trucks if you ask me and if you want to know specifically about the pros and cons of the tesla

E for Electric,PLXAbfWOvf5YuRkLiW3Tj6ZSIK0Zq6amxV,nkVS4Ao5wSM,ford f-150 gas powered version versus the new all-electric version in just 5 minutes that's right the best selling vehicle in america now has an all-electric younger brother the f-150 lightning they may look almost the same on the outside but are very different on the inside the gas version has one big advantage but the lightning has two really cool features that are only available in the electric version that may win you over let's compare them side by side and see which one is for you and first we're gonna talk about your wallet and this is where things get a little complicated the gas powered f-150 starts at around 35 000 the electric lightning starts at little over fifty thousand dollars now right away you see the sixteen thousand dollar difference and probably go well so much for the future i'm out of here well actually wait don't leave just yet because if you look closer the numbers are actually almost identical first the reason the gas version is so much cheaper is because it is a stripped down commercial version that is not available in the electric one the starting price for the lightning already includes a lot of options the gas entry level one doesn't including the all-wheel drive secondly the f-150 lightning qualifies for the 7 500 instant tax credit as long as you qualify as a buyer in the us now there are many other state and the local incentives that many times add up to thousands and thousands extra dollars of discount and other countries also have their own incentives as well but that's still not it if you add the savings from paying for lower electric rates compared to your gas rates not having to pay for oil changes tune-ups transmission maintenance and brakes that's right electric car brakes last a very long time well if your calculator is working properly you will end up shaving thousands and thousands more dollars through your ownership of bringing the total cost down to pretty much the same as the entry level gas version price now let's talk about the range now while the electric lightning range is from 240 to 320 epa rated miles the gas version ranges from 460 to 720 miles depending on a trim but since your electric vehicle charges overnight daily it requires a way less range than the gas version that needs to last for at least a few days until it tripped to a gas station i should mention that the fast charging time for the lightning which you will need for long distance trips is subpar taking 44 minutes to charge the battery from 15 to 80 percent now let's talk about two really big features that are exclusive to the lightning but before that a quick reminder that this is brought to you by neocharge itching to buy another electric car but don't want to deal with paying an electrician to rewire your home for that second charger well check out the dual car smart splitter from new charge get one today and use the discount code in the description of this now the first thing that the electric f-150 has that the gas version doesn't is the front yes it's the front trunk it is a huge storage space under the hood where there is no longer any need for an engine this is a safe place to store tools or any other valuables the other feature that the lightning has is the ability to power up your house with its battery during a blackout you do have to invest a little extra into additional equipment to make it happen both versions can power up your work site and both have the driver assistant features in blue cruise and ford copilot 360. the lightning does get bigger center screen options and only comes in an all-wheel drive both start at 5000 pounds of towing capacity but the lightning caps out at 10 000 where the gas version goes up to 14. the electric version wins in max torque at 775 pound feet versus 640 with the gas version but the gas one wins in the max horsepower at 700 versus the electric 580. the lightning comes only with a five and a half foot bed where the gas version can be upgraded to six and a half or an 8 foot size though keep in mind the exercise is usually used for storage which is already available with the frank so here you go one truck two power trains the present and the future and if you would to know more about differences between the gas and electric powered cars well check out this right here alright looking forward to all of your comments other than that see you guys next time and remember to stay charged,3
E for Electric,PLXAbfWOvf5Ytlrxe40n0F7dGvWkqRpHM1,YtirJwXN7ow,this is huge tesla was just exposed by one of the biggest news publications and yet everyone in the tesla community refuses to talk about it so we're definitely gonna talk about it the claim uncovers what seems to be tesla's biggest lie told to their customers to date and the cover-up that has been taking place for more than 10 years at the direction of elon musk himself reuters in a recent investigative report claims that tesla has rigged its software in a diesel gate-like fashion to cover up a major issue and very recently has put together a team of its own employees whose job was to essentially gaslight their own customers to prevent them from finding out the real problem and here's a creepy part every time a tesla employee has convinced a concerned tesla customer to cancel the appointment so the problem wouldn't be discovered and fixed they would and i kid you not celebrate by jumping on the tables and striking a metal xylophone so now we know what it sounds when yet another tesla customer gets oh here's another one and i know a lot of us have become immune to the lies and that elon musk and his army of fans have flooded the media with but this one this one stands out by a mile now before we get to the juicy details it is no secret that what tesla advertises as the epa rated range is pretty much never what customers actually get when they buy the cars the recent research by edmonds showed that in a real world driving test tesla was pretty much the only major automaker consistently underperforming its epa rating by as much as almost 20 percent another study this time by recurrent author showed that teslas have underperformed their advertised range by as much as 50 percent in some conditions which actually was my experience when i was a three-time tesla owner heck even i conducted my own poll in my tesla model y community with over 70 000 members and the results were pretty consistent with the two studies with pretty much half of the owners reporting a range loss of up to 25 percent mind you these are the actual tesla owners with usually a pretty big bias very recently south korea became one of the first countries to find tesla for exaggerating the driving range to its customers in in the us the epa has on multiple occasions forced tesla to lower its cpa range numbers as they were believed to be too exaggerated now let's dive into the mind-blowing details of how tesla has rigged the system and kept it all from their customers but before that a quick reminder that this is brought to you by neocharge you can now charge two cars at the same time without spending a ton of money on rewiring your home all you need is the smart splitter from your charge get one today and use the discount code in the description of this so how did tesla lie so successfully all these years without getting caught well the report suggests that this all has started more than a decade ago when elon musk has instructed his software team to rig the range estimating software to show exaggerated range numbers that's right ac of e-car company has [music] to lie about the capabilities of his cars of course if it was any other ceo of any other company he would at the very least be fired or in some cases prosecuted not elon musk yeah he literally seems to get away with murder sometimes the government officials the watchdogs and the automotive media are simply too afraid to stand up to him even this very much a small youtube has gotten attacked by tesla community over the years for simply making videos this criticizing elon musk and tesla that's right the very community i am trying to stand up for attacks me for doing so year after year after year you can find some of them in the comments section of this probably right now but this is not it even if you follow the regulators and the watchdogs and the media you can't really fool your own customers who see that their cars don't really go as far as they were promised so many complained which posed a growing problem to tesla so what did they do to handle it well something that any company would do they've created their own internal team to essentially guess light their own customers that's right when customers contacted tesla about the insufficient range they were told that there was nothing wrong with their batteries even though many times no diagnostics were performed at all and when diagnostics were performed and other problems were found the team was instructed not to let customers know about those problems most customers who have had the range complaints have reported it was almost impossible to get a hold of etesla representative when the representative would finally call a customer back if the customer did not pick up the phone on the first try the case would be closed without any further attempts and then there was the creepy part yes that one the report claims that each supervisor had purchased the metallophone a xylophone with metal keys that employees struck to celebrate appointment cancellations these people such oh enough already huh now i should mention that the epa is partially to blame here as well the epa has very flexible and vague rules on how the epa rating is certified thus leading companies tesla take advantage of it and lie to its customers after all the epa has certified tesla's lies over and over again they need to change too but tesla is not the only one rigged to lie to its customers want to know how almost every mainstream automotive media lies to you when it comes to car reviews well i didn't need reuters to expose another automaker and the biggest youtube in this piece in this right here and this one is an exclusive so you gotta watch that other than that see you guys next time and remember to stay charged,3
E for Electric,PLXAbfWOvf5Ytlrxe40n0F7dGvWkqRpHM1,T5IJcjttlI0,tesla's got a new unexpected problem and it's the fact that now the cyber truck has to compete with a new upcoming electric truck that has many better specs and a much better range than cyber truck's current biggest rival the ford f-150 lightning i will tell you what it is as it's surprisingly impressive epa range has just been announced why ford should be scared of this more than tesla and also one of many reasons why sandy monroe has not been invited back on this for more than a year now so let's dive in now the cyber truck is finally going in production and tesla fans are excited you gotta give it to them they always are despite the fact that they have no idea what the specs are the fact that they can have it in any color they want as long as it is the color of the refrigerator or that it looks it was designed by a drunk five-year-old with a ruler glued to his hands i mean who would put down their hard-earned money to reserve oh what's that oh my cyber truck reservation um yeah let's let's go ahead and keep that now despite tesla releasing the specs then removing them and then now slowly hinting at what they may actually be its biggest competition so far has been the ford f-150 lightning that has been in production for a while and has sold over 20 000 of those babies to the praises of its owners and the automotive media except for one guy no not sandy he actually loves the damn thing and we'll get to him in a second uh it will oh that's right it was me i did not the range 320 miles with the bigger battery option well that would be just fine if it was a passenger car more than enough actually but it is a pickup truck and if by some chance some of its buyers decide to use it as a pickup truck which means loading it up with stuff hauling stuff and going off-roading and stuff the range can be cut by half and 160 epa rated miles is just not good enough and i know i know people don't really use pickup trucks as pickup trucks mainly they use them as very expensive glamorized booster chairs but let's just pretend for just one second they actually are pickup trucks now enter gm which has already released its silverado ev specs a while back and now they've announced its official epa range and it makes the lightning look a toy and that's why i got my cyber truck reservation a little sister the silverado ep reservation now they can play together and compete for daddy's attention but not everyone took gm seriously when the silverado ev was announced including sandy monroe let me tell you what he said back then but before that a quick reminder that this is brought to you by secant action fund one of the nation's best non-profits of fighting climate change just launched yet another ev raffle you could win in lucid air with a 500 mile battery or a rivian suv plus 10 years of recharging or a tesla model x the secant action fund one ups itself every year with these rap full prices while using the proceeds to promote clean energy for complete terms and to enter the raffle visit evraffle.org tickets are just 200 and no more than 5500 will be sold so back in the day when sandy monroe was a frequent guest on this and we ended up hanging out at the ces in vegas the year the silverado ev was unveiled i asked him his thoughts on it and here's what he had to say now that we know what silverado is all about how do you think it compares it doesn't it's more expensive um and it's got less features and i think that ford is going to have a giant winner i really do um and i think the silverado is going to come in a sad second well actually not even second there's other ones that i i think are better than that too now that that um now what is the menu term for that oh yeah bullsh and sandy should have known better unless he didn't bother reading a press release from that day at that time the starting price was actually exactly the same for both trucks the specs were favoring the silverado ev in most categories and definitely in the most important one the range so for those of you who have been asking me why sandy has not been invited back for a while now well this is why and don't get me wrong i bow to him on his manufacturing expertise but his commentary on the common things in the industry was becoming more and more delusional and flat out and correct and the reason for that i believe was not something that i ever tolerate on my the truth is and i hope sandy is watching the silverado ev is just a much better offering than and the f-150 lightning i will tell you why it's better than the f-150 lightning but i will also tell you why it's most likely going to be a better of an electric truck than the cyber truck as well so as sandy likes to say gather around boys and girls the silverado ev will have the official epa range of over 450 miles that is better than they have originally announced and is much better than ford's 320 miles now let's be very clear we are only talking about the work truck version that is reportedly already in production and that's the only silverado ev model i'm going to talk about since all other version specs have not been finalized or even announced i just don't trust gm with anything that they say unless it's already in production and even then i know of at least 2k cases where that doesn't really mean anything if you compare the silverado ev work truck to the similar version of the f-150 lightning which is the pro currently on a temporary hold which is annoying you can see that for pretty much at the same price the silverado ev is a much better truck including yet another important ev spec the max dc fast charging where the silverado ev is kicking lightning's booty by more than double though to be fair it does have a bigger battery and it can power a work site for twice as long plus if you ask me it's a much better looking truck not that it matters in this case it actually looks similar to what i think a lot of us thought the tesla cyber truck was going to look before you know the whole these are the specs that the cyber truck will have to compete with but guess what there is more as a result of the recent deal between gm and tesla which i still can't wrap my head around the silverado ev should have access to pretty much all supercharger locations in addition to all electrify america and evgo locations on top of all that the silverado ev will feature the bi-directional charging allowing you to run a work site or power a house which at this point doesn't seem the tesla cyber truck will be able to do oh and by the way just in case if you haven't noticed the forty thousand dollar starting price much with the lightning is gone it does have some shortcomings as well no home backup power system ford has the shorter bed and what a lot of people criticize he huge and not very efficient battery now i have always dismissed that criticism as you know the new manufacturing term you are now familiar with because at the end of the day customers don't care about it they only care about practical things the range the price the charging while they don't care about the chemistry of the battery cells just you don't care about the very smartphone that you're probably holding on to right now do you know it's specs or efficiency or the chemistry do you you see what i'm going with this but i would say the biggest shortcoming of the silverado ev is that the regular customers you and me will have to wait for a year to be able to buy a consumer version of the truck so the stage is set all i can tell you is that we've started this year with two electric trucks on the market and will finish it with twice as many let me know which one you fancy in by the way if want to know why i think letting gm and ford use tesla's charging port in the entire tesla supercharging network was quite stupid for tesla you can check out this right here and i will explain alright looking forward to all of your comments other than that see you guys next time and remember to stay charged,3
E for Electric,PLXAbfWOvf5Ytlrxe40n0F7dGvWkqRpHM1,RyeCae8s7Lk,biggest news of the year so far for tesla may just be its worst it's just no one knows it yet and in case you haven't heard gm and ford have come crawling to tesla crying oh we don't have anywhere for our customers to charge and we didn't build our own charging network can we pretty use yours and instead of saying hells no people buy our cars a lot because of our great supercharger network and we're not gonna just get rid of our biggest advantage sheesh instead of saying that they said yeah why not you can use it and you know what you can even start selling your own cars with our charging port and of course all of the tesla fans have praised the deal by the supreme leader saying uh look at how much money tesla is going to make on all the ford and gm evs charging at superchargers and paying tesla money but what they're forgetting is that tesla has already committed to making 7500 superchargers at pretty much all locations available for not just ford and gm but all evs out of the goodness of elon musk's heart i'm just kidding here doesn't have one it was for the sweet sweet taxpayer money from the infrastructure bill and don't get me wrong the tesla connector is about and i did the math a million i came up with a million times better than the ccs one but do we really want such an important standard controlled by just one automaker well to answer this and many other questions about this deal i will be joined by the industry's leading expert on ev charging and the host of the state of charge youtube tom maloney but before that a quick reminder that this is brought to you by ckn action fund one of the nation's best non-profits fighting climate change just launched yet another ev raffle you could win in lucid air with a 500 mile battery or a rivian suv plus 10 years of free charging or a tesla model x the second action fund that one ops itself every year with these raffle prizes while using the proceeds to promote clean energy for complete terms and to enter the raffle visit evraffle.org tickets are just two hundred dollars and no more than 5500 will be sold all right tom uh let's get something out of the way is there a consumer alive right now who would prefer the you know the bulky ccs plug over the sexy easy to use come to mama tesla plug yeah i don't think so alex unless maybe you worked on the sae board that designed j1772 and you think it's your baby other than that there's really no advantage and i don't see why anybody would prefer it over the uh the nax connector it's a very ugly and fat baby for sure all right but this is where uh the whole deal stops making sense to me because obviously this is great that we're going to be moving to to that plug i liked it so much better just everybody else but what is tesla getting out of this i that that they weren't going to get in the next couple of years with with the infrastructure bill can you explain that to me well you know i think tesla's playing the long game with this alex and initially they might not really be benefiting but it is a benefit to the company down the road when there's tens of millions of electric vehicles and everybody is using one connector their connector uh the the they there's a lot of money to be made with people accessing using their supercharger network and them basically charging them for the energy no i get it yeah but they're going to achieve that and they can't achieve it at any time they've already started converting their uh or adding the magic dog as as a scold where people of four gm and any other ev uh can charge at the supercharger why make a deal with these two manufacturers because that's introducing an adapter and it's a you know it's it's actually a pretty elegant solution the way they did it i've charged on the magic dock i've charged my lightning on the magic dock superchargers but it's only adding another element of cost another layer of something that can break those are going to break eventually with people pulling them in and out putting them in incorrectly maybe even stealing them so you know it's it's adding it would it's going to add a lot of cost and complexity to the superchargers and it's unnecessary if they can just have people use the next all right but there is no at least in the next couple of years it's just no benefit for tesla besides getting more people to their with the magic docs it's just it's just a cosmetic improvement right well we don't know really what's going on behind the scenes the the fact that the other major oems in north america are switching over to the next connector might mean that it opens up even more federal funding with the navi funds for tesla we we don't this is so early we don't really know exactly how it's going to play out alex but it is a very good long-term move for the company and look at look what happened to their stock so it's it it has paid so much immediate dividends this is why i don't talk about stock on this stock never makes sense to me in generally but it has nothing to do with consumers i don't care about tesla investors what i care about is you know ev consumers and you know this is good for the av consumers as we agree in the beginning but you know is this good for tesla uh drivers because you know we've talked about it a while back when tesla uh you know was committed to retrofitting you know what up to 7 500 um or or making the 7500 uh charging stations where you can charge your car with ccs uh port um you know but that means that there will be more and more and more people using tesla superchargers uh and every time i talk to a tesla i don't even have to talk they talk to me in the comment section right and their point is i chose tesla because and number one reason ever almost every time is not the car itself but the supercharger network now they are going to lose that advantage so and anybody can buy any car any any electric car and use the supercharger network so uh is this is this going to damper you know know the experience for tesla the current tesla driver and future trend tesla drivers yeah i mean i i don't see how it's a good for tesla drivers uh the only way you could say is as i went as i said earlier long game it's going to be more revenue for tesla and down the road you know the more profitable the company is maybe they can sell vehicles at a lower cost or maybe they can just continue to install more supercharger locations at a breakneck speed they've been and uh and and and have more sites that will help ease the uh overcrowding that could happen once everybody can use the stations but no the clean and simple answer is i don't think it's good for tesla owners i don't think it's terrible for them but it's definitely not a good move for them all right well that's that's i guess where i always have a problem when something is bad for tesla owners even though a lot of them involved with it but all right but you know isn't tesla how sweet is the money that that tesla's going to receive because of this uh for them because i'm sure they know to remove the biggest advantage that that their own uh drivers their own customers uh brag about which is the supercharger network i mean isn't isn't this going to really drive uh some of the consumers uh to other brands where before that they didn't consider it but now we can buy a ford and gm or whatever and use the supercharger network yeah well for sure you know i've i've even had you i've had my followers tell me i really wanted to get the mustang maki for instance or ionic 5 but the public charging experience is so lacking that i ended up buying a model y because i know i could just get where i need to go and uh now that those vehicles will have access eventually you know through an adapter at least the the ford will natively um it's going to uh make it a little bit more difficult to sell the teslas but evidently tesla feels they can hold their own and their vehicles are good enough to compete even if you remove that exclusivity that they had which was the supercharger network tesla must feel our vehicles can can can can hold their own against the competition even if the charging is all on a level playing field a tesla can feel however they want to feel but their customers feel that that's a big advantage so okay we'll see i i think for you know for next few years every ev that's made except for the honda e and the mazda whatever they just it's going to be sold uh before it it comes off the production line but um but let me ask you this do you think it's good that one brand you know that hasn't been that you know friendly to consumers sometimes and to definitely their competition not that they should be um control such an important part of uh ev ownership as the charging standard you know it is isn't isn't isn't that going to be a problem yeah so um that is a bit of a problem uh we we don't know exactly how all this is going to play out alex i know i've said that before but the truth of the matter is we don't um it's it's not good for one company to control it it's not really technically a standard if one company just controls it what hasn't been you know reviewed and and uh had other people involved making decisions uh which sometimes that's a good thing but moving forward once all the manufacturers have adopted the knacks and i believe they all are going to eventually uh you know i would it would be really good to see some sort of a a a a board where you know it's it's it's it's everybody has some skin in the game and it's not just tesla controlling this now i have faith that ford and gm would not have negotiated with tesla and accepted that connector and put it on their future vehicles if they weren't assured somehow certainly that tesla wouldn't be a bad actor in this you know get them to all switch over to nax and then you know put on some kind of crazy strict rules and change things that were advantageous for them these big companies you know go through layers and layers of lawyers and and i have to believe that this has all been discussed in that at some point uh there'll be other people that will be involved with uh the the nax connector to make it say a proper standard now let's talk about ford and gm i mean do you do you see this deal as a a an admission of borderline embarrassing defeat no not at all uh and it's a little perplexing to me when i see that uh people commenting that it's not ford and gm made ccs and said this is what our connector is this is what you know the the this is what we're going to use because we developed it they didn't that was what was available to them when when tesla when ford and gm started making the their electric vehicles they couldn't use the tesla connector they weren't allowed to so you know wait a second but but but you're pretending they they they they don't have any money you know i mean these companies have plenty of money they definitely had more money that tesla had when they started the supercharger network right of course why couldn't they've won you know each of them at least try to to create one of their own but really uh bond together and create a network for for the ccs standard i mean they haven't even tried so you mean accept the ccs standard but then then they create the network build out the infrastructure i wasn't sure what you're asking yeah yeah absolutely what tesla did i did make the right i feel it yeah no i feel it's so easy for these companies to to compete with tesla because tesla has pioneered pretty much everything and all they have to do is copy them and they can't even do that they can't even copy someone else's homework well i think what it comes down to is they don't want to they they don't want and i've had conversations with so many different oems over the last 15 years that i've been doing this alex and every single manufacturer comes back and says look we don't make gas stations we don't sell gas we're not in the business of selling fuel we're in the business of making vehicles then the customers get the fuel somewhere else and and and you you can argue with it let me finish let me finish you can argue that point and say it's a bad business decision now with electric vehicles because tesla's proving that it seems it's a good thing but that's the answer they don't want to get into the business of selling electricity volkswagen didn't want to do it either they were forced to with the with the with the fines because of the diesel gate well it's not an answer it's an excuse you know because it is definitely possible they had so much more money than them and now they have to admit the defeat that hey listen we could make it work uh we now have to go to our competitor bow to them and put essentially their you know creation into our crappy cars i don't mean traffic cars but you know what i mean into our crappy design that that didn't hold up and because we couldn't put together a charging network it's not their crappy design no because they didn't ford gm didn't say let's get together and make um you know the the the the the the ccs and j1772 connector uh you know it's not their thing failed that was what the standard was and that's why they put her on their vehicles um you know that's fine it's definitely not an admission we can't do anything the way i see it at least in my view is they're saying look we we're looking at the field of public charging and tesla has such a better charging experience we want our customers to have a better charging experience so we're going to adopt that connector there's no admission or failure that stuns me that's just that's such a weird logic you know it's with this google and android said well we couldn't figure something out so instead of figuring that out you know even though it was given to us we decided to go to apple and and and pay the money to uh well how do you know they paid the money how do you know if they paid the money or even not the pay the money well i mean soon listen there's obviously if you're going to be letting uh tesla you know using the tesla's another companies doesn't matter in other companies uh technology you're bowing down to them you're admitting the defeat that you guys couldn't figure it out and and you know but they weren't trying to figure out they weren't trying to make it a better connector they just want to make the cars they just want the cars to charge somewhere in a good listen easy for their customers they're not trying to make chargers connectors but they now but but listen the game has changed you know the game has changed tesla has given them 10 years to say listen this is what we're doing and with every day you could see tesla being more and more and more successful they they beat them in so many different ways i mean i don't to talk about stock but you know their most valuable a valued uh manufacturer right now they're model y is a best-selling uh amazing at what point i mean at what point do they go hey you know what those guys are doing a tesla we should probably try to do something similar and by the way they have so much more power because they're all using ccs port they can all create a a subsidiary or whatever a company that will kick superchargers network ass if they wanted to but the fact that they didn't that is admitting defeat if you ask me so yeah they could they could all let's say all the automakers said we're each going to put a billion dollars in a pot and and you know have 15 billion dollars and and and just go out there and install ccs charging everywhere they could do that you're right but that doesn't mean it's going to work better the the reason why they covet the tesla connector and the tesla charging experience alex is because it just works better it's a better standard the ccs standard is not a tightly written standard that people interpret it different i was just at the char and organization into our operability conference and and and i learned so much there basically what the engineers there told me was so because i asked them flat out well how why does we have why do we have these problems why does their interoperability issues how come the charges don't work and everything and they said basically the way the ccs standard is written when we build our equipment when we write the software we can either follow the ccs standard or we could make the equipment work we can't do both what the hell is that so basically you've got all these companies missing uh operating and it's admit writing software that violates the standard because the way the standard is written it won't work properly so why keep pouring money into this alex when you can just say look instead of using that standard there's another one over here that works it works great it's smaller it's lighter it's easier it's more elegant for people to use and it's proven that it works let's just use that one i don't care who designed it okay i mean of course you don't care i don't care either i'm rooting for this but i'm trying to figure out how these other companies allowed this to happen and by the way let's talk about those who actually did was there kind of a full-time job you know let's talk about electrify america let's talk about evgo uh let's talk about chargepoint that hasn't really even tried it you know i i you know i know people poop on electrify america a lot and i have used them pretty much exclusively uh in the last what seven months since i was traveling through the united states and using them exclusively until now um and uh you know it worked it at the end of the day it pretty much worked out every time but they are a freaking mess uh it is i i it just tells me how unorganized and and bad they are at building which i think is really not something that's very hard to build they're not doing brain surgery it's pushing freaking electricity into cars and i get it i know you're gonna say well there's a lot of cars and there's just one of us and there's all the vendors but make it freaking work have a zoom meeting have a zoom meeting and make it work the change the standard doesn't make sense you know update the standards you know what i mean there could be a second version of the standard how could what what happened to all of that how is that even people whose full-time job was to to make it work and they couldn't explain that to me because there's too many people involved the one thing that the reason why tesla works so easy alex is they controlled everything the software the hardware the chargers the cars with ccs what you have is 40 different manufacturers all writing so their own proprietary software for the cars and then you've got 40 different charging station companies writing their own proprietary software then you've got an overlay of the payment systems the credit card readers you've got the networks electrify america evgo charge point with their own software for their apps and all this software has to work and talk together come on alex you can say come on it's true there's yeah i've seen them doing their testing and everything it's hard i get it i know it's very hard but you know what i mean there's no other industry that has this problem and i'm in bangkok right now right i'm gonna go downstairs to you know a a guy who's selling you know hot dogs on a little card or actually i'm gonna or scorpions i saw scorpions on the stick yesterday you know what i mean and i'm still going to be able to use my american credit card in this tiny little street in in the middle of bangkok in my car is rita is going to freaking work here in bangkok how's this electrify america not able to figure this out well you know the the payment systems that you're talking with have had decades to improve and refine and make the system work this is all new the election has been installing charges for what four years now and they've had to go through a whole bunch of different vendors because half of them didn't work and the equipment was changed now it's version two equipment this is such in such infancy this industry it's not surprising when you have so many people involved all writing software to try to coexist with each other different layers of software that there's a problem if if we were 30 years into making ev dc fast charges and it's still what marcus alex you're right but this is we're so early on and i get to i get the opportunity to talk to all these engineers and they explain it to me and i i honestly half the stuff they're telling me i don't even understand but they're showing me why there's interoperability issues why charging stations drop why credit card uh you know processors don't work and things that so i understand there's a lot to do here and when you when you see all of the problems and how it doesn't work and then you look over here and you're well that one works really well and our customers will be so much happier if we could just use that doesn't surprise me that ford exam said you know what let's just use that damn thing it works i i don't accept any of that but all right i made my case obviously it's not it doesn't matter america from they don't care but okay one last question uh you know i think that you know by the time this this might air even though a few days after we tape it do you think other other uh brands other car makers will follow will and if so i'm gonna assume you're gonna say yes but if so will there be a limit for example well it's going to be rough for german automakers to do that obviously but what about chinese automakers what about you know other small automakers do you think everyone's just gonna adopt it or do you think it's just only going to be north america only or europe only what do you think is going to happen in the next you know few months to a couple of years okay a couple of things here first off this is north america only just so you know this where this is not going to happen anywhere else all the other read there is no global standard you know in china china they used the gbt and they're going to supposed to transition to chowjoy connector japan is solid ccs they may go to chowjoy but i don't even believe they're gonna i think not ccs chadamo um uh the japan's going to be chadamo you know for for forever i believe because that's so really well they have so many stations in my mouth a little bit when you said that the entire country is blanketed with chadamo you can you you can't throw a rock and not hit a chathamo station in japan alex you can go anywhere you want maybe they should switch a lot of rocks well they should but in any event that's the way it is europe has ccs but it's ccs2 it's different than what we have here i know charmin likes to say it's a global standard it's ccs it's totally different than the ccs we have here in north america rccs is much worse than the ccs to have in europe and and tesla uses ccs2 in europe because of the fact that the the european union mandated that it had to be used there had to be one standard third so they did that and now everybody uses that here in north america to get to your final question yes i believe that that's it once ford and gm switched over it is a fate of complete nax is going to be the north american standard i don't know how long it's going to take the other oems to come out but you're gonna the dominoes are gonna start falling now alex one afternoon after another what does that mean ccs is going away no she just is going to be here for a while kind of chathamo is still here you know and there's just the leaf uses chadamo and there's still chatamo stations everywhere there's going to be legacy ccs stations all over the place but i think by the middle of this decade 2025 2026 most of the evs that the new evs produced are going to have uh the nax connector as their native connector and that's what they're going to be using is that when electrify america chargers are all going to work well once they will have to adopt this no that that won't fix it because it's still a software problem with their charges the the connector itself just makes it a more elegant solution they still have to then make the payment systems and the whole uh back end the software work better and who knows maybe tesla will get involved and help them figure out how to make the software work because it seems to work fine on the superchargers when they're testing when they're using other vehicles i charge my ford now it hasn't been perfect so i think some of the kia and hyundai group vehicles have had some interoperability issues on tesla stations with the magic dock but um if for the most part they seem to work and service other evs that came up and use the magic dock systems pretty well all right well we'll see what happens but uh i'm gonna go and get myself some street food here in bangkok and i am going to charge my android phone with a non-apple charger and i'm gonna pay with a credit card and and enjoy the technological wonders outside of of a mess that is the car industry and the street food here in bangkok was delicious and if you wanted to find out what kind of food tom eats you should to his youtube which i can easily tell you is the best place on social media to learn about ev charging and if you want to know the dramatic and sad ending to my two year ownership of the volkswagen id4 and why and how i got rid of it to check out this with some interesting clips other than that see you guys next time and remember to stay charged,3
E for Electric,PLXAbfWOvf5Ytlrxe40n0F7dGvWkqRpHM1,uo5d-j6t418,people it really no cells this is a massive breakthrough [music] that were announced by tesla two years ago turned out to be a lie as they went into production but a tesla influencer and an investor warren redlick disagrees with me as he often does and i don't think you're correct whenever that happens we turn our cameras on and publish it on one of our channels it's my turn this time so let's get going but before that a quick reminder that this is brought to you by flow always reliable extremely durable the flow home is a level 2 ev charging station designed to make your life easier and is compatible with any ev in north america learn more about the flow home at flow.com and by new charge you can now charge two cars at the same time without spending a ton of money on rewiring your home all you need is the smart splitter from new charge get one today and use the discount code in the description of this alright now we've talked uh last time on this about you know whether or not fsd tesla's fsd a scam uh you know obviously we disagree that's why you're here we're not here to you know hug and and agree on everything that would be boring um the another thing that tesla has promised uh which again i i'm not sure if i would go as far as calling it a scam but it's close if you ask me it's kind of the same as the one with fsd is the 4680 batteries um so let me kind of you know start off by saying that you know no matter what happens with these it is once again tesla that's trying to make the step forward in yet another technology that technically is not their thing they make cars you know um this should have been catl that should have been samsung or panasonic right and yet they said on their asses then absolutely no progress i mean just minimal priorities it was once again tesla that said we're gonna try something new and they came up with this 4680 batteries right so you know every time i want to say the reason the women are talking about this is because tesla tried to make some progress here right uh so here's where once again my problem with tesla is that they promise something and they just don't deliver and the way they don't deliver is kind of hush-hush and let's talk about this 4680 batteries there were two uh benefits to them really three benefits to them uh one was that you know the chemistry of the anode another is chemistry of cathode and another one is just you know because they're bigger batteries the walls are going to be thinner and therefore um the uh the the energy density would be better and now that you know they've produced them uh and people sandy monroe one of the biggest tesla apologists and tesla fanboys i think he beats you even in that category he had to go and say oh crap none of that happened i mean none of that happened and you can easily see that the uh i think it was model y that started getting those batteries didn't get any really faster charging times didn't go any further with the same batteries so was are you are you disappointed what is the excuse here i think that uh the battery day presentation where they explained what 4680 was going to be maybe wasn't clear enough how long it was going to take to get there and it's clear now um drew baglino who's on the tesla team has explained that the targets they talked about on battery day were for 2026. that um and they i think that they are behind in terms of production i think they had hoped to be producing more 4680 cells at this point and that is one of the things that slowed up cyber truck and has slowed up tesla's growth um but i think and i think uh by the way i don't think the walls of the cell are thinner the walls of the cell are actually three times it's thicker the walls are then it should be because of their use in the structural battery pack but i think what we have to whatever well i think what we have to recognize is that this is engineering engineering you start with okay we have an idea and we think this is a really good idea and we do our first cut we come up with a protozoite then we come up with a pre-production pro with a pre-production uh version and then we start producing and what we've seen with tesla is the 2018 model 3 and the 2023 model three are very different vehicles that as they continue to iterate they continue to get better and better and better so a really good example is they talked about using dry battery electrode dry battery you know the dry cathode while the cathode facility is being built so currently i believe they are using a wet cathode i'm not 100 sure that um but they're building a cathode facility that's going to produce the materials that are needed for dry cathode i don't and i'm a little fuzzy on where exactly they are in that whether they're already using dry cathode but they're going to have more cathode material they're going to be able to do it but it's sort of number one you've got to figure out how are we going to make these things and you get to the point where you're making them in some volume at some reasonable cost because one of the goals is also to bring the cost down right there's a bunch of ways that this brings costs down if you do it right and it i don't believe they ever said it would charge faster i believe what they said maybe i'm wrong about that but the main benefit was we're able to accomplish more in a larger cell and they went to the largest cell they could to achieve a roughly similar charge and discharge rate if they if they did a smaller cell so the the fastest charging and discharging cell in a tesla is the 18650 the smallest cell that's in my model x right because you want that high performance so the larger cell isn't necessarily for high performance in terms of acceleration or fast charge it's for being able to serve as a structural pack it's for being able to manufacture at high volume at low cost i think people may have misunderstood battery day if they thought it was about performance it was about delivering a high volume of batteries at a low cost per kilowatt hour that was the primary function i'm i'm listen i totally understand that being first and pushing the boundaries takes time right and i'm i never have that issue with tesla or anybody right it it will take longer i mean even my contractor who's remodeling my condo here i know he will take longer okay but so that's not the thing it's always how what elon what he says right about how we oh yeah we're gonna it's gonna be tomorrow right and also then how they hide their failures it's okay to fail we talked about in the last right it's okay to fail that's how you succeed right your example of spacex uh boosters was great right there's a collage that elon musk posted at some point with all of the explosions to finally get that amazing shot of those two boosters landing perfectly at some point right so i totally get it but why do it in such a uh um sleazy way right it had to be sandy monroe and i think there was another uh a guy who did a a tear down to actually realize that what they promised by george jordan you see the limiting factor who did it yeah exactly sure why why not just say hey guys we are selling 4680 batteries they're not exactly where we where we're hoping they're gonna be but this is a first version this is what they can do this is the improvement and we are hoping to get that done in another two or three years oh yeah they're not they're not selling 4680 batteries they're selling model wise with 46.80 i get it i get it we're selling our product based on the 4680 680 model y are spelled out on the website no no i get it what i'm saying is that when you do this big presentation that the battery day was and then you end up not delivering or at least delaying your uh your product why not mention it uh somehow it doesn't have to be another big presentation obviously but it's it's almost somehow i feel they're just getting caught somebody caught them you know not actually having the chemistry to the promise actually caught them having thicker cells just their 2170s have where they could have just come out and say listen guys progress takes time and nobody would have blamed them for that drew baglino has said that i mean i i you know i listen to every investor call i listen to investor day that's a it's a very freaking question uh in the say technologies um you know there's this thing where you can submit questions to the for the earnings calls and they're asked probably more than half the earnings calls are asked about the progress of 46.80 and drew back we know always answers the questions and he's very straightforward about it and they've spelled out where they're at where they're going and i think they do feel that they're behind and i think a bunch of things happen let's not forget over the past few years there have been some disruptions in the global economy and the supply chain there have been issues if things that come up that made it hard to get work done you're missing my point by the way but first of all it's not be heard this information came from it didn't come from the earnings call it didn't come from the earnings calls it came from those teardowns that's when we first found out that what those 4680 cells have is nothing what they've promised so it wasn't upfront it was it didn't come from tesla it came from those people who actually did a tear downs i don't think that that at battery they'd said the battery day they said the first version of our battery will be x would be we'll have this energy density they said this is what they're going for long term um they they had a chart that showed you know the graph projecting out into the future um and i don't think you're correct about tesla hiding it or waiting until jordan giese did his tear down jordan didn't do the teardown jordan worked with shirley mong and she arranged for some lab and i think san diego to tear the battery down um there's never there's no expose there the battery isn't where they projected it would be a battery day because we're not in 2026 yet they're they're they're optim they're you know you you build your pre-production prototype then you build your your first production version and then you iterate you iterate and you iterate and that is the way the tesla works that's the way the spacex works that's the way the boring company works i'm guessing that's the way the neural link is going to work um the problem is that other companies don't do that other companies don't iterate in the same way that tesla does you can look watch joe justice talk about how much tesla iterates how many changes and sandy monroe has probably talked to you about how how many changes tesla makes constantly they're constantly changing the vehicles a vehicle you buy this month is that was built this month is different than a vehicle was built a month ago where you know with ford and general motors and volkswagen they make changes once a year or much less frequent changes yeah well we can argue about which one is better i mean i think it's also preference i prefer if they change it once a year but that's that's you know that's consumer preference but you know and but at the same time you know uh lucid ceo peter rollerson um came out pretty much shortly after that peter frodlinson what okay go ahead well listen you can call them names all you want but you turn out to be right and he is the one who actually was the only one who figured out how to make a car that goes further than tesla in your tesla and chargers faster than a new tesla so you got to give him some credit peter frodlinson is the guy who said that only tesla went through production hell that other car companies don't go through production hell he was wrong about that well let's listen we're not here to discuss him i'm just saying there's one guy no you just said that they made a vehicle that has more range if you cram a really ridiculously large battery pack in the vehicle and you lie about how many kilowatt hours are in the battery pack which they did right and you claim that no not right no they no i don't know what you're talking about there it's 138 kilowatt hour pack their initial filing with the epa was 138 kilowatt hour pack and then they retracted and said it was 118 kilowatt hour pack it's it's a 500 mile range because they crammed a lot of extra batteries in it that's it did somebody prohibit tesla from doing this no tesla doesn't need because tesla knows you don't need more than 400 miles of range well that's kind of funny because tesla said that they were going to come up with all kinds of cars with 500 miles of range so at some point they thought that would be the right number but listen let me let me rephrase it some guy that you guys all don't and i just don't wanna i don't want to really discuss that's that could be a different some guy who uh said that he uh that sounds a bunch of [ __ ] and then people sandy monroe what was what was rollinson's specific criticism she basically said it's it's better packaging rather than breakthrough chemistry that was very close to what he said he basically said it's great packaging and there's some some actual advantages to it but this is not a breakthrough chemistry technology so far i haven't implemented the first of all nmc 811 is a more advanced battery technology battery chemistry than nmc532 right you have more nickel versus cathode you know it uses less cobalt which is important and you have a higher ratio of nickel to manganese now there are actually some interesting progress with manganese and we may see some high density high energy density manganese cells in the future but uh you know the plan all along was and elon said this along the way that they expect to improve the chemistry as they go no listen i'm not i'm all good but that's not what sandy monroe said right sandy musroll and i quote not because i have it on tape but also because i was standing right next to him when he said it that that was crap right so and this is kind of goes to but it is crap because because it's not the chemistry that's in the cell today it's in the kits the chemistry that the cell will have in 2026. when when lucid motors is no longer in business when peter fraudlinson is off on some caribbean island making sure he stays away from saudi consulates this time i i i talk to you listen i'm not a lot of some concessions that your original estimation of lucid was wrong that you thought they weren't going in production right and they ended up going in production so i would i would say predictions are funny right but hey listen this is the guy who who thought that biden was going to make it right so i'm just saying we've all had a share of bad calls uh i was i was not i may have gotten the little bits and pieces wrong or lose it along the way i was not wrong about lucid they were a fraud from the beginning they're a fraud now i i don't think so but that again that's a different i don't mind making with you but uh listen let's let's talk more about the 4680s uh and then and there's another question i wanted to ask you just about the future you know because at this point 4680 is all everyone and their uncle is making them there's israeli company store dot that some people argue is actually doing a better job than even tesla and tesla's not even doing themselves it looks they're gonna actually continue their partnership with panasonic which actually i think was a great idea um you know uh these are much of an advantage to this uh that tesla really has when everyone else is doing that and maybe someone else will beat them to uh to this non-crappy 4680 battery well so first of all i believe panasonic is building 4680s in wakayama japan lg cam is building 4680s in korea and i believe lg cam is working on a factory to produce 4680s in the us and maybe panasonic has got a factory that's going up in kansas west of kansas city i think um so i do think that there are other companies listen tesla would be thrilled and i would be thrilled if other companies started making more batteries and tesla didn't have to make batteries that would be great so the practical reality is that tesla announced that at giga nevada they're going to expand production of basically a whole new set of 4680 cell production and giga nevada eventually reaching maybe 500 gigawatt hours a year and presumably they're going to scale texas to a larger amount of battery cell production um there's a real value in tesla producing their own batteries i i don't i think this idea that somebody has a better 4680 i i first of all i never heard of this dot company that you're talking about are they produce door dots are they producing in volume uh i i think they're starting to but again they have been in the news a lot and everybody is covering them hey this is a they might actually be tesla 2 the uh the actual promised land with no pun intended actually uh their israeli company 4680 80 batteries so they have actually been uh very steadily making progress towards volume production and i think they're starting it this year okay well tesla's already in some level of volume production of 46.80 and no one else is right well we just talked about how they're not really the 4680s that i mean the the the the size is 46.80 but it's not the chemistry that they originally promised what i'm saying is maybe it isn't this is a question to you they're the only ones making 4680s that are going in vehicles that are being delivered to customers panasonic will be delivering 4680s lg chem will be delivering 46 days i hope this israeli company delivers 40 cities there's only one customer for 4680s that's not the only customer if somebody else wants to make 4680s great that means tesla can make more cars i love it i want somebody i want everybody to make 4680 for tesla i have no point in this race i was just literally just kind of curious but okay let's talk about something else because you know uh 4680s is kind of the pony that that tesla has picked but it's the solid state batteries that kind of everybody else is chasing and it's kind of a consensus that while that's that's when we finally going to get to you know the charging times and the range that everybody really wants right so um you know and in 4680 is just kind of a stepping stone um do you think it's a mistake for tesla not to i mean it doesn't seem they're doing any r d on this or acquiring any companies that are doing solid state batteries you know could tesla lose this race to someone volkswagen group that's heavily investing into um into solid state battery technology um what are your thoughts on that sure um i think solid state is something that probably will happen in the next five or ten years my guess would be that tesla is doing research on solid state but it's not their highest priority i think solid state gets played up lot and it misses a key point that's the the 2170 cells in 18650 cells and the 4680 cells that tesla's using now they're also using the lithium iron phosphate prismatic cells and the other cells the the 4680 2170 and 1865s are all higher energy density than the lithium iron phosphate cells and you know what it turns out that the lithium-ion phosphate cells are good enough for cars they're not good for all car applications but they're good for a lot of car applications and they're really good for grid storage so the idea that you need solid state the promise of solid state is that's going to be higher energy density and the reality is that the energy density that we have is good enough so it's not bad to get better but the energy density that we have is good enough for the vast majority of applications that we need and getting some incremental improvement in energy density is going to happen anyway just because panasonic has been improving their energy density algae chem has been improving their energy density even catl is improving the energy density of lithium iron phosphate but the idea that there's this fantasy solid-state battery out there that's going to change the game the game has already changed if we if we don't improve let's be clear if we do not improve battery technology at all going forward if we're stuck with the existing 4680 2170 1865 and lithium iron phosphate if that's all we have we're still going to transition the world to sustainable energy and there's certain there's certain applications flying planes where higher energy density really matters and then the other challenge with solid state is not just can you make that battery it's can you make it add volume at low cost because if you make a battery that's got more energy density but it costs five times as much per kilowatt hour and you're not solving the problem because you need to be able to deliver cars you need to be able to deliver smaller cars to people who can't afford teslas today granted and listen i agree agree with you in terms of we are pretty much there as far as delivering the range that people need right to me honestly anything above 200 miles it's it's it's it's good enough for most people and yes we can still get to three four five probably six hundred um that game has been won i believe the game that electric cars have been losing from day one honestly uh is the uh refueling time right so the solid state uh uh technology is actually drastically improves that just drastically right so i think that's the game that that technology is supposed to win which is really the last game we're playing right that's the only last the stronghold that uh gas cars have over electric cars um and this is really even in uh just you know in terms of uh long long distance travel i want to tell you why charging time doesn't really matter number one i'm charging my car right now doesn't matter how long it takes to charge it's sitting outside my house while we're doing this conversation it's been charging the entire time we've been doing this conversation and i can't charge my i can't fill my gas car at a gas station while i'm doing a zoom call with you so the reality is all why when i go on a long road trip i just drove to southern tip of texas to watch the rocket launch and drove back when i go on a long road trip it does take a little bit longer because of that charging time when i have to stop to charge it a supercharger right that is true it does it takes longer to charge the car than it takes to fill a gas tank that is absolutely 100 true costs a lot less too by the way but overall over the course of a month let's say for the course of a year i spend less time charging my car that i would spend filling the tank because i can charge at home listen no one watching this this this this this uh doesn't know what you're talking about right everybody everybody knows this i wanted to get to a different point though the point that matters is that we're heading towards a world of robo taxis whether it's two years from now or five years or an hour ten years from now at some point we're going to get to a robo taxi world and when we're in a robo taxi world you're not going to care how long it takes to charge because the robotech is going to arrive and take you where you want to go and if you're going on a long enough trip that you need that the vehicle is going to need to charge it's going to stop somewhere and another robo taxi is going to pick you up and take you the rest of the way so you're not gonna have to wait at all so the the charging time issue is not an issue in a robo taxi world it's only an issue in a world where i'm driving my own car and we're heading towards a world where 95 of people don't bother owning a car i i think you're wrong in terms of people would want all people would want to use uber because i think for example people me i robotaxi or not i want my own space just i want my own home and my own bed i would want my space to you know the robot actually needs to be mine i think by then the uh there will be either a battery swap or you know long fast charging battery technology uh but right now right right now this is the biggest point of resistance because there are tons of people who own electric cars even me right right now i'm a digital nomad so i have to go and charge it somewhere the electric fire america station tons of people who live in apartment complexes have that problem right people still try to uber in their electric cars and that you know they do need to charge uh sometimes in the middle of their work day and then there's a bunch of examples i know we're in a transition period i get it but this is when we need everything we can uh to to to to get the rest of the world switched because at the end of the day you know uh i i saw huge difference moving from silicon valley uh california here to houston texas you know over there it just seemed everybody and their uncle had an electric car right here there's not that many electric cars man we have a way more work to do than we actually yeah you have buckies i i've heard of them i've never bothered yeah so i i i yeah you don't have a tesla see if you had a tesla and you were going to supercharge you'd go to the buckies and i think there's two buckies in the houston area that's the place you go when you want to supercharge i go to walmart because that's where free electrify america chargers are uh you know and even some of them are actually working so uh it's it's it's it's good times but um all right so what do you think um is what can what do you think is going to happen in the next three years and i'm not just talking about tesla where are we at with range uh and i don't mean lucid's range i mean just ever right now it seems you know unacceptable what you expect type of a range from an electric vehicle is 250 miles right in an acceptable charging time is about 30 to 40 minutes right where do you think we're going to be in three years hold on a second so first of all i have about 300 miles range model 3 and 330 miles of range my model x and i personally would to have a road trip for general daily life it's fine for road tripping i would to have more range i think 360 miles of range would be they're much better for road tripping just to be clear um and i think the charge time is a little confusing for people and it's one of these questions that you get how long does it take to charge and there isn't really a simple answer to how long does it take to charge right now it's taking hours to charge my car but i don't care because i don't need to pay attention to it when i pull up to a supercharger it depends if i arrive at 10 and i'm only charging to 60 percent then it might take 15 minutes but if i've arrived at 20 i want to go to 90 it might take you know 40 minutes and if i'm at 150 kilowatt charger versus 250 kilowatt charger i would say on average a charge takes 20 minutes in my in my experience driving a tesla a charge on average a supercharge takes 20 minutes so dropping that to 15 minutes is not a big deal and i'm not convinced by the way that that solid state is going to charge that much faster oh it will it just of course it will because if anything solid state brings to the table is the fact that it's uh it has much less resistance so it doesn't heat up as well because you know the speed of charging is not about how fast we can push the electricity into the battery it's whether or not we can keep it from you know uh catching on fire because it's so hot right no it's whether you degrade the structure of the cathode when you cram the electrons in too fast well that's after it doesn't catch on fire but the problem is the cooling of the battery when you're charging right that's the number one thing the battery temperature at least on a tesla the battery temperature is not an issue the issue is that as the battery gets so if you're charging from 10 to 50 it's really fast it's when the battery starts to get full that it starts to slow down and the closer you get to full this is something that they discussed at battery day that drew baglino talked about the bookshelf and whatever this stuff is that the number of spaces for the electrons to fit into gets fewer and fewer and fewer and it gets harder to cram the electrons in so you have to slow down and i don't know i'm not saying you're wrong i'm just saying what i know of solid state batteries i'm not sure that that solves that problem the space levels is the cathode going to somehow be able to accommodate a faster rate of of electrons coming into the cathode and you know my gut hunch is the reason tesla is not at least publicly pursuing a solid state is because solid state is a dead end they figured out already that they don't that they don't need solid state that it you know if it had if somebody comes up with a great solid state solution then tesla will buy them or they'll just buy batteries from them yeah it could be but i mean the the leader in that technology right now is quantum scape and they're pretty much owned by volkswagen group and it will they will not sell it to tesla they'll first try to obviously power all the volkswagen i think porsche is going to be first in line obviously but all right let me ask you another question that's that we can we don't need to have agree on pretenses uh when do you think the 4680 batteries are going to be delivered the way they were taughted during the battery day so i think that the the ultimate you know 4680 that's more than 300 watt hours per kilogram um that's a a more advanced chemistry you know with dry electrode and dry you know dry cathode or whatever i think that's probably i think they're gonna i think the you know they'll get really close to what we were talking about by 2026 if not further and they'll continue to optimize after that i think the bigger question that people don't realize it's not about whether it's the right chemistry whether whether the chemistry is or the right performance it's it's manufacturing those cells in volume so that they can make more vehicles and you know keep in mind the ira tax credit and the advantages that that provides and as they scale production of 4680 is a giga texas over time as they produce more batteries it lowers the cost per battery because you've got the capital expenditure is amortized over a larger number of batteries so from an accounting perspective in other words the cost of the batteries comes down so the really big issue is not when do they deliver some you know exotic chemistry that makes the the vehicle perform that much better the really big question is when do they produce at scale and and my understanding is they've got one line running in giga texas now and they've got three lines getting ready to be commissioned so probably before the end of this year they're going to be producing a much higher volume and that's what the vine the volume of production matters a lot more because tesla just needs more batteries yeah no that that i agree with look at that we actually ended up agreeing on something that's not how we planned it but we have disagreed much more in our previous debate about whether or not the f and i'll let you guess which one of us took which side but you can watch that right here i'm looking forward to all of your comments well maybe not all of them to most of your comments other than that see you guys next time and remember to stay

should probably tell you how we went from well this if you have watched his before don't watch it again two having him on this show well so when i saw that cleverly titled e4 idiot i thought i would give warren a quick spelling lesson and invite myself to explain to him live on his why he was um what's the it's a medical term uh oh yeah full of and to his credit he accepted that led to not just one but two live debates uh with wonderful moments this you go to the bathroom really fast you just pee at the side of the car do you walk into the gas station restroom to pee i wear diapers actually just you know when the long trips warren that's how i roll i don't want to miss it nice nice hey you put two middle-aged men in one room sooner or later we'll be talking about our bladders so today we're having yet another debate this time on this for the first time actually and we're gonna be talking about whether or not tesla's full self-driving beta is a scam so let's get to it but before that a quick reminder that this is brought to you by neo charge guess what the 220 outlet that powers your dryer can now be split to also power your electric car with the help of this smart splitter

warren who would have thought uh i'm having you as a guest on my how did we get here i think we see some things the same way and some things differently and we're a good match in that way yes yes i wish we didn't start by uh one of us calling another idiot but however fate brought us together uh okay all right listen um we're not here to talk about our feelings we're talking let's talk about an actual uh issues and today we're going to talk about the full self-driving beta uh which tesla has had out for a few years um now this is something that uh well let's start with things that we probably agree on so you tell me if you agree with this i think that tesla is actually doing it the right way right they're doing it as an ai concept where any tesla should be able to drive pretty much anywhere as long as the technology knows what what the signs mean and stuff that right um where even though you know cruz and waymo um are ahead in some ways for example you just you can hire waymo taxi in california arizona there will be no driver behind the wheel it will be very futuristic but you know they're using 3d maps um and it's it's it's it's it's very contained to that area um and others uh ford and uh gm um you know they're they're they're definitely behind in many ways uh so you know do we agree on that that the way to do this correctly is the way tesla is doing it right now i i mostly agree with you i don't agree that waymo is futuristic i wrote in a waymo and i did not mind it to be futuristic but yeah i think i think the we drive cars with two cameras and biological neural nets and the solution to driving is cars drive with cameras more than two cameras and digital neural nets i think that makes sense it may make sense to add some kind of high definition radar at some point um there may be some other uh things that will help but i fundamentally i drive fsd beta i just drove fsd beta home today i think it's very very good it's not there yet but it's very good and it's it sees the road it sees the road it understands things just chat gbt understands things that seems to understand things the car seems to understand what's happening on the road now before we get to you know vision only you know lighters and radars you know let's talk about you know you just mentioned well they're not there yet right um i guess this is where i have a big problem because to me you know when tesla community sees brands offering something and then not delivering on that they call it a scam but how's tesla not doing very much the same thing they have i mean when i say they you know elon has consistently promised you know that this is going to be full self-driving it's called full self-driving um in you know they are accepting money it's up to fifteen thousand dollars right now and yet they have not delivered the product or given people a refund how is this not a scam so uh i bought fsd beta twice now um or i bought fsd twice i have fsd beta on two different cars um i feel much safer it's not it's not a robo taxi yet but i've driven 40 000 miles in my model x and the vast majority of those miles i've drove on fsd and i feel much safer knowing that fsd is driving my car and i would add to that um on the previous car which my younger child now drives my older child my older daughter um where i was going with her to see my mother and i got tired and i asked my older daughter to drive and i asked her to have fsd beta drive in her supervised fsd beta and i felt much safer with fsd beta driving and her supervising that i would have felt with her driving so i think people underestimate the value of fsd as it is now it is it is a it's something that makes cars safer as it is yeah but that's not what we were really talking about right it's for example if i go to a bar and order a lemonade and the bartender gives me water i go whoa whoa i ordered amoled but he's well but i just got you hydrated it is a liquid it is a liquid it is better than being you know dehydrated but it's not what i'm paying for i should pay zero dollars for water well but you just charged me five dollars for lemonade so i'm not arguing whether or not it's better than nothing i'm saying that if you're charging you know fifteen thousand dollars for something and you've continuously promised that this is going to be something uh in one or two years and then people end up you know uh ending their leases without getting what they paid for how is this okay okay so let's clarify something the people who paid fifteen thousand dollars that wasn't five years ago right the price okay but the understanding look when i bought it i had the understanding it'll be it'll be genuine full self-driving robo a taxi at some point we don't know when elon is very no no we did know when because elon told us that no no but when you went to the website to buy the car and you were you were buying the option it's fully disclosed on there this is beta software this isn't ready yet we don't you know it didn't say on the website when you are buying it it's going to be ready next week right it didn't it didn't it didn't the promise wasn't there was elon over optimistic and when he thought they would achieve you know robo taxi sure but you know he he turns the impossible into late so the practical reality is they are the safest cars on the road and i buy fsd knowing that it may or may not happen while i don't because i'm going to sell my model x in august and i'm probably not going to have uh rubble it's not probably not gonna be a robo taxi by the time i sell it i'm selling it and there's a whole long story behind that but uh i don't that doesn't bother me the practical reality is i've driven 40 000 miles and i've been safer for all 40 000 miles and there was there i've had incidents where my car saved someone's life had a couple of times where my car saw somebody i didn't see guy stepped out from behind a hedge and and my model 3 stopped and i didn't know why i was stopping i was about to hit the accelerator pedal and then i saw him so we saw the guy half a second before i did so uh you're correct that it's not everything that was promised or that everything that we were told it would be i don't know if promise is the right word but what happened promise is the right ward because elon promised and i think people believe the ceo of the company i don't think promise is the correct word for what he said i think he was optimistically saying this is what we think we're gonna do i don't think he said i promise you it'll be ready next week i think he projected that they would do it but i don't think it was ever a promise his statements have always been well i don't know they've always actually been this is going to happen we're going to have robo taxes and that's how he justified the price and consistently raising the price of these cars no no no no the value of robo taxi is way more than fifteen thousand dollars the value of robo tax is easily a hundred thousand dollars if you're willing to outsource your uh car for example most of us are not willing to do airbnb with our apartments and houses on the weekend so that does not raise the value of the house right so i think that's a kind of a false pretense let's address that point um if you are not willing to put your car out as a robo taxi and someone else is and it's worth a hundred thousand dollars to someone else then you can sell your car for a hundred you can sell your car for the value of the car plus a hundred thousand dollars and you can buy a car that doesn't have the feature right you can buy a a mustang machi or whatever ev you want to buy or you can buy a gas car you can buy a horse if you don't want to own you can buy a flip phone if you don't want a smartphone you're not nobody's forcing you to hold on to it if you don't if you don't buy it because because i bought them because i'm expecting there's a there's a you'd call it a call option you know there's a there's a possible a probability that it's going to achieve this level and it's going to start producing massive value right and so i'm holding my model 3 uh till the end of time until robo taxi comes because i believe that the robo taxi will happen and that will make that car extremely valuable for my model x it's just time to get move on from the model x that's a long conversation but um i think that people who are buying fsd um i don't know why the the whole idea is that you're paying 15 000 now because you think it's gonna be worth 100 000 later and if if you think it's only gonna be worth fifteen thousand later then you shouldn't have bought it now well yes that's actually i just made a short earlier today where you know if you're giving money to uh uh you know nigerian prince at this point that's kind of your your own fault so because i had a lot of you know followers saying oh i can't believe it i bought it and it didn't get delivered when did you buy it a year ago a year ago we all knew it wasn't going to happen so there's also some responsibility on people who actually paid the money i don't think nigerian prince is a fair comparison they are the safest way i actually think it's exact analogy where somebody promised you something and takes the money and does not give it to you so that the nigerian prince doesn't give you anything at all when you buy a tesla you get the safest car in the road you get the most efficient car in the road you get the coolest car in the road you get the most fun car on the road when you buy something from a nigerian prince you get nothing that's why it's not a fair comparison well we're not talking about the car we're talking about the actual fsd package which is not everything your appearance prints only sells you a fraud and when you buy fsd you get the safest driving software on the road you it makes your car your car is already the safest on the road to crash but it's the car least likely to crash as well it is to me it's the same as not having fsd to me if i have to keep my eyes on the road and hands on the wheel to me i call it and call me crazy driving so to me the value is still exactly the same whereas if i didn't have it wait do you ever take your eyes off the road once in a while i do of course you never get distracted you never get sleepy once in a while yeah okay well so that's when it's really valuable when it's really valuable is when you got distracted and the car didn't when it's really valuable is when you get sleepy and this happened to me once i was driving to california and i was in a long dead stretch of roadway and i started nodding off i didn't fall asleep but i was really on the edge of it and the car kept going straight the car saved the car kept me alive um i think well i think that if you don't appreciate the value that it delivers in being able to keep you safe then i don't maybe you don't value your safety well we go back to the same you know lemonade of the water i said that bartender who gave me water when i paid for a lemonade did hydrate me so i kind of should be happy that i didn't pass out for dehydration but i paid for the lemonade and that's called a scam when you're getting you're not getting something you paid for so you know but i think where we are disagreeing here is that whether or not uh it was promised right when when they see overcome to me when i see over the company says hey we're coming up with this feature we're going to he announced the price we're going to raise the price and this is what you're going to get to me it's a promise when a ceo of the company promises and charges money for it i should not uh even uh you know blink my eye and and i can go and get it uh going back and say well but in the in a small print it said that you know don't trust elon musk and i'm going to give you a different analogy you ordered a cheesecake and it was supposed to come with whipped cream on top you got the cheesecake it's the best damn cheesecake you've ever had in your life but the whipped cream isn't there okay you can complain about it you still got this i paid fifteen thousand dollars for the whipped cream and it's not there then it's going to be big problem because it's not you're paying fifteen thousand dollars for entire car fifteen thousand dollars is just to get the upgrade no no the the car and the safety that fsd gives you is the cheesecake and the robo taxi is the whipped cream the only thing you're not getting is the robo taxi feature and you don't want to use it as a robo taxi anyway so why do you care because if i'm paying money for a full self driving again call me crazy i would this car to full self drive period anything less than that i want my money back just i want my money back for that lemonade that actually was water but you know when you go to the tesla website and you're clicking that you want to get fsd it very clearly discloses not in small print that is not there yet and that these features will be unlocked at some point in the future and if you don't rather if you if you're about to spend fifteen thousand dollars you know read the simple text right in front of you then yeah you're right but that's not a nigerian prince the nigerian prince doesn't tell you it's not ready yet the nigerian prince tells you you know i'm going to send it to you tomorrow i'm going to send it to you right now so let me ask you this and this is another part of why i think it just looks a scam you know a few years back tesla community uh was very harsh or nicola motors uh because they have showed their truck rolling down the street and said look at that and it turned out to be that they staged it it was fake and everybody in tesla community yelled see that's a scam now tesla now that we know because you know they got they get sued a lot for this and they had to do their positions and the director of autopilot i believe a tesla uh admitted that one of the videos that i put out which by the way is still on their website was a fake where they have used the 3d maps where they actually interfered a human interfered and then it also ran into a wall i believe at the tesla's parking lot and yet they've passed this as fully self-driving that's another thing that made me think that's kind of a scam and i'm only using the the sort of the logic from tesla community can you explain that i don't know which you're referring to all i can tell you is i drive my car and my car does pretty much what every of those videos shows every day the is on tesla's website it demonstrates i don't know which one you're free what i'm saying is my car i've seen tesla videos showing the car doing full self-driving i don't know which one you're referring to okay one of them one of them my car does that every day what it shows in the my car does that every day so why fake it i mean you know what i mean why fake something that's working i don't know about the fake you're talking about what i'm doing well i just explained to you and by the way this is something that came out from the deposition and one of the trials i think it's between tesla and apple uh reported by reuters and many many other media where it's just taken right there it you know they they interviewed him and the guy said you know sorry we faked it we weren't gonna tell you until you forced us into so then the question is i'm sure if it means if reuters said it it must be true well they well if no if the director of autopilot at tesla said it it must be true that's what i'm saying reuters just reported what they read in the court filings right sir reuters would never misrepresent what they read they would never do something wrong you can prove all of us wrong but it sounds to me that's what exactly happened and we can go back and look but i think you're gonna lose this one if you're gonna go and look there there's too many people who reported it and it's a publicly access document here's the thing i drive fsd all the time and it does what they show in the videos all the time it's not perfect it does some things i don't it slows up for flashing yellow lights sometimes it doesn't choose the lane i wanted to choose sometimes it's not as aggressive as i would doesn't crash and it takes me from point a to point b it's pretty damn good the other sort of a problem that i had with you know elon and tesla pushing this is that publicly they pushed it as oh we're almost there it's literally just around the corner but when they have to report this to dmv right because dmv actually the one that oversees and gives them permits every time they talk to the dmv they argued hey guys this is a level two uh we're not even we're nowhere to close level three or one over four don't judge us we have nothing to do with this this is completely on the driver don't you think that's also a bit dishonest when you report when you have to report facts to dmv you report it as level two but when you're on twitter trying to sell fifteen thousand dollar package all of a sudden it's fully self-driving don't you think those two should be closer i don't think tesla has represented that's level four and first of all i don't i don't the level representations i don't think tesla has said this level four software they've said that they're um they're trying first of all there's this level two three four five whatever set up that the society of automotive engineers has and i don't think that's really irrelevant that that was something that somebody created years ago before we really got close to where we are today and what i would say is there's two levels that are coming that we're not at yet one level that's coming is when the car you have to stay in the driver's seat but you don't have to pay attention anymore you don't have to touch the wheel you're allowed to use your phone and you only have to take over when the car says hey i need you to take over now that's that's a level that's coming maybe by the end of this year and you know it's elon time so okay next year and then once it crosses that threshold the next level is you can sit in the back seat or no one has to be in the car so whether and the thing is level four level five that's sort of a level four sort of well it does everything but only in certain places and i don't think that's a relevant concept it's either it's gonna be it's going to get to the point where you don't have to pay attention until the car tells you you have to pay attention and then it's going to get to the point where you don't have to be in the car at all i don't think that that concept really makes sense but the liability issue that you're talking about tesla can say it's a level two and we're not responsible the driver's responsible but i was a plaintiff's lawyer for years and if i thought that tesla was at fault for the accident i would sue tesla anyway and if i persuaded a judge that tesla was at fault for the accident and this does happen from time to time then tesla is going to be held liable this is another reason why this level's distinction doesn't really make sense if there is some software in the car or some hardware in the car that causes a crash then the manufacturer is responsible not the driver so if it causes a crash then tesla's on the hook so that's another reason why this level two level three level four distinction but you know tesla has to deal with regulatory compliance so they're submitting some document to some dmv you know they got some lawyer who's filling out some paperwork and they fill it out a certain way that doesn't mean that they're not achieving very close to a genuine full self-driving car that you no longer have to supervise they're close is it is it six months away is it two years away i don't know we'll see let's talk about you know what would we actually started to talk about in the beginning you know tesla went with vision only right they say you know if a human being can drive with just eyes we can drive whatever now i thought it was by the way an awful analogy because you know 40 000 people died just in america with that so i feel we need more than eyes um what's your view pun intended i guess on you know tesla saying we don't need no stinking you know radars and lidars and the technologies that actually literally can see through rain and and and darkness we're just gonna go with uh cameras um do you and i mean at this point do you really think that was the right call yes uh i think people don't fully understand what's going on so for starters i drive with two cameras that are always looking in the same direction my tesla drives with eight cameras that are looking there's three cameras that are looking straight ahead there's two cameras looking from the side straight ahead two cameras looking inside looking back in one camera in the rear plus a camera watching me to make sure i pay attention so the tesla has the 360 degree view 24 7. i only have a very limited um view when i'm driving the car second um the advantage is in addition to that having the 360 degree view is the car doesn't fall asleep the car doesn't have a medication error the car doesn't get drunk the car doesn't get distracted by the girl in the bikini i get distracted by the girl in the bikini me too all the time but neither does a lidar or a radar we're not we're not arguing that that you know no that's a dress that way so let's address the lidar radar point so i drive without lighter and i drive without radar you drive without lighter you drive without radar the problem with lidar is it's very expensive it's not expensive when you more that argument only worked five years ago it's 400 right now and you know you can spare that out of fifteen thousand dollars that you're charging for this thing and they're getting cheaper and cheaper they're no longer you know spinning on top they're literally solid state you can have one or two they are quite inexpensive now okay so what i all i know is what i saw when andre carpathy talked about lidar he said they were able to use cameras and he talked about this concept called pseudo lidar and they were able to determine that the cameras alone were able to achieve everything that lidar was able to achieve now radar is a different story because lidar doesn't see through fog any better than the car than the cameras do lidar is the same light but the radar there's some theory that the radar can see through some things the problem with radar is it's a noisy signal and i don't know how much your viewers can grasp this concept but if you're what if you went back to an old the old days of television and you're trying to tune in or the old days of radio and you're trying to tune in a radio station you're not right on the station you're hearing this crackling noise and you're kind of hearing the radio station coming through that's a high that's not a high signal when you hit it right on the spot you've got a high signal to noise ratio the signal is what you want to hear and the noise is the stuff that's a distraction that keeps you from hearing what you want to hear so the problem with radar historically has been that it's a lot of noise and not a lot of signal and so for example we had a lot of phantom braking problems that were primarily caused by radar and that the trying to bring together the radar signal with the camera signal the cameras are not a noisy signal they're they're a reliable high signal to noise ratio system the the radar just didn't add value and when they took the radar out the cars continued to perform well and in fact perform better so there is a rumor i don't know if it's more than a rumor that tesla is going to add in a new radar called hd radar high definition radar i don't know whether that's going to happen or not um my own take is what i'm seeing is the car is driving extremely well without having radar or without using i think my car is still low set radar but without using radar and without using lidar so the question is what value does lidar add and you know i don't know the cost issue that you're describing i don't know how long the lidar lasts i don't know whether it lasts 100 000 miles or a million miles i don't know how much energy it uses i don't know how much complexity it adds i don't know how much value it adds to the car making decisions because what's happening is the car is hold on a second hold on hold on first of all i can answer that question but let me also address a couple of things you said you said you know okay well how much value does lighter add okay so you know we've we've all seen those issues where uh a camera is not able to sometimes understand if the stop sign is an actual stop sign or it's a stop sign on a billboard i think it's the most famous example where lidar would be easily be able to one determine the distance to determine the the the actual shape so that's just one of many ways how lidar does not determine shape of course again determine shape because it will give you a 3d digital map of what's in front of you by balancing the the thousand different lasers off of it of course it's going to give you slider determines what objects are where in terms of distance but they do not tell you they do not distinguish colors very well they do not just nobody said anything about college i'm telling you if it's an octagon stop sign a lidar can absolutely tell but they don't read a stop sign they just can tell no no i'm not saying read i'm just saying in that case both both lidar but the camera read the stop sign right but then it didn't realize that it was way further away than it really was and it wasn't even an actual sign where if you added the light area said oh not only it's really far away that's actually part of a big uh billboard and not an octagon shaped and that's where lighter would have helped so that's just how lidar would have all helped now as far as the noise is concerned cameras are quite noisy as well they actually have more noise that you can argue than uh radars but they serve two different purposes right with your eyes i'll end with my eyes a lot of times we don't see things in the dark or sometimes reflections you know screw things up and lanes and a lot of things go wrong especially with older eyes right so uh lidars and radars do help with perception they do help with understanding what their objects are seeing through the darkness is a thing you know not giving a crap about the glare there are a lot of benefits and yes it has a lot of noise but so does the camera so those are kind of the counters to to these sort of notions how we can just you know vision only and we're good these technologies are what is the latency on lidar different letters have different latency and also don't forget it's not just about latency it's also about how fast you process the signal well that's that's kind of the whole point right so what's going on with tesla is by going straight to vision and by going from having a digital signal pro digital image processors processing the photons that come in and then translink that into image that the car then has to translate back to data they switch to raw photon counts right my guess and i don't know the answer to this question my guess is that the the lidar data would be late the processing of the lidar data would take too long and would slow down the car making its decisions i think you know the thing you're talking about with the stop sign that's over on a billboard right there's there's an infinite array of corner cases edge cases whatever you want to call it and the secret to that is not having some additional software some additional hardware to have a different way of looking at things the secret to that is getting the neural nets better training you know training the neural nets on more data and having more compute and that's what tesla's been doing more data more compute they got more cars driving fsd and they've got more uh gpus and and dojo coming online and they are rapidly improving what they have and i can only tell you i i don't have that problem i have never i've driven 60 some thousand miles on fsd beta and i don't have the problem that you're describing and i yeah but that's that's not a good argument because it's just saying that you know i have this one thing you know what my car is has no problems so no other car that was made has no problem you know what i'm saying no i'm just saying generally speaking because i get this all the time i would criticize a car or you know most of the time would be tesla and then somebody or a million people would say well my tesla is okay it doesn't have a gaps in panels it doesn't have this and this i was okay yours doesn't but if 10 do that's really bad in terms of quality so these are all anecdotal this is nothing that i can check or we can put into a bigger set of data of what's actually happening with a product right so who has the data tesla has the data by the way uh and they're not releasing it that's another thing that's kind of weird that they're not releasing their data do you think they're motivated to make it work of course they're motivated to make it work so so they have the data don't you think they're at a better place to decide it than me with my experience driving fsd beta or you with your experience not driving fsd beta in terms of whether or not to add a radars or lighters yes well so yes and no first of all elon is a very stubborn man so once he makes a call he doesn't ever want to admit that he is wrong so that's one thing that actually uh works against the actual progress at tesla i i feel it and secondly his job is not to make really fsd beta better though that would be great his job is to make as much money as possible for the investors and when you remove those parts you know radars and so forth you save money so i think he's got two jobs there and one overpowers the other so that's not always a good argument saying well doesn't he want to make it work he wants to make more money you're saying you're saying elon is is trying to make more profits when so many people in the the so-called tesla bull community the gary blacks and ross gerber are complaining that tesla's not profitable enough no no now you're talking about investors and i don't care about investors i'm only looking at this from a perspective of a consumer that's another weird phenomenon that goes goes on in tesla community and i understand most of you guys own stock but what's good for tesla as a company doesn't mean necessarily it's good for a consumer and i will always be on the side of the consumer never on the side of multi-billion dollar corporation whether it's tesla or rivian or volkswagen as a consumer i would say that anybody who buys any vehicle other than a tesla is making a mistake if you buy a tesla you're buying the most efficient car and you're buying the safest car and you're buying the most fun car and you're my my child i had a volkswagen passat and i was getting this model x and i could have sold my model 3 for twice as much as i sold the passat for but i wanted my child driving in a tesla not a volkswagen and this one we can agree to disagree i i don't think that tesla you're saying you're speaking for the consumer and i am a consumer and i own two teslas and i chose to have my child who i cherish very much in the safest car i could have her in yeah but there's a bunch of people who chose them for you know mustang lucky and thought their children are safer there i i don't know if you love your child more than they love their children i think that different people have different priorities and views on things and there is no such thing as the best car ever this is the best car ever for you but for someone else another car is the best they are the safest cars on the road period no question about an nhtsa the iihs crash data the euro end cap the australian all the crash testing and all the um the adas testing all the the this you know the vehicle avoid avoiding you know automatic emergency braking all that kind of stuff all that testing tesla's consistently outperform other vehicles they they're they're safer in crashes and they're better at avoiding crashes we just had an incident not that long ago where somebody in a tesla this guy was suicidal whatever and drove himself and his family off a cliff and i know this spot this is devil's slide i used to live in moss beach california he drove off this cliff and i drove past this cliff many times and every time once or once or twice a month somebody would drive off that cliff and they would always die and they said we went down figuring where we're gonna pull the bodies out and they were alive and they were barely injured i think you're missing my point i'm i'm arguing with you that tesla is the safest cars if if uh if that's what data shows that's fine but that doesn't make it the best car for someone else if your priority is safety for your child then that's your decision to make it the best car but if your priority is to maybe show off in front of your friends how fast it goes zero to 60 or whatever else people do or maybe a budget not everybody can afford these teslas you know then a different car is best that's all i'm saying right but um let's uh wait the zero to 60 thing what car do you want to match against my plaid model x the one that will beat it or so the plaid model s now there is a rivera there is you know foreign how much does that cost doesn't matter how much it costs you want to name a car that will beat your plan and that's that's the car i mean what do you mean i couldn't care less about 0 to 60. i i i i couldn't but okay listen let's let's get back to the more of a reality here because i i don't think zero to 60 matters to most consumers so you know moving forward because again one thing we agreed on is that we both want us to work because it will save tens of thousands of people every year if it actually works so you and i agree the faster the better and i think tesla is going to get there first however my concern is that you know uh repeatedly every year or two the head of the autopilot and ai whatever you want to call it uh quit and it's not really replaced by someone else it's you know it's a second in command that becomes you know and now we've gone through three of them leave uh kaparthy left was the last one right yeah okay so ashoka swami has been the head of the autopilot team for a long time i don't know who you're uh andrea karpathy was the guy in charge of full self-driving you know that's not true on tesla that's not true carpathy was one of the people on the team he was not in charge ashok alaswami was in charge of fsd of the autopilot team and he had he was in charge before and he's in charge now andre carpathy was a very valued contributor to the tesla team he was really important he delivered a lot of value and he did in fact leave people leave companies all the time that's not how tesla positioned them okay that's not how tesla positioned them at all it was very clear that poker party was in charge he was in every single you know uh and and the presentation that in the shareholder meeting that tesla had and he was headlining the uh the ai days right so um so he's gone no one replaced him really my concern is that who is actually is in charge who whose vision again no pun intended but sort of whose vision is being implemented because as you remember a couple of years ago tesla admitted that they've ran their uh algorithm and their software into the ground so much they had to completely rewrite the core software even roll back some of the features so what i'm saying is that if people who couldn't do it right in the first place you know uh uh are are still there and some of them are not who is this new generation of people who's running it because we know it's not elon he's right now with twitter as he probably should be um who is in charge of this because this is the most important part of developing this the software the last one or two percent right and i don't i don't see the visionary right now and that's my concern okay i've answered this question before ashok ella swami has been in charge and is still in charge of the autopilot team and he's presented at both ai days and he presented at investor day and he presented on this there was a separate presentation and it's very clear his goal is to make cars that won't crash and he presented this brilliant presentation on how they've stopped they've solved they've stopped 40 pedal miss applications a day that they figured out how to detect when somebody's hitting the wrong pedal they're hitting the accelerator pedal when they should be hitting the brake pedal and they've they've avoided 40 accidents a day by you know stopping pedalmist applications how long has he been at tesla i don't know i think it's several years yeah i mean from what i'm understanding he was a part of the original team that ran into the ground and now had to rewrite the code which is listen by the way i have no problems with people admitting their mistakes and saying hey we need to back up and rewrite it by the way full kudos to them i'm just saying i don't know i don't know i'm not saying they can't i don't know if the same team or the same vision can actually do it if they you know fail for the for the first time because it could be a good thing could be a bad thing uh i'm just going to tell you let's see ashok has been with tesla for nine years and five months so he was originally part of the problem director of autopilot software okay so let's let's talk let's let's do a comparison okay i just watched the falcon heavy i watched my fourth falcon heavy launch and they did not recover the boosters by the way i have seen several booster recoveries coming back to land i have seen several re-entry burns i live in cape canaveral i don't think i moved to cape canaveral so i could watch launches so before spacex successfully was recovering boosters they crashed a bunch of them and uh starship just blew up the launch was launched a success it was the launch of failure uh you know people who understand understand that that was a success they generated a lot of data they learned a lot so one of the challenges when you're doing what you're doing is you're going to get things wrong and elon talks about that you're always wrong your goal is to be less wrong and they reached a local maximum they realized they reached a local maximum they thought they were on the path to success and they realized they weren't on the right path and they stepped back and they redid it and they got rid of radar and they went division only and they went to uh raw photon counts and they're generating more data and they're generating more compute and they've got now dojo coming online soon and they're making all these steps that they can to get to where they need to be so uh the idea that they're not doing what needs to be done uh they're you know you're gonna make mistakes on the way honestly i have my my crazy idea that might oh sorry you can't see it my background uh on the zoom is these these little cars i have this project where i'm trying to make single passenger electric vehicle and i keep screwing up i had a project where i was trying to make a a quiet doghouse and i built the dog house and i put my iphone inside and played loud music and i put it outside and played a loud music and it was louder inside the doghouse if you don't try if you don't keep trying things you'll never get there so what tesla does and what spacex does is you keep getting it wrong until you figure out how to get it right yeah listen i i get it you miss all the shots you don't take i totally understand that what i'm saying is that if you are that not that sure if you can get there which obviously this team wasn't you shouldn't be telling people it is almost there and then charging them money for it you see to me just comes the full circle okay so that misses the point um they didn't tell us we were there elon was pretty confident i genuinely believe they thought they were going to get there they thought they were close they didn't realize they were heading for a local maximum they discovered there were things they didn't understand that the problem was harder than they thought it was but by having people have the software operating on their cars it generates more data and you need to generate more and i listen i paid the money i'm one of these people you're trying to protect from this i paid the money for fsd i'm happily contributing to tesla solving fsd i believe and i want to be clear about this i want to be clear about this too because this is really important i made a about this my younger child was in a dance program at a middle school and there's another girl my younger daughter's name is hannah and there's another girl at the school named hannah can't remember hannah's name off the top of my head so that that hannah was had moved away somewhere in north florida was skateboarding through a crosswalk and a guy in a car hitter he didn't see her and he hit her and she died right now i believe that if that car had been a tesla with fsd it would have stopped right and i believe that if we get to the point where we have cars that are self-driving and we you know you have to take risks and you have to make mistakes to get there but if you don't go full on full effort to get there then you're not gonna get there and the fact that elon musk and ashok ella swami and karpathy when he was there and the rest of the tesla team are pushing really hard to get there is what's going to get us to the point where we do save 40 000 lives here in america and a million lives a year in the world that's what's gonna we're in agreement there we're we're in a full agreement there i'm just saying he wouldn't but it wouldn't be happening you wouldn't have this if they weren't selling fsd to people because you wouldn't be generating the data no you're wrong there i'll tell you why first of all if then they should have given this for free first of all if they wanted to have human trials and uh what i chose to pay for it i chose to pay for it that's fine but listen i don't regret paying for it we're you're complaining on behalf of consumers who aren't complaining there's a couple of cranks out there who are saying hey it didn't do what i wanted it to do the reality is the vast majority of people who paid for fsd are happy that they have what they have no i don't know if that that date is correct because all i hear from from in my comment section people contacting me that they actually are not very happy with it but that's beyond the point i'm saying and by the way the way you do testing a lot of times in not is not by putting it out in 800 000 cars you actually have an amazing good virtual reality generators where you can actually reproduce all of that stuff they do a million times more they do that too they show that at an ai day they do that also but you can't generate real world data without being in the real world the real world pops things up that you just can't imagine just crazy stuff happens all the time and you can't simulate the real world completely because randomly totally agree that's why you that's why you go over the accident reports rather than do human trials and even if you want to do human trials by people who are fully you know uh um uh consenting to this well don't make money on that just wait you know uh uh so and or at least i speak for it i don't regret paying for it and i benefited from it because it's not human trials where people are put at greater risk it's a trial where people are made safer by doing the trial it makes us safer not more dangerous i am paying and i've happily paid for fsd and it makes me safer it makes my family safer it makes the people around me safer it makes the other cars safer your prediction when will tesla full self-driving uh be fully self-driving we're talking about i know i know i know you don't this system but nevertheless when will it be level five okay so i'm not going to use that terminology and i gave it to you before there's a point what can i can when can i nap on the back seat of a tesla driving and if something happens there's two steps step one is use staff to stay in the driver's seat but you don't have to pay attention anymore until the car says hey i need you to take over right i think that's coming by the end of the year maybe early next year and then six months to a year after that we get to full robo taxi so early to mid 2025 . we're gonna have i can't disagree more but i am rooting for you to be right and for me to be wrong because the faster we get there the more lives will will save and it could be yours or mine so um all right listen hopefully we're still around in another 12 months to see which one of us was right and uh we'll get some bragging rides at the end of this cool well we'll be in other countries but we'll still be around yes that's true that's true wow 40 minutes of talking to warren and i wasn't called an idiot once kind of disappointing actually but we have taped another debate right after that so don't forget to because i will release that in the next couple of weeks but if you would to know more about my opinions on tesla here's another one where i tell you why i think the tesla cyber truck is actually going to be a bad idea for tesla as a brand in the long run enjoy that see you guys next time and remember to stay charged,-1
E for Electric,PLXAbfWOvf5Ytlrxe40n0F7dGvWkqRpHM1,FlpIgEY-bwU,i did not take photos inside i am a tesla critic and i have a cyber truck reservation but who doesn't i mean let's be honest having a cyber truck reservation is being friends with an instagram model you talking about her showing off her pictures to your friends and you even lend her a hundred bucks that one time but you are never bringing her home ever i am also going to point something out that no one has ever said about tesla before and there have been a lot of things said about tesla including on this but before that let's start at the beginning the cyber truck unveiling i was there reporting live on the event and more importantly taking pictures for my tinder profile that was when tesla still had epr department which they have since dismantled and replaced with elon musk's twitter account at that time they still allowed independent media and not just tesla fanboys with youtube channels but those days much the cyber truck spec and price list are gone and i remember standing there with other journalists waiting for the big moment and when it finally arrived and we saw you know what was brought on stage we were that's funny elon's funny so um when's the real truck gonna be here and it took us a while but we finally did realize that we were being um cyberpunked now don't get me wrong i did make a reservation anyway i mean i'm not an idiot but the only cyber thing that has been delivered so far is this cyber backpack which i actually use every day it's very nice uh it's not made by tesla that's why it's in production but uh i put a link in the description of this just in case if you want to get one as well so why do i think the cyber truck will not only be a flop in the long run but will also very likely jeopardize tesla's empire that until now has been unstoppable i mean the damn thing does have over a million reservations so what in the world am i talking about we'll tell you something that i don't think too many people realize ready tesla is a one trick pony right now they are essentially selling just one car model what this is insane how could you wait wait let's really take a look at tesla's lineup first let's dismiss the fact that it's more than a car company at this point we used to think it would be more of an energy company but at this point its energy division has been a disappointment and has been passed by many other companies with only around four percent of market share tesla's 2022 solar roof installations are only two percent of its own last target let's also forget about the semi-truck as it is a commercial vehicle and will never sell in real numbers as it shouldn't and let's also dismiss the model s and model x which production tesla has not cared about for many years now and according to elon musk is only making them for well i'll let him break the news we're continuing to make them more for sentimental reasons than anything else so we're now left with the model y and the model 3 which essentially make the vast majority of tesla profits but alex see those are two models not one but are they i mean you know they are the same car right they are essentially a before and after pictures of an electric car atkins diet as a matter of fact the majority of parts used for both of these cars are exactly the same so if you really think about it and i know tesla fanboys with youtube channels don't really doing much of that tesla's entire empire relies on just one product and that is not good so the all-electric pickup truck is a huge opportunity for tesla to really expand into a segment that a legitimate automaker has to be a part of especially in america three of the best-selling vehicles in the us by far are pickup trucks the ford f-150 the chevy silverado and the ram 1500 tesla has to compete in that market but it won't with the cyber truck and i'll tell you why but before that a quick reminder that this is brought to you by electron look one of the biggest challenges with owning an ev is finding convenient and reliable ways of charging it and it's no secret that most ev drivers to charge at home that's why lectron built the powerful v-box in-home charging station it provides up to 48 amps of power for your j17 72 ev it adds up to 46 miles of range per hour and fully charges your ev in under 6 hours simply plug in your car at night and wake up to eat full charge in the morning get one today using the discount code in the description of this so the cyber truck first delivery date has been set it is most likely going to be at the end of september according to elon musk which means well we don't really know when it's already been delayed three times since it's unveiling in 2019 so what's one more let's talk about why this may be a flop that tesla can't really afford in the long run let's start with the fact that this is the very first time when tesla is not the first one to market with a breakthrough electric car model they are not even second third or fourth ford gm ravian lordstown and then gm again by then all have beat them to market the ford f-150 and the chevy silverado are by far the proven winners and trusted names for pickup owners it will be not only hard to sell them an electric version of any pickup truck but from a completely new brand they've never experienced is a million times harder secondly how many people will even consider this to be a pickup truck i mean there is the unconventional let's call it a design which was obviously drawn by a drunk five-year-old with a ruler but at the end of the day the cyber truck is a lot of cyber and not as much of an actual truck from the size of the bed to the features for a working small business owner or a construction worker with many other competitor features simply not available at all the bi-directional charging head-up display instrument panel or even an ability to easily adjust side mirrors or the air conditioning you can't make it all up with a sort app the which one the fart app you know oh no oh god no excuse me and i know what you're saying alex there are more than a million reservations it will be years until they all run out no just no we've already learned that lesson with the model 3 long reservation list after all of the delays price increases feature removals and additions very small percentage of those reservations have actually converted and we should expect even smaller one for the cyber truck because unlike the model 3 there is already a stiff competition from the new and established brands and let's remember that none of the reservation holders know what the features specs and price points even are so none of them really know if they even want or can afford the trucks they've reserved and of course we gotta talk about something that tesla fanboys love to brag about which is the very unique and one of the kind architecture of the cyber truck from the exoskeleton and the structural battery to the stainless steel body and to the bulletproof glass well unless a middle-aged man lightly throws small metal balls at it but as many benefits as these new technologies bring they may take away just as many make no mistake about it it will be expensive to fix have limited repair options long part replacement delays and a higher likelihood of totaling the truck even after relatively small collisions let's also remember that the only other company that has tried to mass produce a car with a stainless steel body the delorean went bankrupt after building less than 10 000 of them and of course there are many other disadvantages the truck being too big for many garages and parking spots here pictured with a random mildly popular 5'8 youtuber for scale also only having one color which is very hard to maintain as anybody with a stainless steel refrigerator knows and just in case if you haven't noticed i think that color choices are important of course the fact that elon musk himself has said multiple times that he doesn't really care if the truck flops imagine any other ceo saying that about their most anticipated product now with the above said obviously none of this will matter during the first year or two when the biggest tesla fans will be gladly buying every single cyber truck that tesla makes but at some point this may become tesla's biggest mistake now remember how we talked about the tesla model why you know the chubby model 3 well it is the best selling ev in the world right now but did you also know there are over 30 alternatives all electric on the market this year if you didn't i've listed all of them for you right here yeah stayed up all night uh and some of them might actually surprise you so check them out and as always remember to stay charged,3
E for Electric,PLXAbfWOvf5Ytlrxe40n0F7dGvWkqRpHM1,LMkTxSMBCEk,tesla's self-driving feature or as they call it the full self-driving even though i think they've spelled full wrong versus a tesla critic which by the very clever full joke which i'm sure you've enjoyed greatly you probably guessed it's me now let's talk about what you may not know about tesla's full self-driving mainly because elon musk doesn't really want you to and we're gonna start right now [music] welcome to e4 electric first things first you're probably wondering why is this guy who's supposed to be an electric car fan is hating on tesla well it's kind of the same way how you can love soccer but still be hating on this resident i says right see if you love soccer you would hate anything or anyone who would make people hate it mr caraco here now think of tesla's full self-driving package as embarrassing soccer flops we should acknowledge it's silly but still admire tesla and electric cars now let's be very clear tesla's self-driving technology is by far better than anything else that's on market right now and yes there is gm screws google's waymo and other makers that have driverless vehicles on the road right now including two simples semi trucks but those are very much limited to certain routes and even times of the day there are also driver assist features the blue crews from ford the super cruise from gm and the drive pilot from mercedes but those are very much limited to small number of roads and even speed though last time i tried the super cruise it did try to ram me into the freeway divider in other cars which i did not appreciate por favor gm tesla's self-driving technology is for all roads all speeds and all times of day however one thing that tesla's full self-driving technology is not it's not fully self-driving first tesla takes no responsibility for anything thing bad that that happens when it's self-driving software makes the life and death decisions for you so think of it as your united states congressman it also requires you to keep your eyes on the road and hands on the wheel at all times or as i call it and call me crazy um driving so as long as you are driving tesla will absolutely take credit for it along with the fifteen thousand dollars which is the current price of the fsd package secondly it makes tons of mistakes some are small and some are deadly i mean it does drive better than a drunk five-year-old and even better than some prius drivers but overall it is nowhere ready to get its own driver license as a matter of fact if you were in some of the select tv markets in the us this year you might have seen a super bowl ad showcasing how dangerous the tesla autopilot is i'll show it to you and tell you who paid for it in just a second but before that a quick reminder that this is brought to you by lectron look one of the biggest challenges with owning an ev is finding convenient and reliable ways of charging it that's why electron is pioneering great charging solutions this portable tesla charger you have a choice of either e32 or 12 amp charging max depending on your available outlet simply swap out the charging plugs accordingly and get up to 20 miles of range per hour with dual level charging capability and a 21 foot cable and this portable charger is perfect for powering your tesla no matter where you are yet one today using the discount code in the description of this so here's the ad that the billionaire and the former candidate for the governor of california dan of dowd ran during this year's super bowl tesla full self driving will run down a child in a small crosswalk swerve into oncoming traffic hit a baby in a stroller go straight past stop school buses ignore do not enter signs and even drive on the wrong side of the road tesla's full self-driving is endangering the public with deceptive marketing and woefully inept engineering ninety percent agree that this should be banned immediately why does nitsa allow tesla full self-driving as you can see it is a bit dramatic but it does get the point across his previous ad published last year was actually more effective if you ask me because he simply took the footage of tesla fans filming their full self-driving enabled cars and as you can see these do look the driver may have just been a drunk five-year-old now mr o'dowd claims that all he wants is to implement standards in which companies tesla conduct what i call human trials by releasing this type of software to see and what creative ways people can hurt themselves but that begs a big question and no one better to answer it then well mr o'dowd himself so and whose job is it to create this standard and enforce it well for it to be in a government standard it'd have to be uh nitza national highway transportation safety agency or the or the dmv in california department of motor vehicles well guess what is there a doubt nitz and yes that's how it's pronounced which sounds more a jewish holiday dish rather than the government organization this is delicious just gets into your teeth a little anyway so nitsa has finally stepped in and this year forced tesla to recall pretty much all cars they've ever made with the full self-driving package activated it's amazing that they've waited for this long when the problems with the full self-driving software were much worse two and three years ago but it finally did happen tesla has also lost multiple lawsuits over falsely advertising the full self-driving package which i cannot stress enough is not fully self-driving but what is preventing tesla from delivering on its promise i mean elon musk has continuously promised tesla drivers that their cars will achieve full self-driving capability it for years and lied every time now here's the compilation of some of them put together by mr o'dowd's youtube next year will probably be 90 capable of autopilot so 90 of your miles could be on auto we're probably only a month away from having uh autonomous driving at least for highways and for relatively simple roads the model s and model x at this point can drive autonomously with greater safety than a person right now foreign we're still on track for being able to go across country from la to new york by the end of the year fully autonomous but next year for sure we'll have over a million robo taxis on the road i'm extremely confident of achieving full autonomy and releasing it to the tesla customer base next year when do you think tesla will solve level four fsd i mean it's looking quite likely that it will be next year the tesla community continued you to believe him and some of them even fork over the money to have this feature elon has insisted that self-driving cars don't really need lidars a technology that almost all automakers use for their self-driving tech and tesla has recently removed even the radars from use relying on cameras only while claiming that if people drive using their vision only so should the cars which doesn't really make sense if you think about it because the goal is not to have cars drive as good as people but to do it much much better and for that you need much much better tools radars and lidars now it does appear that tesla will be going back to the new generation of radars in the near future in addition to that over the last several years tesla has lost the head of its self-driving development project not once not twice but now three times and has failed to replace all of them and we all know that elon himself is not heading that project right now because he is busy proving to all of us that twitter can actually be worse than it already was i even made an ad for him you know to air during the super bowl do you enjoy twitter a social media platform where complicated issues are talked about with the 280 character limit ruled by unchecked agenda of celebrities and billionaires then check out the new twitter now owned by one of them with upcoming um let's call them improvements we'll get rid of all accounts that are obviously fake bots and nobody hates bots more than our new owner we'll welcome new users who have never used twitter before big league happy tweeting gentlemen and modeled after our new owner's other company introducing the twitter autopilot where you don't have to pay any attention to facts or evidence not that you did before you're biased and uninformed claims will be created it and tweet it out for you while you sleep and just for twenty dollars a month what that's too much oh okay then um for just eight dollars a month we'll verify that you know you have eight dollars and place this mildly attractive check box next to your handle so everyone knows that you're too a part of the entitled social media elite download the new twitter app and cancel someone you disagree with today i don't know why he did not use it and all of this is already on top of the fact that a couple of years ago tesla has admitted that they had to rewrite the main part of itself driving software which means they have ran it into the ditch and it appears that the new software was written by pretty much the same team then ran it into the ditch in the first place it's kind of asking a burglar to help you shop for a new tv that he stole from you last week meanwhile elon musk and his army of tesla fans have flooded youtube and other social media platforms with praises for tesla's self-driving tech and anyone who has ever criticized it has been gone after by the musketeers as i call them or elon himself in one way or another including me and this is what that looks why would you do this why would you watch this guy he has no value whatsoever if you have watched his before don't watch it again if you are currently a subscriber to e for electric unsubscribe this guy adds nothing zero value he is a negative on society he has a negative on the ev community he is a stain now i know what you're saying alex this guy is pretty much wearing the t-shirt that pretty much is giving away the fact that he invests and makes money off of the tesla stock that's hypocritical no let's be fair he doesn't just make money off of tesla stock he also makes money off of selling those very t-shirts so yeah now if you want to hear more from the musketeers all you have to do is look in the comment section of this very and as a matter of fact i will pin the comment of whoever wants me to die the most to the top for your viewing pleasure but listen with the above set it is still very likely that it will be tesla that will be the first one to achieve the full self-driving capability or come a close second but it is important to acknowledge that they are nowhere near that stage just yet though if they would spend as much effort on developing it as they spend on fighting the regulators trying to spread the misinformation about it or cancel its critics myself i think they would get there much faster alright looking forward to all of your comments including from you the musketeers other than that see you guys next time and remember to stay charged [music],3
E for Electric,PLXAbfWOvf5Ytlrxe40n0F7dGvWkqRpHM1,tdqjxKy5VYA,somebody has to do this and since nobody else wants to i guess it will be me again i will break down this week's tesla semi-truck event with my reactions but this will be very different from what you've probably already seen in the media i will point out things that other youtubers and journalists seem to conveniently miss i'll tell you what they've missed why they've missed it and we're gonna start right now [music] welcome to e4 electric real quick if this is the first time you're watching one of my videos well this is kind of a counterbalance to all of the reporting you have seen on this event mainly by tesla fanboy channels here on youtube and the mainstream publications don't usually to challenge that narrative not to lose the clicks from the tesla crowd so even though on this i usually try to present both sides of the story something i've been trying out for about six years now i feel the first side of any tesla story is usually covered pretty well as a matter of fact if you believe everything you've heard from them you'd think that the tesla semi trucks were delivered by jesus christ himself i have seen so much a misleading and untrue information already put out there by the tesla fan channels that in addition to reporting the information they've decided to hide i also have to challenge the information they didn't by the way for today's humble brag if you will can i just point out that it looks for the last five years i have been the only influencer who has ever been behind the wheel of this little monster now i am not saying that i am that good i'm just saying that the security at that event uh you know wasn't so let's go over the key moments of the event and what was said and then i'll point out what wasn't said which may just be as important okay so first i want to point out that it was very cool that the stage was essentially a flatbed of each trailer very nice touch okay here we go let's dive in yeah i can't believe it's been five years so we unveiled the tesla semi uh five years ago um it's been a lot that's happened since then say the least good point it has been over five years after the unveiling and elon is right a lot has happened since then one of them is that at least three other manufacturers have already brought their own electric semi trucks to market deliveries of the volvo vnr electric semi with a 275 mile range started back in 2021 which i actually got to drive that was pretty cool daimler's freightliner e cascadia with e 220 mile range which i got to ride in as well and even nikola trey with e330 mile range deliveries for both started this year now obviously these range numbers are about half of tesla's but per tesla's own slides showcased during the original unveiling and here it is 80 of routes are under 250 miles and one can argue that it makes more sense to build fast chargers at each destination rather than pay for twice as much battery capacity to make a round trip on one charge and yeah we're looking forward to actually delivering our first production trucks to pepsico so this is going to be fantastic yeah and also a huge thank you to all of our other customers wait wait wait wait hold this i mean somehow someone started talking behind the camera and all of a sudden we see this guy next to elon no introduction no graphics this was very odd now come to find out the guy is dan priestly the senior manager of tesla semi engineering and i had to search for his name and the title for a while because many articles don't even mention him he wasn't even there uh it's actually 20 of us vehicle emissions because you've got a huge vehicle and it's being driven uh all the time so when you factor in the number of hours driven and the weight that it's carrying it's actually although it's only one percent of vehicle production it's 20 of vehicle emissions and it's over a third of all the particulate emissions so from a sort of health standpoint particularly in cities this is a huge impact it's gigantic so um that's why we're doing it you know so [music] no that's not why you're doing it i mean don't get me wrong improving the air quality especially in larger cities where people die from lung diseases all the time is a big deal but to be honest and let's be honest elon does not care about people's health he barely cares about his if he did he wouldn't have made his employees go back to work at the factory during the worst periods of the pandemic now i am okay with elon being a greedy billionaire that he is because he's done a lot of good but it would be nice if he was just a little more honest about it as soon as they get asked well you know tesla just produced uh you know fast cars or or premium cars or whatever it's but but what's our actual mission our actual mission is to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy so um that's why we're making this wide range of cars that don't really make sense from a brand standpoint i guess traditionally but they make total sense when you consider what's the mission of the company missions company is to accelerate sustainable energy now not buying that one either because if it was true if really that was the goal of tesla then elon wouldn't be attacking every other company that's trying to contribute to that very cause yeah i mean it looks sick i mean you want to drive that i mean that thing looks it came from the future it i mean it drives a it's driving a you know a tesla literally [applause] um it's fun it looks awesome okay so this is where elon and tesla deserve all the credit over and over again because this is about defining the future now i don't really think that's too many trucking companies care if their trucks look sick but the reason the tesla semi does is because it is very aerodynamic which means you waste less energy when driving it this is something that the truck manufacturers should have been doing a long time ago regardless of what they are powered by same goes for nikola volvo and daimler's electric trucks because they can certainly use some of that aerodynamic design that should make them go much further i mean actually especially if you if you don't have if you're not towing anything you could zip around it did looks crazy basically it looks a elephant moving a cheetah it doesn't look right correctly i do that visual elon i bet that that was a good one but the other reason that it's a beast is because it's also efficient and you can go 500 miles on a single charge on one of these things so it's the mix of those two that this is why this is a game changer and what's awesome is both of those are enabled by our new thousand volt powertrain which is the first vehicle that we're doing with that and don't worry there'll be some more things more vehicles coming with that okay so this is a big one the 500 mile range with an 82 000 pound load has been delivered as promised and as always tesla is once again setting up a new standard for the rest of the competition the 1000 volt powertrain is another one but what's even more exciting is that it seems that tesla will be moving to that with their other vehicles which most likely going to include the cyber truck this is very important as the fastest charging evs out there already use something very close to it ranging from 8 to 900 volts in evs the porsche icon audi e-tron gt lucid air hyundai ioniq 5 and the kia ev6 tesla has been using 400 volt system all this time so it's good to see them taking the lead again so we're using our existing drive units power electronics infotainment that are super efficient heat pump hvac system and state-of-the-art inverters so we're able to leverage the existing powertrain and elements that are already made at volume in order to achieve extreme efficiency of cost and capability yeah and it also means we get to leverage all the reliability that the active car fleet is doing all right now we're back into the bs territory i mean first did he just say reliability i cannot think of the least reliable fleet of evs in the last 10 years than teslas i mean reliability is just not their thing it's amazing that they would bluntly say it off the stage this and everybody just eats it up also it is great that a lot of the parts have already been on the market in tesla vehicles but it is yet to be seen if those same parts used in passenger cars can be used in monsters the semi trucks so could be a good thing and could also be a bad thing and both have happened to tesla in the past only time will tell so to be clear these semi trucks are running 24 7 between our sparks technically in sparks not reno but most people think of it as reno reno spocks uh and tahoe and uh yeah this is technically the uh called the tahoe reno industrial complex or trek um this is an interesting backstory about why it's called that fairy yeah i'd be just gonna giggle that youtube you know actually just keep going we've got a try motor uh powertrain system so and they're we're using the cob no wrap sleeve so essentially we're using the the plaid model s model x powertrain uh and um but it would work and actually enabling the two of the drive units to actually disconnect so that they're not free spinning so the efficiency is actually much greater in cruise yeah this is really unique i mean we're going with the tri-motor system yeah no again this is not unique there are other evs on the road right now that have been using the same technology of the electric motor disconnect including the kia ev6 so you know there's some people out there say it can't be done um i don't know who might say that but i've heard rumors and uh so we just did it um yeah [applause] okay so this is this is what a lot of fanboys jumped on including even a relatively respected publication electric this is where elon refers to bill gates suggesting he said it could not be done but that's not true what bill gates actually said was that electric vehicles will probably never be practical solution for things 18 wheelers that's not the same at all and also for some reason and i wonder why sandy monroe nobody mentions this but sandy monroe one of the most popular tesla fans nowadays has said pretty much the same thing right here on the show more than once okay so here's the thing i um i believe first off that hydrogen is probably not the fuel that i would pick for a car but if i want to have a semi if i want to have a if i want to have a veto or i want to have an airplane i think that hydrogen is a perfect application he thinks that he's going to make a truck i think by the time you put all the batteries you're going to need for that truck it's going to be too damned heavy and you won't have any room for payload but no one in the tesla community is going to mention that and why bother when this supreme leader was very clear pointing out the very person to go after which they did the other billionaire and not elon's body i've seen to charge a truck this quickly you need a high power charger so we developed a megawatt class charger as the escape of charging at megawatt dc yeah and it's our next generation immersive cooling so it's liquid cooled so you don't need a gigantic elephant trunk of a cable you can actually have a small small cable and that cable it delivers a megawatt okay so this is another big one one megawatt charging now the top speed at the electrify america fastnet ionity another fast charging networks right now is 350 kilowatts of course we don't know how fast tesla can implement this and when the compatible tesla vehicles will even be on the market but it is yet another highest standard set for the industry you know for those that have worked and charge their cars on a v3 supercharger and the cable is nice and you know maneuverable it's the same thing here but now we're just shoving a megawatt through it instead so you know this is key for high power applications semi but you want to tell them or do you want me to tell them yeah i mean it's going to be used for cyber truck too yeah so this is this is coming to our superchargers uh next year oh how cute you want to tell them okay i'll tell them now i know i just told you that we don't know when the one megawatt chargers are going to be on the market and even though elon just told us you know next year that does not change my statement at all we still don't know simply because elon is probably the last person i would trust with timelines and i don't even need to go that far to give you one of the million examples production begins 2019 so if you order now get the part the truck in two years [applause] thinking of the original unveiling five years ago if you have noticed there were a lot of specs that were flaunted during that unveiling but very much omitted from this one from the 0 to 60 speed and a special sturdy windshield to things the price and the autopilot implementation which essentially is a signal to the trucking companies that they won't need to the truck drivers at all in a relatively near future nice move accidentally forgetting that one elon so now that you know everything that happened during that event i hope that if you made it this far into the you are still just as excited as i am about this because at the end of the day it is incredible that the semi trucks the freaking huge gas guzzling semi trucks are starting to shift to electric technology and that is a win for all of us i hope you all agree i am looking forward to all of your comments other than that see you guys next time and remember to stay charged [music],3
E for Electric,PLXAbfWOvf5YtNes11pbNdgq3N5dbZg0Qy,By1G_b7oRAc,electric cars are better than gas cars in every single way except for one which is charging charging at home and charging on the road has been a challenge for a lot of us the current ev drivers and has prevented a lot of you from buying your very first electric cars well it's i think it's going to change going in 2023 well i have just the right guest as a matter of fact i dare you i dare you to find a better electric car charging expert than the host of the state of charge youtube tom maloney who will be here in just a second and we will also as always take questions from you my live audience and we're gonna start right now foreign welcome to e4 electric where i reveal the truth behind the electric car headlines uh if you either either electric cars or the truth uh go ahead and on that button and the bell notification icon so you don't miss anything moving forward all right first of all uh if you're watching me live go ahead and let me know where you're watching me from and what electric car you're driving right now or maybe dreaming of uh buying very soon i appreciate that but meanwhile let's talk about it first of all you know electric cars are better than gas cars do i need to explain that they are faster the performance is better and they are more violably friendly they're quieter the tech is better the self-driving technology is is going into the electric cars not the gas cars they are safer because there is no engine there's a better crumble zone it's got apps we only have an hour so i'm gonna stop right now but there's one there's one thing that the electric cars unfortunately are lagging way behind uh gas cars and that is charging now gassing electric car is easy well not not cheap nowadays it's seven dollars a gallon i passed the gas station the other day it's insane uh but it is definitely easy and of course you get an added bonus of uh getting a high from the gas fuse which i'm not gonna lie i have missed that just a little bit but listen it takes three four five minutes to guess your car takes i mean obviously hours at home but with the fast charging networks uh still takes about 30 45 minutes sometimes uh to charge a regular normal electric car when you're going long distance and unfortunately that's still an issue and let's talk about long distance first because when i got my very first tesla back in 2012 right and i showed it to my friends and i was oh guys look at this it's all electric it's got a good range it's got this big monitor and the app that comes along with it look at this marvel of technology that is 2012 tesla model s and the first and only question they would ask me is yeah but uh can you drive it to la and i'm when do you need to drive to la once a year house is the first and only question but unfortunately that still is one of the biggest questions when people ask when they're shopping for an electric car now the problem the needle has been moved right because most of the electric cars you're buying now or on the road they have more than 200 miles of range and more and more now have over 300 miles of range so you don't have to charge as often for example i live here in auckland then i go to santa cruz once uh once a week and you know that's that's a long drive but i make it all the way there and still still buy a few friends houses and make it back on the same charge so and my car doesn't have the best range out there as a matter of fact it has half of the best range out there um and uh of course they're a fast charging networks the biggest one the biggest public one here electrify america as a matter of fact i'm just about to use them a lot because uh i will be traveling i'm leaving california and then at the end of this month and i'll be traveling through the united states and if you guys still want me to make a about why i'm leaving california which is not very political um uh let me know i will make a it will have nothing to do with electric cars though so let me know i'll be happy to explain um there's also evgo that's been expanding especially now that they have a partnership with the general motors and of course tesla superchargers the largest uh infrastructure essentially for fast charging here in europe and in china but it looks here in america they will be open to all of us very soon because tesla wants that sweet money from that infrastructure bill and that infrastructure bill will fund a lot of you know infrastructure uh and and think even now you can pretty much travel anywhere in in america which i might uh in the next several months um so any additions will only enhance what we already have which is not bad however the biggest challenge that i've seen and this is not very common yet but i think it will be very soon unless it it grows and i've seen it in last time i visited tesla supercharger there was a line right you have to wait in order to wait to get your charge um and this was in vacaville california not exactly a very popular charging location and it was a sunday afternoon but uh and i've seen those you know throughout the years and it's a problem but i the other day i've seen one under lecture by america here in oakland california that's another problem that definitely needs to be solved and of course it's solvable by building more of these however the other problem that's contributing to this one is the fact that people who are supposed to charge at home 99 of people should be charging at home overnight every day are not uh and that's why they coming over to tesla superchargers electrify america and taking up the spots because they need to charge to go you know to work the next day uh and taking it away from people who are traveling so that's that's a problem but when it comes to charging 99 of you and i know some of you will say oh but i go to tahoe every weekend grant it but for most of the people very much most of the time they should charge at home because uh it is not only convenient it's not only much cheaper but it takes seven seconds and i know you're saying alex what do you mean it takes hours and hours and hours what do you care what's happening when you're asleep the total amount of time that you need to put into getting your car fully charged overnight is about seven seconds three seconds to plug it in four seconds to take it out and hang it back on the wall then you're done you're ready to go so it is the most convenient however that's not what's happening now if you own a house or if you're renting a house you know uh most people myself when i lived in my house i would put up a charging station or at least uh run a 240 outlet and even if you're renting and there is a there is a electric dryer outlet you can use something you know newer charge they're one of the sponsors um you can get it plug it in as you can see on both sides you can charge either two cars or have your laundry done and charge your car uh no problem but where the challenge starts and i don't know tom has a very different opinion on this and of course uh he will make sure to let you guys know once he is on um uh when you're renting an apartment that's a big problem i've had this problem throughout ever since i bought my very first uh electric car in 2012 and even this year when i was moving to from sacramento to oakland it was once again a challenge it was very few apartment complexes have dedicated charging spots that's what you need a dedicated charging spot you can't just rely on one or two that just they have for common use because you don't want to gamble on whether or not you'll be able to pick up your kids from school the next day right you need a dedicated charger now the weird thing is then i finally found one and we had 20 spots i i i thought oh my god there will be 20 electric cars charging no uh half of the spots are taken by gas cars and the other half that's taken by electric cars are not even charging i think i'm one of two three people who are charging their electric cars next to electric car charger in addition to that we have tons of people there's rivians and teslas and balls that are just parked in regular spots and they never charge and granted some of them probably charge at work but a lot of them go out there and spend an hour two hours a week uh charging somewhere else and that is not a good experience for an electric car owner and something that i think most regular common people and families are not willing to do to take another two or three hours away from their families and go in charge um and obviously it's just inconvenient for for those of us who don't have the ability now as i'm getting on the road i will be one of those people i'll definitely report back to you guys whether i it or not but i'm pretty sure i know uh the answer now at the same times we have not had too many laws around the country past requiring apartment complexes to put up with the electric car chargers which is a shame i think at most some counties pass laws where okay if you're building a new building next year up to 20 of the parking spots need to be um a dedicated electric chargers but that's not going to do in another few years and what are we doing about the election the the the spots that all of the apartment complexes that are already up there is not much of a solution here and we need one now i promised you i told you that i will tell you about my favorite way uh to uh refuel your battery which is just as fast uh as as guessing a car which is a battery swap it's not very popular it's not very popular with you it's not very popular in the industry and it's definitely not very popular with tom because we'll let you know why in a second but neo as you're watching uh them right now has kind of pioneered and built out a pretty decent uh battery swap network in china and now launched it in europe we'll see how that goes over there and then there's a company called ample here in san francisco they've done it actually in a better way where they don't swap out the whole battery they just swap out one of the six modules which i think is the way to go for sure and of course cattle catl one of the biggest battery supply companies has launched their own series of batteries that are swappable and there's actually one model of electric cars in china that's already using that so we'll see if that takes off but that would be my choice because it is just very quick uh the bottom line is this when you're trying to implement a new technology into the masses that technology needs to be better and hopefully cheaper but definitely better than what people have right now and we're almost there but charging is definitely holding the entire thing back so now i think it's a good time to bring in my friend and a host of the state of charge youtube and really the best expert i know in this industry uh tom maloney tom how are you doing my friend hey alex how's it going it's going pretty good well you know let's start off by uh talking about uh long distance charging do you think we're finally at the point where long distance charging you know long distance traveling in electric car as long as it was purchased in the last few years or so uh is good enough to say okay we got it you can long distance travel in america in europe uh just fine so you know i think the point where we're at right now it's better than it's ever been it continues to get better i think for most road trips at least not all but for most road trips what we have today is adequate yeah and i think so i'm looking forward to it with mine now let's talk about home charging right obviously homeowners you and i were good uh and uh the problem of course is that most people rent and a lot of people live in in apartment complexes now i remember me and you had a lot of disagreements over this i think when um uh my ex-girlfriend asked me you know whether or not she should buy an electric car and i knew she was going to limit an apartment complex i said you know i hate to tell you this but you can probably just stick with a guest for now because you will have to go and consistently charge at a fast charging network um do you believe this is still a problem we need to solve yeah well we we still have inadequate infrastructure particularly for those that live in apartments and multi-family dwellings that can't charge at home alex it's it's a problem it's not a problem that's insurmountable but where we are today it's still very inconvenient if you can't charge at home so when used to change well i mean we you know there's no laws that i've seen that are being passed on on a larger scale and really that really gonna make a dent in this how do we make the apartment complex managers and and owners to add to these you know relatively expensive spots but i still feel it's something that you have to do sooner or later and with the infrastructure bill it should be a little bit easier on them financially how do we make it happen i i think it's pretty easy you stop renting from them if they don't provide it which is what's going to happen the market's going to work this out alex as more and more people get evs they're gonna you know tell their their building manager or the owner look we're moving out because we have an av and you don't provide uh charging here and then when somebody is uh calling them to rent their apartment they're going to ask them all about the apartment and say oh by the way i could charge my car there right no i can't oh okay forget it i'm gonna look somewhere else and then the the property managers are going to install charging they're going to have to or they're going to have empty units wow you are a real capitalist the market will work itself out david here has an interesting idea and i kind of agree with it let's see if you do uh he says so we need some ability to book some chargers with a monetary penalty for not using the book charge time and suspended access for repeated no shows what do you think about that yeah i i think it's a good idea i know chargepoint has uh in their app reserve charging uh in not all the locations they have the ability to do it but the site owner then is the one that ultimately decides if they want to initiate that or not i think that's a possibility coming up i think that would be good for the networks because they could also see exactly what the utilization is and how many people get denied because they the the that station is booked and then that might help them add more stations at the sites that need more plugs so yeah i think i think we're going to get to that point where you'd you'll be able to book you know you're you're in the middle of a road trip and you book a station that's a hundred miles away you book it for two hours from now and you roll in right in the right time and uh and plug in and and that plugs reserved for you only what do you think about uh if you're charging within uh i don't know five miles of your um address right obviously a local should your rate be higher because you're essentially misusing the charging station no because what if you live in an apartment and you need that charging station you know i mean i understand what you're saying there and you know in some use cases yeah if the person could charge somewhere else but um we can't penalize people that live in apartments and make them pay more that that wouldn't be fair all right here's another interesting one about uh you know battery swap repeat says battery swap stations appear to be one car at a time one if there are two three four cars in line i might as well charge well nope that's not how math works because the battery swap you know takes about two or three minutes nowadays and it will improve even faster depending on how many sort of you know modules you want to replace so you know i the last time i was a tesla supercharger the line was about 20 minutes 25 minutes and when i got stuck in in line that was another uh the guy behind me waited for probably almost 30 minutes though if you have two three even four cars in line that's still going to be under 10 minutes of waiting uh versus what i've just described so that goes much faster and of course yes right now there's one at a time but the more cars they make the more demand there is then there will be two cars at a time you can assume that one technology is improving but the competing one is not and just standing still tom does that make sense yeah i've i've i when i talked to neo about that um they had said i mean their stations are kind of they can drop them in place they just need the interconnection from the utility they said it was very easy for them to add another bay at the same location if the the um demand warranted it but you still can have a situation alex uh where pete mentioned where just the superchargers uh you know on uh usually there's never a backup but on a holiday a lot of people are traveling so now there's you know 10 cars in the queue waiting to get their three minute swap so um you know you're both kind of right there it definitely can happen uh but the but the the the operators can also add additional bays if sites are contin continuously uh you know backed up and they're mobile too here's an interesting follow-up question from l y 3t well battery swap cover you when your battery cannot hold a charge after years of use now correct me if i'm wrong tom uh that's a kind of another perk of a battery swap is because the batteries are maintained by the company in this case neo or ample so they will always have a a good battery if the battery you know seeing some degradation or just getting old that just goes right out of the circulation yeah that's you're correct alex um so there's no a problem with that the comment said you don't there's no your battery holding a charge if if you when you get in when you swap out and get a new battery now that's your battery and uh uh what happens is the manufacturers in addition to charging the batteries they'll be tested at these battery swap stations and if the battery falls below a certain capacity they'll just get taken out of circulation so there'll be no such thing as having a battery that you know can't hold the charge if you're using battery swap yeah and to me it's one of the perks all right let's go to another one uh from adam he he asks uh thoughts on airbnb of chargers companies evie watch or c charging in uk now we have one here called ev match as a matter of fact i had their ceo on a while back where essentially yeah if you have a charger that's external or you can run a cable people come in and charge to me i i'm not really sure how that would work in terms of you know if you're traveling long distance that's really the only time when you would need it and you know level to charging and that's the maximum that people can offer their houses and even businesses is just not fast enough unless it's an emergency do you agree with that tom is there is there any type of an airbnb uh you know way of of of of of you know sort of contributing to the infrastructure yeah the there is actually you know you can limit the time when people when your charger is available you know and it will lock itself out during the times you say it's not available so let's say for instance you work all day at an office so you're not home from six in the morning till six at night you know with your commute or whatever you could make your home charger available during those 12 hours and now somebody who lives down the block that lives in an apartment they roll up to your house at at six o'clock in the morning when you leave and they plug in and they leave their car there all day and they go walk home because they live a block away and they live in an apartment and now they're essentially using your uh charger while you know they're at home working and while you're at work so there is a business case for this and it can work yeah interesting i haven't thought about that uh martin says evs with swappable battery should be cheaper to buy than it is including a fixed battery well not only that but even leasing a battery uh should be cheaper than paying that extra money for the fixed battery because as i mentioned you shouldn't swap the entire battery you know if you're just going to the grocery store into work you really need a very small part of your battery so you're dragging all of this charge to battery cells that you're not going to use most of the time which actually decreases the range that the the module that actually will be used the module of battery cells that will be used uh because it has to drag another bunch of whatever 60 kilowatt uh 60 kilowatt hour battery with it so that should be cheaper um you know tom do you see any issues with the math here no you're correct the the lease of the vehicle would be less but then you've got to pay whatever it is to lease the batteries or to or to join the battery swap uh system so you know it's i don't think long term i think if you were to net it out over five years you're not going to save any money because you still need use of a battery uh you know i don't i don't think the financial saving would be worth it in my opinion um all right tom well listen once again thanks for joining me uh this is now your new home uh e4 electric i know you've been uh in my sunday videos for many years but now i feel this is much a more fun format for me and the viewers to actually uh have a good time uh thanks once again uh for doing this and i will see you next wednesday at 1pm pacific and i will no longer be here feel free to guess where i'm gonna be and i will tell you next wednesday all right well thanks for having me and take care everybody i'll talk to you next week all right tom um yeah guys as i said uh i will no longer going to be in california next wednesday no i'm sorry i lied next wednesday is my last wednesday here in california i'm leaving at the end of the month as a matter of fact i'm i'm heading out on a halloween night um and i said let me know if you want to know what and what and why and so forth uh why this is happening so uh all right guys i am looking forward to all of your comments because we always repost this as a shorter the next day other than that see you guys next time and remember to stay charged [music],1
E for Electric,PLXAbfWOvf5YtNes11pbNdgq3N5dbZg0Qy,2I300RpQl3c,i am going to help you pick out the right charger for your home and for your electric car whatever it might be so we're going to start right now [music] don't forget to to this if you are interested in everything that's going on in the world of electric cars today now i hate to tell you this but there is no such thing as the best electric car charger just there is no such thing as the best electric car or the best sushi restaurant it's different for everybody so instead of doing a top five common denominator bass chargers for an average consumer list we're gonna talk about best chargers in different categories the best home chargers on the budget the best smart home chargers the best tesla chargers and a few other categories that i'm sure you will be able to relate to but i'm not doing it alone i got the best guy in the business to help us out you know him as our weekly contributor he's also contributes to forbes and inside ev's but most importantly he is the host of his own youtube dedicated to home and fast charging of course i'm talking about tom malogne all right tom i would not dare make this without you because by far you're the best expert in the industry if if anything your backdrop definitely showcases that so let's jump right in uh and you know before we get to the categories uh let's talk about a couple of things that people ask all the time one you know people call these chargers by the way and i know you corrected me and you said these are charging stations what is the difference so yeah i i know everybody calls them chargers but the technical term is actually evse electric vehicle supply equipment that's because the charger is built into every electric car every electric car has what's called an on-board charger that's the device that actually charges the car these evsc or charging stations just supply energy to the vehicle safely they're really just glorified safety devices alex all right and it brings me to another question which is you know we decided not to have a category of the fastest charge because everybody wants to charge their cars as fast as possible why can't we talk about what which which charger is the fastest so you asked me about that let's do the fastest charging station and the reason why i kind of said i don't think that's a good way to go was because the car always dictates how fast it charges on ac level 2 charging so you know there is plenty of charging stations that can deliver up to 48 amps which is really the maximum that any ev can accept today so it's not really fair to to to pick one of those because there's a bunch of them available on the market that can deliver up to 48 amps all right and that brings me another question that i asked pretty often i'm sure you as well is well why can't i mean my car can charge at the supercharger or electrify america very very fast so why can't i do it at home because there's two different types of charging there's ac which is alternating current dc direct current charging at home level one charging is a regular household outlet that's 120 volts level 2 charging is 240 volts which is behind me now energy is stored in a battery as a direct current dc so when you charge a car from ac either level 1 or level 2 it has to be converted to dc that's basically what the onboard charger does so imagine the electricity coming from these units has to go through the onboard charger it converts it to dc direct current and stores it in the battery so that's why the on-board charger is the bottleneck it restricts how fast the car can charge when you charge dc fast charging or supercharging you you take energy directly from that charging station and it goes right into the battery it doesn't have to go through the on-board charger so it's not restricted so that way the battery can accept a lot more energy and charge a lot faster all right so now i feel we're ready to jump into the categories and the first category is the best smart home charging station yeah so you know i'd to point out first that these are my opinions there's there's a few really good ones on the market so i'm going to tell you which one's my favorite and then mention a couple other ones that are really close that i think are great deals also my my favorite smart charger is the nlx juice box uh it has more smart charging features than than any other smart charger we talk about smart chargers our chargers that are wi-fi enabled they come with an app you can uh view your pass charging sessions sometimes you can adjust the current you could schedule it to charge from your app you can see you know how long the car has been charging how much energy it took in many of them you can even uh pair with amazon alexa or google home and say hey uh you know alexa charge my car and the car starts charging uh you could say hey uh you know alexa how long has my car been charging and it'll tell you so it has a lot of smart charging features but the juicebox also allows you to pair your charger with your local utility and through a service called juicenet green charge your car when the most uh cleanest energy is available during the day so that's important for a lot of ev drivers they want to be clean they want their car to be zero emissions the juice juicebox is one of the only chargers that allows you to actually select when you charge your car based on how clean the grid is honorable mentions go to the wallbox pulsar plus and also the chargepoint home flexed they're also two very good smart chargers all right now before we go to the next category of course a quick reminder that this is brought to you very uh appropriate sponsors for this the first one is flow the home x5 is a great and durable home charger that allows you to schedule monitor and optimize your charging via a mobile app with 24 7 customer support get one using our exclusive 150 discount in the description of this and by new charge guess what the 220 outlet that powers your dryer can now be split also to power your electric car with the help of the new charger smart splitter which will automatically switch back to your dryer while you're doing your laundry get 50 off using the discount code in the description of this all right let's move on to the next category which is the best value okay that one should be pretty quick the grizzly here 40 amp grizzle e classic i think it's the best value for a charger it's a dumb charger it's not a smart charger so it doesn't pair with a what with wi-fi you can't select an app um that version is coming out but for now the classic is just the way it is it's a 40 amp charger it's built really tough uh it has adjustable power so you could set it to deliver the power that you want based on what your circuit can supply and uh up until very recently it only cost 399 now it recently jumped up to 459. i don't know if that's a permanent price increase uh i think it could be temporary because of the shortage with uh you know semiconductor chips and so forth but even at 459 it's a great value and that's my best value choice and now we come to the category that obviously dictates itself within the entire electric car community we're going to talk about specific chargers for tesla drivers it is its own category yeah and you have to do this alex because there are so many tesla sold i mean tesla's account for i i forget what the exact percentage is something 75 percent of all evs in in the us uh so you know we we had to give them their own category and the re another reason why is because they have their own connector tesla uses a different connector than all of the other uh electric vehicles in north america they use their tesla proprietary connector every other electric vehicle uses this the j1772 so for tesla owners i think it's particularly important that they get in my opinion the best choice is the tesla wall connector it's at a good price it's it delivers up to 48 amps and it has the tesla connector standard so you don't need an adapter you could use one of the other charging stations to charge your tesla uh with the adapter that's provided by tesla when you when you when uh when you buy your tesla comes with the car so you could use any of these but there's no need to to use this for daily charging when tesla has such a good solution i think it's best off to just buy the tesla wall connector now the adapter you just showed that's so uh the tesla charger can uh charge a different car or that the non-tesla charger can draw charge the tesla car so what comes free with your car is this adapter that allows you to charge your tesla with with another charging station let's say you already had one at your house you didn't want to buy another one tesla gives you this for free good on them um but let's say you already own a tesla so you have a tesla wall connector in your garage and now you buy a mustang maki or id4 or any other electric vehicle you see geez i got to go out and get another charging station you know because it has a different connector you don't have to you can buy one of these adapters it's a tesla to j1772 adapter um this is a nice uh tesla tap mini one of my favorite ones and this one's just the tesla tap but the one thing i need to point out this is super important there's a lot of very cheap units of these available today on amazon that are not made well they burn out make sure you get a good quality made one don't go buying the cheapest one that's available it's going to melt the connectors the pins are going to burn out get one that matches the amperage of your car if you have a car that can accept 40 amps make sure you get one that can deliver at least 50 amps oversize it a little bit because i've seen so many nightmare stories of people melting cheap connectors and then damaging their car all right so our next category is portable charging stations what would you call them and what are they so i just call them uh either evse or portable charging equipment and what that is are these smaller units this amazing e that we have here that you would carry around with you in your car a lot of people to have charging equipment in the back of their ev in case they need to plug in on the road some evs come with a nice a portable evsc a level two unit that can charge the car relatively quickly but some cars come with very weak charging equipment as standard a level one unit that trickle charges you only get about three or four miles of range per hour and those owners prefer to go out and buy a nice level two charging unit my favorite are the two from amazing e the amazing e 16 amp portable charging unit and also the amazing e-fast which is a 32 amp unit um why do i amazing e they're super quality that's what i really about amazing more so than uh some of the other portable charging equipment you can find them on amazon there's dozens of them many from companies you've never heard of a lot of them being imported from asia with 30-day or 60-day warranties they're not safety certified they're really not safe to use these units here cost a little more be right up front with you but they're solid units with really good warranties and they're safe you you know you just spent 30 40 50 000 on this brand new ev and now you're trying to save 50 on the charging equipment it really doesn't make sense buy a nice quality unit and it will last you a long time and you won't have any problems with connectors melting or plugs burning out get a good solid unit and you won't regret that decision all right now the the next category is outdoor charging stations because i think it's easy to assume when we talk about home charging it's always inside the garage but a lot of people either don't use their garage or don't have a garage so this is something that is kind of a whole different animal that has to weather literally weather the storm yeah so there's there's a lot of different aspects in charging equipment and if you're gonna buy one to mount it outside there's a few more things that you need to look at uh how well the the cable is if you live in a cold weather area how does that hold up in really frigid cold weathers does it remain nice and bendable and pliable or does it forget a frozen rope and you can't even bend it the the unit also you need to know what the nema waterproof rating is some of these units are have better nema ratings if you're going to mount your unit outside you live in an area where it frequently rains or snows you should look for a nema 4 rated unit the units that i think that are the best for outdoor are clipper creek products clipper creek makes absolutely fantastic products the some of the most durable products they've been around forever clipper creek they're the og of ev charging stations and their units are some of the most robust units available honorable mention goes to the grizzle e that's also a super tough unit this thing can withstand just about anything and also the flow g5 or x5 uh both of these units are made really well they're they're metal encasion enclosure super tough and these three units here in my opinion are the best if you're going to mount them outside and use an outdoor charging solution all right tom and i guess that's it these are all the categories and all the chargers uh thanks so much once again and uh i will see you back on our regularly show for the sunday electric car news very good thanks for having me alex if you want to see the most detailed reviews about every single home charger home charging station that you have seen in this browse to tom's i put a link in the description of this check them out he does all kinds of things to them including shoving them into the freezer it's it's a lot of fun don't forget to to his don't forget to to this this is a great time to hit that button alright looking forward to all of your comments other than that see you guys next time and remember to stay charged,1
E for Electric,PLXAbfWOvf5YtNes11pbNdgq3N5dbZg0Qy,SAQpo7L9IWg,tesla is just about to screw all of its customers or as most loyal of them will call it just being the best car company in the world if you want to hear more from them you can find them in the comments section of this having a meltdown state of charge host and a tesla owner himself tom malogne will be here to give us the perspective from the other side and we're going to start right now [music] welcome to e4 electric don't forget to on that button and the bell notification icon so you don't miss anything moving forward tesla's competition has increased in the last few years and i am proud to be a hot new model for one of them having my work featured in the motor trend's latest coverage check it out my real work in front of the camera is finally paying off i'll pull my muscle but the competition is specially heated up in the last 12 months tesla does no longer hold the top spot for the longest range fastest charging speed first electric truck on the market first semi truck on the market and a few other categories but tesla's supercharger network is still the best in the world and many people choose tesla over its ever growing competition specifically for that reason however it looks that huge advantage is just about to disappear and guess who's allowing for this to happen oh yes this is all part of the master plan don't you see you silly silly id4 drivers tesla is moving forward with opening up its supercharger network to other non-tesla ev owners the filthy infidels me so let's talk about how this is going to affect existing tesla owners and why in the world would tesla voluntarily screw all of them they were elon musk's hot young employees oh you didn't hear funny story you see elon got one of his pretty young employees pregnant while reportedly still with grimes is that to replace one of his other kids who just disowned him as soon as she turned 18 asking for a friend um you know if he was building superchargers as fast as he is building kids i wouldn't even be doing the story so you want to jump back in if you are a current tesla owner you probably know that sometimes before you can wait for your car to charge at a supercharger you have to wait to get the spot to wait for your car to charge at the supercharger now i personally haven't been to a supercharger in a while until a couple of weeks ago when i have decided to help some tesla owners charge out of the f-150 lightning's franc that was a fun day but guess what i saw once i got there besides a few dirty looks from some tesla owners yes a line of several owners waiting for a free stall mind you the electrify america station across the parking lot had plenty of spots and yes you can charge a tesla at an electrify america station you just need an adapter the truth is that even though tesla and elon musk have been bragging about how many new superchargers they have been building they forgot to mention that they still haven't been keeping up with the number of cars they've been selling as a matter of fact very recently inside evs have published an article pointing out that the number of teslas per each supercharger stole has tripled from 263 cars per stall a few years ago to 711 cars per stall in the beginning of this year so things are getting crowded and now imagine all the people me with all kinds of evs having access to the same network i mean good for me a guy with more charging options now but not good for you a guy sitting in line to charge his tesla during the 4th of july weekend so why in the world would tesla allow this to happen well i'll tell you in just a second but before that a quick reminder that this is brought to you by c-can if you've been dying to get a top of the line electric vehicle here's your chance the cken action fund is raffling a tesla model s or irivian electric truck to raise money for their work fighting climate change to buy your raffle tickets use the link in the description of this and by energy pal go in solar but not sure what panels to get whether or not to get a home battery and how much all of this is going to cost well energy pal will do all of that for you and you will get a 500 gift card when your installation is complete if you use the link in the description of this so why would tesla screw its own customers with no care whatsoever in favor of other ev owners well to make you feel a little better they don't care about us either you see this is all about what tesla is getting out of it specifically a lot of money and money over customers has been on brand for elon musk for years now you remember that infrastructure bill that was passed and signed last year well there was a few dollars set aside in that bill for the charging infrastructure and by a few dollars i mean 7.5 billion of them however the catch is that if you wanted some of that sweet uncle sam's money you have to be providing charging services to all of the public rather than just your own brand's customers so in hopes of getting their hands on some of our taxpayer money tesla has decided to screw its own customers who by the way paid and continued to pay for the supercharger network oh and by the way this news did not come from tesla somehow it didn't come up between other more important tweets about mars and some spelling riddles the news came from the white house briefing room stating that tesla is working on the equipment to retrofit the supercharger network in the u.s and those should be ready by the end of the year oh goody just in time for the busy holiday travel all right for more we turn to the host of the state of charge youtube and someone who has contributed to the tesla supercharger network as a tesla owner tom malogne all right tom first of all i'm glad you're making some time for us away from your brand new f-150 lightning which i'm i'm sure you're spending a lot of time with but let's talk about tesla because and you know first of all would you agree that tesla superchargers is a one of the few things that still left as a major advantage for tesla and the reason why a lot of people choose tesla over uh ever growing competition yeah i think that's a hard point to argue against alex i would agree the supercharger network is an enormous advantage that really nobody else has all right so now they're saying they're gonna be opening it up so you know they can get a hold of a lot of money but do you think this is going to be for the show or do you think that they you know ev owners me who don't drive tesla's will actually be able to have access to you know reasonable access to way more charging locations you know i i wish i knew the answer i hope it's not for show i hope that the uh in order to qualify for that the funds that it's well thought out and it's not you can't just add one little ccs plug and make the whole supercharger site eligible for um you know for federal money if there's there's 20 superchargers and there's one ccs plug that really shouldn't qualify for federal funds so it's hard to say at this point will they put them on all tesla superchargers will they sell an adapter and let people use the superchargers with an adapter or would that adapter even allow them to qualify that probably wouldn't even allow them to qualify for the funds so it's probably going to be a hard connector but how many they put per site is really you know nobody knows just yet all right now okay you are a tesla owner and how how are you guys how are test loaners supposed to feel when you know this benefits them none right it benefits people me uh with other evs it certainly benefits tesla and the richest men on earth elon musk but you guys are actually now going to have to deal with more crowded supercharger locations and longer lines and it made how how are tesla owners supposed to feel about this so yeah i'm sure tesla owners are not going to be happy about this they had exclusive network just for their vehicles and now it's going to be opened up at least some percentage of it's going to be opening up we don't know if they're going to retrofit existing stations or not you know the only thing that tesla can do is just keep installing more and more and more supercharger locations so their customers don't feel left out and they're not waiting in line for all of these other vehicles because don't forget you know baked into the price of every tesla part of that money you pay for the car goes to fund supercharger network so you've already put a down payment on using that network and the people from the other evs have it so yeah they're you know tesla has to think this through make sure that they're not making something that's unfair for their customers well let's talk about pricing because you're right this network was bought by people you and me when i used to own a tesla and now people with you know with other uh without avs get the benefits um let's when someone me and someone you arise at the supercharger you're with the tesla me with an another ev how much more should i pay how much you know would it be reasonable to charge me five times as much so don't forget i'm on both sides of the fence now i could pull up with my lightning as well as my tesla so you know um i can i can see it from both sides and you know i would think it would be fair to charge non-tesla evs more i don't know if that would be allowed under this whole agreement because let's say they were to do that let's say they were to install ccs plugs at all the supercharger locations and get that federal money to install you know tens of millions hundreds of millions of dollars to install the stuff and then they charged a dollar a kilowatt hour you know when when the tesla customers were paying 30 cents a kilowatt hour you know that would be defeating the purpose almost nobody would use it so you know i think that if the government is smart and that's a big if when they put this stuff out to bid in somewhere baked into the rules and regulations is going to be that the pricing has to be fair across the board now i'd prefer personally if non-tesla vehicles paid a little bit more for instance a supercharger by me charges 36 cents a kilowatt hour um you know i wouldn't mind paying 45 cents a kilowatt hour to charge my non-tesla there i think that would be fair to me but i don't know if that's going to be allowed that's right what's fair is not always allowed much my presence at the rivian media events but for more fairness that is allowed don't forget to to tom's i put a link to it in the description of this alright looking forward to all of your comments other than that see you guys next time and remember to stay charged [music] you,3
E for Electric,PLXAbfWOvf5YtNes11pbNdgq3N5dbZg0Qy,CUwI3-JzpKQ,how long does it take for an electric car to charge now those of you who are just looking into buying electric cars this will definitely be a very useful but if you already have an electric car you might stick around anyway because a lot of electric car owners still don't know as much as they should about charging for example tesla owners a lot of them still believe that the fastest chargers are the tesla superchargers charging their cars that's not true so if you if you thought that maybe you should stick around but i have a perfect person to talk about it today because tom milani is joining us for his a weekly segment plugged in with tom milani and tom well everyone's been hoarding toilet paper and sand sanitizer tom has been hoarding the indoor chargers this is literally his home and this is not even the end of it so over the years as he's been testing them and working with them he really is pretty much the best expert i know if not the best expert out there on a charging and not just in home so he's gonna be here to explain to all of us really and every time tom is here i learned something new so told all of us about three different levels of charging by the way tom is here every week so don't forget to to this just at least for that very reason and of course he did the notification icon so don't miss and you think moving forward and of course before i bring in tom quick reminder that this in this is sponsored by buyten check out the all electric suv called mbyte coming to the us and europe absolutely no money down to get your reservation so go to the description of this to reserve your bitin today in evan x the aftermarket accessories for tesla use efore electric the name of this as a discount code for all purchases over $100 alright without further ado let me bring in tom and tom how are you doing and can you tell us everything about electric car charging well we need a little bit longer than our segment to do that but i'm doing fine safe here in new jersey my wife and i are you know barricaded in our house now and trying to limit our contact being good citizens we should probably mention that we're taping this during the coronavirus lockdown even though people might be watching this a year later when they completely forgot about it and it's back to jay-z and trump tweeting and all of that stuff so we're in a bit of a you know a pickle here right now well i hope we've forgotten about it in a year from now let's just go on the premise that that'll be the case let's hope so yeah there's there's there's a lot to discuss with electric car charging you know a lot of people want to know how long does it charge take to charge an electric car and you know that that's a question that's constantly been kind of evolving back when i first started driving electric about 11 years ago it was many hours to charge your electric car there weren't very high speed charging there was very little public infrastructure most of the early electric cars would charge either on a 110 outlet or at a 240 volt outlet at your home but that's changed and we now have kind of evolved into a 3-tier charging system your we have a picture of a basic 120 volt level one charger up on the screen now that was the the unit that was provided with my bmw i3 most electric cars come with an evs ii that's called electric vehicle supply or service equipment most of them will come with a hundred and twenty volt unit that some of the newer electric cars now have been coming with better equipment 240 volt eb se or charger which is what tesla has always supplied with their cars but some of the other manufacturers now are kind of catching up and saying hey that thats low level one charger isn't good enough so we need to provide our customers with something a little better so let's go over the as i said the levels of charging we'll start out with level one level one charging is regular household 120 volt outlet here in the us a little bit different in europe because they have standard 230 volt household currents so the cars are gonna charge a little bit quicker but for the purpose of this we're really going to be talking about north america and the electric supply that we have here so regular household outlet is 120 volt outlet you can charge your electric car on that outlet you could just plug it in at home and charge it with the proper 120 volt bbse but it's gonna take a while because it only charges at about 3 to 5 miles of charge per hour its delivers about 1 kilowatt of electricity per hour so that's okay if you have a plug-in hybrid with a smaller battery or perhaps if you don't drive a lot and you don't need to replenish a lot of your battery every day now before the people that charge exclusively on 120 volts jump down our throat yes some people live with that just fine and it's and it's enough charging for them but the vast majority of people when they get an electric car are gonna want a 240 volt charging source and then you're jumping up to level 2 charging if you're using 240 volts now those are we have up on the screen there three of the smaller portable 240 volt evse or chargers that you can buy today they're lightweight they're portable and they're lower powered than some of the bigger units that you would see hanging on the wall that alex showed you earlier hanging on my garage some of those units are higher powered now they're both they're all level 2 units because they accept 240 volts but for instance those small it's that we had pictured before they'll deliver 16 amps of electricity and that'll give you three three and a half kilowatts of power the higher powered units that you see hanging on the wall the tesla wall connector for instance they'll deliver anywhere from say 24 amps up to 48 amps of power so they'll deliver somewhere between 15 to 20 miles of range per hour up to 45 miles of range per hour that's a significant difference in a significant upgrade from the 4 to 5 miles of range per hour that you can get on level one so for that reason many people would prefer to install a 240 volt charging equipment in their garage or at their home now if the concern is can i install it you should be able to you don't need any kind of special electric for your house it's basically the same as a circuit for an electric clothes dryer or an electric range you basically put two 120 volt circuits together to get 240 volts but the could have a problem if you have a older home that has a smaller service a maybe a hundred amp main for the house exactly what i had i had to upgrade mine to 200 from 100 it's very common at least here in california yeah the pay thats regionally specific you know there are some areas that are better than others and certain ages of the homes so the that if if you you know the best thing we always to tell people is if you're gonna consider getting an electric car and you're not really sure have an electrician come to your house and ask him hey can i add a 240 volt circuit here can i add a dedicated 40 amp or 60 amp 240 volt circuit without having to upgrade my service that way you have an idea of whether or not you're gonna be able to do this for a few hundred dollars or a few thousand dollars if you need to install a whole new upgraded service so it's a good idea to understand where you're at before you make that electric car purchase we've i've heard stories of people that have went out and bought an electric car and they get it home and they really didn't research the charging and now they're in for three or four thousand dollars to upgrade their service they weren't budgeted for that so be ready and actually have an electrician come out and take a look at your service before you make the plunge and get the evie more than likely you won't have to upgrade your service but as alex had to and many other people have to it is a possibility yeah and actually the reason i had to was because i also had at that time i had to and also my bull doesn't think that much amperage but my tesla the night when i had it took a lot right especially some had on board double i believe double charger so that took a lot of energy you can go up to 80 amps with those so that's that's um that's pretty much your entire house yeah it could be as much power as the whole house has the capability of right blank right well let me say one thing people sometimes get a little too wound up in how much power they have to deliver to their car you know you had a tesla that could draw you had the dual onboard chargers so we could accept up to 80 amps it didn't mean you had to give it eighty i did not it would have charged just fine if you would have installed the 30 amp or a 40 amp charger you would have still been fully charged every morning when you leave your house and that's really the goal without charging you want to make sure that you could charge quick enough so that even if your battery is depleted one night you and you plug it in by the next morning when you're leaving for work or to do whatever you do your car's fully charged so just because your car can accept 80 amps alex doesn't mean you have to go out by this 80 amp charger and put in a new service yeah some people get a little tied up with that and and they especially new tv purchasers because there's they're so concerned that they're not going to be fully charged that go out and make sure they get the highest power possible and it's not always necessary to be honest right well in my case actually didn't really matter whether i upgraded to a 32 amp or 80 amp i just needed a new panel anyway and that cost me and i got a great deal of thirty thousand dollars though of course you know all if you own a house and you only had a hundred amp panel you're probably gonna end up upgrading it sooner or later yeah so um now we should probably you know a pause here and talk about people who live in apartment complexes because you know in most states or at least in a lot of states your landlord i believe if it's more than six unit building your landlord cannot prohibit you from getting a charging station as long as you pay for it let's talk a little bit about that and how expensive would that be sometimes more sometimes less obviously you have it flip-flop use i think you said in most states they'll let the landlord cannot prohibit you it's actually the opposite in in most areas they can private you different states and different municipalities now are making these laws that are kind of these right to charge laws where they they they if you want if you live in the apartment and you want to install charging equipment you have the right to as long as you pay the full expense that isn't the case in most states now in most areas that the landlord or the condo association they have the final say wow i stand corrected that's why i have you here to to make sure that we get that i wasn't there i was under depression that these laws are kind of taking over the country but i guess we mean they are starting to they're starting to gain traction in more areas i've been fighting for what we call right to charge laws here in new jersey for seven or eight years now and it's definitely starting to take a hold and some of the local politicians are putting it up for votes so we're definitely getting some traction with that but we're still a long way from that as it is now if you live in a condo for instance you have to get permission from the condo association to live in an apartment complex you've got to talk to the owner and see if they'll let you install the charger they can always say no i don't want it it's a safety hazard people might trip on the cord i'm gonna have to get more insurance these are all the things that we've heard a lot of them i think are not really sensical arguments but nonetheless in many cases people just don't want to deal with anything extra if they own in magic managed property so their answer is just know without even really thinking about yeah let go if you if you live in an apartment or condo it could be a little bit more difficult to get charging that's another thing that you need to investigate before you go out and get the car now let me ask you what if somebody lives in a place where there is a garage so an actual garage so someone's renting a house or a duplex or whatever and there is a washing dryer so a dryer electric outlet 240 outlet can you plug an electric car into that same outlet that your dryer goes to yes you would be able to as long as you can get a able that's long enough because one of the problems with sometimes electric dryers or ranges is they're not located in convenient places where you can get your car close to it but there are some in garages and some located right near the exterior of the house and you can definitely charge from one of those circuits provided you get the charging equipment that matches the the circuit the supply circuit because there's there's there's 30 amp circuits as 40 amp circuits as 50 amp circuits you need to make sure you match your equipment with your supply and that's where an electrician can help you decide what what you can install and what you can buy all right well i think we've card everything for the level 2 now so let's go to the top level ok so that the fastest charging is dc fast charge a lot of people refer to it as level 3 and that makes sense because we have level 1 we have level 2 so would be faster than that must be level three but it actually really is called dc fast charge and dc is direct current level one and level two that you have in your house is ac it's alternating current it's a different type of electricity so with the dc fast charge the there's no need to have inverter in your car the lectures do go straight into the battery so we can charge at a higher rate what happens when you charge at home on level one and level two is you get your your electricity is ac it goes into the car through your inverter it gets converted to dc where it goes into the battery and that's kind of a bottleneck so with dc fast charge it's dc going right into a dc battery it doesn't have to go through charging equipment in the vehicle so we can come in at a much higher rate and charger your vehicle a lot quicker so these things these dc fast chargers you wouldn't install one of those in your home you wouldn't really have the capability to and if you did it would be really expensive it would probably cost more than your electric car to actually put one in so what you see these are along major corridors along highways shopping centers places where are it's kind of an attraction a shopping mall and more and more of them are popping up on only a few years ago there were almost no dc fast charges in the country and it made long-distance travel in an electric vehicle very very difficult if not nearly impossible ten years ago but tesla really came out of the box strong and started installing what they call their supercharger network and that's just for tesla cars but for all the other makes they needed dc fast chargers also the only problem is none of the manufacturers are willing to really do what tesla did and invest maybe hundreds of millions of dollars and put in this this network so the other manufacturer was all kind of waited for third parties to do with these these charging infrastructure companies luckily although it did take time we're starting to get a trim men this amount of traction in that area and we've got companies electrify america evie go charge point uh are starting to really really accelerate dc fast charge dobson elect electric electrify america alone they started installing their dc fast chargers in the us about twenty one twenty two months ago they didn't have one in the ground now they have over two thousand in in a little over less than two years so you know you think about that rate a hundred a month and it's it's not slowing down you've got evie go has even i think slightly more in the ground then electrify america has it this time so what we're seeing now is kind of an arms race with with dc fast chargers and everybody wants to be the biggest and the best so that's good for the consumer because there's a lot of competition and we shall one show it isn't good for the consumer unlike tesla superchargers is that all these different networks have all different pricing structures and it's very difficult to understand how much your car is going to charge because all unlike gasoline you might go to a gas station and they pay three dollars a gallon here and down the road it's 310 or 320 it's kind of the same well electric vehicle dc fast charging it's not the same at all you can charge on one dc fast charger and it'll cost you ten dollars and you can go to another 110 miles away and of course forty dollars it's that much of a difference so it's still kind of the wild west with with electric vehicle charging rates all these different networks of all different pricing then you have charge point who doesn't set the pricing they just sell the equipment and whoever buys it and they decide to set their own pricing so charge point public charging pricing is the greatest variation there's plenty of stations that are actually free and then their stations that cost a crazy amount of money so you know right now the thing you can do to really understand how much it's gonna cost you on a dc fast charger is use a good app plug share and it tells you the rates so you can kind of just pull out the app see where you're gonna charge and you'll see what it's going to cost you tesla has consistent rates it tells you on their app many of the tesla owners have free charging if they get referrals they get free super charging miles so it's it's a much smaller problem and tesla really basically just charges what the electricity costs in the area so you're you're almost paying as little as you would if you were charging at home which is actually really great for their customers but you know that's as far as what it costs now how about the charging rates because we weren't talking about how long does it take to charge your electric car we talked about level one it charges in about three to five miles per hour of charging level two will charge it somewhere between 15 and 45 miles per hour of charging with dc fast it's almost per minute because you can charge up to 1200 miles an hour on a dc fast charger and since no electric car can actually go 1200 miles per charge you wouldn't need to charge for an hour for a long time tesla superchargers were the fastest chargers around they charged at 120 kilowatts and that was when no other dc fast charger could charge more than 50 kilowatts but now in the last couple years we're starting to get these ultra fast dc fast chargers come out and they were charging at a hundred and fifty kilowatts now electrify america and some other companies have three hundred and fifty kilowatt dc fast chargers so the they're upping the bar here we go with the dc fast arms race but not everybody can accept that kind of charge rate just because you're at a 350 kilowatt dc fast charger doesn't mean your electric car can charge at 300 for the kilowatts the car limits what it can accept so take for instance a bmw i3 or a nissan leaf you're stuck at 50 kilowatt so no matter what dc fast charging your charge run you can't accept more than 50 kilowatts then there's cars the jaguar i paced i can do about a hundred kilowatts you've got the audi e-tron that can do 150 kilowatts and now you've got the big bed porsche tyco on who can who is the the king i guess of dc fast charging and it can accept 270 kilowatts and what's the top tesla what's the top loraine for tesla right now with a model 3 so the model 3 can accept up to i think 250 or 270 to the watts they're they're their new superchargers that they're really just starting to install there's only a few in the ground yet they can deliver 250 kilowatts now if you have a model s or a model x you still can't charge at that rate the new model s raven will be able to but the model s's that are out today i think they're capped at 120 or 150 because their battery cells are different than what's in the model 3 model 3 batteries are a little bit different they can accept the higher charge rate but but still to date there aren't a lot of the hunt the 250 kilowatt v3 superchargers i've never i haven't come across one yet when i'm driving my mile 3 but they are coming and that tesla's gonna be right up there with porsche for the fastest charging electric vehicle out there so we're talking about rate with it on a dc fast charger it depends on what your car can accept but typically most electric cars can charge to about 80% in a half an hour or less so if you need to stop at a dc fast charger you're probably only going to be there for somewhere between 20 minutes and 45 minutes depending on how much you need to charge and depending of there is a line because sometimes that happens during holidays and really busy locations now let me just clarify a couple of things i just want to make sure everything's super clear that tesla has it's a network of a supercharger specifically just for ours here in north america it's different in the in europe where they usually actually a more common center of ccs now the other networks that you talked about alex for america eve ago and so forth they can charge you either at ccs or chatham oh still old-school but there are some cars out there still needs animo and it is the it is the electrify america that has the fastest possible charge rate at 350 kilowatts though there's no cars out there who can actually take that just wanted to kind of clarify that and make sure that i got that right so there are some other companies are coming out with 350 kilowatt dc fast chargers besides electrify america so they're not gonna be the only ones that have ultra-high charge charge rates so but that that's changing quickly now as we also to remind everyone only tesla cars can use tesla superchargers but tesla cars can use the chargers from the other networks if it has a chatham o plug because tesla sells an adapter that course i think about $400 and you can plug your tesla into an electrifying america or or eb go station or charge point station as long as you have this chatham o adapter you are then limited to 50 kilowatts so your your tesla's gonna charge a lot slower than what it would on a tesla supercharger but if you need to charge and there's no superchargers in the area it's worth having that car if you do a lot of crazy road trips and you want to be able to charge anywhere that you can it's not a bad idea to have the tesla chatham o adapter and in europe tesla's can charge at pretty much all other fast charging metals because they do have a ccs plug which i wish would kind of convert everything here but it's too late for that yeah and they have the in europe they have a tesla two ccs adapter so if your car has a teslic plug and you want to use ccs you can use the adapter now ccs europe is called ccs - it's different than the ccs in the u.s. we have ccs one so the plug is slightly different so in the us and canada there is no tesla ccs adapter there that's only for europe and as you mentioned the new model freeze now are actually shipping with a ccs plug built into the car on inlet they're not using their proprietary tesla inlet yeah all right well listen i'm we and we only this is pretty much the overall information that everybody needs to you know really educate themselves before they buy in an electric car to see which one is for them and if they're even ready to buy one so i appreciate the information i know we'll be we'll be covering this topic over and over again the technology moves pretty quickly so thanks for hanging out with me and i will see you next week thanks alex be well alright well so it's i know it's kind of a lot of information i know but this is a very important especially before you're buying a car whether you already have an electric car or you don't have it doesn't really matter whatever your next car is gonna be you might want to make sure that you will kind of a match what you can do for the car and what the car can do for you and of course you want to talk about you know you know whether or not you need the long-distance fast charging or you don't do it very often and then you your your needs are just not just not and in a lot of times people just have one car to drive around in the city i just made a for where you can you can get cars for under ten thousand dollars that i used that only have 50 60 70 mile range and then you have another car where the electric or gas that you're actually used for long distance trips so let us know in the comments section if you guys have any comments me and tom will be happy to answer that and maybe make another based on what you guys share i'm asking but those of course don't forget to follow tom on social media including twitter that's where it gets really interesting but also there's a link in the description of this to all of his articles on inside iv's all right we are looking forward to your comments other than that see you guys next time and remember to stay charged [music],1
E for Electric,PLXAbfWOvf5YtNes11pbNdgq3N5dbZg0Qy,YeWq47CTDmE,this brand new smartphone is absolutely useless well mainly because it is not charged and now i can't post pictures of my fancy sushi dinners or cruise vacations and yes that's me being hugged by a sloth so my life is pretty much over unless i have one of these the charger and look boom the universe makes sense again cancel my therapist now when it comes to electric cars things are not that much different and since the best most convenient and the cheapest way to charge your electric car is at home your home charger is the biggest most important purchase you will ever make for your ev but how much do you need to spend on your home charger and what chargers are the best on the budget meaning it will charge your car without burning down your house is always a nice perk and guess what i have the best person in the world no joke to answer the question he'll be here in just one second and we're going to start right now [music] welcome to e4 electric and no you can't just buy the cheapest charger on amazon and call it a day it's one of those things when you cannot afford to buy cheap it is a high voltage electric device that can cause some big trouble including burning down your house but it doesn't mean you have to spend a fortune on it either so what to do what to do and what to do is to ask the best expert in the world in electric car charging tom maloney who is a veteran ev journalist and a host of the biggest ev charging on youtube appropriately named state of charge now when i asked tom to come on and talk to us about the top five most affordable home chargers he told me that the minimum budget for anything he can vouch for would have to be around 5 500 dollars all right fair enough before i bring tom in to walk us through all five chargers a quick reminder that this is brought to you by electron look one of the biggest challenges with owning an ev is finding convenient and reliable ways of charging it that's why electron is pioneering great charging solutions that let you charge where you want when you want regardless of your charging standard their ccs to tesla adapter which lets tesla drivers charge up to 300 amps at any ccs fast charger across the country with the charging rate of up to 150 kilowatts it can allow for up to 180 miles of range per hour get one today using the discount code in the description of this alright tom let's talk about affordable home chargers but before we get to the list what makes an affordable but also good home charger so on the affordable alex you know there's if you look at the market now there's so many charges out there that cost 600 700 800 i took a look at 500 and less i consider that affordable because that's on the low end of a charger that is relatively high powered uh level two charger what makes a charger good well there's a lot of things that it should be built well it should have a good warranty it should um be safety certified it should have a nice long cable a good strong well-made connector and a nice connector holster there's a lot of things that i use when i judge if a charger is a good charger or not all right now i know you test almost all of them yourself and you put them literally through hell but the most entertaining part of your videos is what you call a deep freeze when you take the charger and put it in the freezer uh and then leave it there overnight but uh you know humor me this uh what uh what is the a good boy from new jersey yourself doing with a commercial ice cream freezer and what do you use it for when you're not testing home chargers so i actually bought this just to freeze the chargers um you know many freezers only go down to zero degrees fahrenheit but commercial ice cream chests go way below that because ice cream has to be kept way below freezing otherwise it gets soft so i actually went out and bought a commercial ice cream freezer so i could do these cable deep freeze tests and the goal is for me to get the the charger down to about negative 15 degrees fahrenheit for 24 hours then to see how well the cable bends because this is really for people that live in the northern states alex if you live in san diego or southern texas you don't have to worry about this too much but in areas where it's going to get down way below freezing overnight think about it if your vehicle is parked outside and your charger's out outside some people's chargers are mounted outside when you get to your car in the morning you go to unplug it and you've got a frozen rope and the cable won't even bend so i do this to see how pliable and how easy the cable is going to be to work with on those really cold nights every time you do it man it's always entertaining but let's get to the list and are these in any particular order no no i just threw out you know you you said give me give me some of your top picks for good chargers that are affordable and that's what i gave you all right let's get going with number one okay so number one we're going to talk about the grizzle e classic the grizzly classic is a 40 amp non-smart charger now there's chargers or smart chargers means they typically come with an app and they're wi-fi enabled and you can manipulate things through your app you can start and stop a charging session you could check out data but not a lot of people are really concerned with that some most people just want the charger to just charge their car and and that's it and be reliable and the grizzly does that it's it's very well made it's made of uh it's it's got a really thick outer aluminum casing most chargers are plastic these days even though some of the plastic's strong this uh this is an incredibly tough uh thing that grizzly actually drove over it with cars and everything to prove how tough it was uh and it's it's a really well made uh charger uh it's got a nice long cable and it's kind of the no-nonsense if you just want something that's going to be reliable and affordable and work then this is definitely one of your considerations all right now the next one is i believe it's amazing eve past yeah so you know um the amazing e is a line of portable chargers they're small chargers they're portable from a clipper creek and uh so the amazing e-fest is a 32 amp portable charger it's very small very lightweight you can carry it with you it plugs into a nema 1450 outlet it'll deliver uh up to uh 7.7 kilowatts and it's good for a portable charging unit now there are competitive units out there on the market that cost less than this most of them are not safety certified most of them don't have good warranties i this unit because it's really built tough and it's going to last a long time and i'd rather see people spend a couple dollars more but get a really good well-made product now this is a really good well-made product and it's available for around 400 and you know portable uh chargers you don't have to have it mounted on the wall and you wired it just requires a 240 outlet correct that's correct you know um i tend to recommend for your home charging use the charger you're going to use every day i to see that hardwired because it eliminates a point of failure an outlet is a point of failure but that doesn't work for everybody and what i about these portable units are is you can take them on the road for different places so you could charge at your house some people have second homes here in new jersey down the jersey shore or they have a a winter home up in vermont or connecticut and uh they have all they have to do is install an outlet there and plug in i have friends that have evs that installed out let's say at their parents house their parents live 80 miles away so they just had to install the outlet they didn't have to buy the charging equipment because they just unplugged their charger and go to their parents house plug it in when they're there and then they can they have enough juice to get home all right now uh number three is the tesla mobile connector yeah so tesla makes outstanding charging equipment i i almost think you know i love tesla vehicles i think tesla makes really good electric vehicles i almost think they're charging equipment compared to other charging equipment is better than their cars are better compared to other evs tesla really makes good charging all of it and we're not going to talk about all of their chargers here today but two two out of the three so we talked about the mobile connector the tesla mobile connector is a dual voltage connector which means it can charge from 120 volt source regular household outlet here in north america or it can charge from a 240 volt outlet nema 1450 outlet so uh depending on what type of outlet you have available you can use this on either uh supply and uh it's a very good small lightweight unit it comes with a 20-foot cable nice cable comes in a nice handy carrying case and for 230 dollars is what tesla charges for this it's a ridiculously good deal um it's it's it may be one of the best deals you can buy of any charging equipment out there today and does it only charge teslas or can you charge any electric car so out of the bag it'll only charge tesla's because it has the tesla connector but you can buy a tesla to j1772 adapter and use it to charge any electric vehicle all right well the next one is the wall connector from tesla how is this one different again tesla so tesla's wall connector is their permanently mounted hardwired connector that gets mounted on your wall it's not portable um and uh it's 48 amps it can deliver uh up to 11.5 kilowatt which is a is is pretty much most electric vehicles top out at being able to accept 11.5 kilowatt now some of the newer evs were really big batteries can accept uh up to 80 amps which is 19.2 kilowatts but for all intents and purposes the the uh the 48 amp 11.5 chargers the tesla wall connector are pretty much as powerful as most people would need and tesla sells it for 425 dollars it's a fantastic value and again you can just buy that and then get an adapter uh to charge your uh j1772 vehicle tesla also sells a version of this with a j1772 connector but they charge geez i think it's a hundred dollars more so that pushed it up over 5 hundred dollars that's why it's not on this list here today but you can get uh the wall connector and charge any electric vehicle with it if you're just buy an adapter all right uh the last but not least is emporia charger yeah so the emporia um charger is relatively new it's been out for about a year now i think maybe slightly more and honestly it's a fantastic charger at a fantastic price it's 399 dollars most comparable chargers on the market today that can do what the emporia can do uh cost at least two hundred dollars more it's a 48 amp charger and it's a smart charger it has a y it has an app wi-fi connected and emporia sells a whole ecosystem of energy monitoring and energy saving devices and um for instance with this emporia charger if you buy what they call the emporio view or the view 2 i think it's called it's it's another piece of equipment you need to buy from emporia and you have solar electric you can use the two to only charge your ev from xs solar production so the solar that your house isn't using will trickle fee the battery on the on your car so you can say my car is only charged with solar electricity and and there's very few uh chargers out there that can do that uh so it's got a lot of options and at the price at the 399 it's just a sick deal honestly it it may be the best deal available out there today i mean the tesla wall connector is an awesome deal the tesla mobile connector is a fantastic deal but for a permanently mounted uh you know 48 amp charger to hang on the wall of your garage it's tough to beat the emporia these days all right well listen i gotta ask you this one out of these five what would be your top pick you know alex that's i i i'm such a nerd there's things i about each one of these chargers i love the fact that the tesla wall connector can they call it daisy chain and that means you can you can share one circuit and add a bunch of chargers so it'd have to be between the wall connector and the emporia um they're not your children you can pick one it's okay they're all my children look i know they are okay i'm gonna qualify if i owned a tesla i would probably get the wall connector if i owned any other electric vehicle probably the emporia all right that's that's that's the that's you know listen anything that's on your list as we talked about it before the uh is a good product so thanks so much for uh doing this and i will see you here next time thanks for having me alex well there you go if you want to know more about the commercial ice cream freezers or electric car chargers whatever tickles your fancy with extensive reviews and ratings from tom don't forget to to his i put a link to it in the description of this alright looking forward to all of your comments other than that see you guys next time and remember to stay charged [music],1
E for Electric,PLXAbfWOvf5YtNes11pbNdgq3N5dbZg0Qy,RyeCae8s7Lk,biggest news of the year so far for tesla may just be its worst it's just no one knows it yet and in case you haven't heard gm and ford have come crawling to tesla crying oh we don't have anywhere for our customers to charge and we didn't build our own charging network can we pretty use yours and instead of saying hells no people buy our cars a lot because of our great supercharger network and we're not gonna just get rid of our biggest advantage sheesh instead of saying that they said yeah why not you can use it and you know what you can even start selling your own cars with our charging port and of course all of the tesla fans have praised the deal by the supreme leader saying uh look at how much money tesla is going to make on all the ford and gm evs charging at superchargers and paying tesla money but what they're forgetting is that tesla has already committed to making 7500 superchargers at pretty much all locations available for not just ford and gm but all evs out of the goodness of elon musk's heart i'm just kidding here doesn't have one it was for the sweet sweet taxpayer money from the infrastructure bill and don't get me wrong the tesla connector is about and i did the math a million i came up with a million times better than the ccs one but do we really want such an important standard controlled by just one automaker well to answer this and many other questions about this deal i will be joined by the industry's leading expert on ev charging and the host of the state of charge youtube tom maloney but before that a quick reminder that this is brought to you by ckn action fund one of the nation's best non-profits fighting climate change just launched yet another ev raffle you could win in lucid air with a 500 mile battery or a rivian suv plus 10 years of free charging or a tesla model x the second action fund that one ops itself every year with these raffle prizes while using the proceeds to promote clean energy for complete terms and to enter the raffle visit evraffle.org tickets are just two hundred dollars and no more than 5500 will be sold all right tom uh let's get something out of the way is there a consumer alive right now who would prefer the you know the bulky ccs plug over the sexy easy to use come to mama tesla plug yeah i don't think so alex unless maybe you worked on the sae board that designed j1772 and you think it's your baby other than that there's really no advantage and i don't see why anybody would prefer it over the uh the nax connector it's a very ugly and fat baby for sure all right but this is where uh the whole deal stops making sense to me because obviously this is great that we're going to be moving to to that plug i liked it so much better just everybody else but what is tesla getting out of this i that that they weren't going to get in the next couple of years with with the infrastructure bill can you explain that to me well you know i think tesla's playing the long game with this alex and initially they might not really be benefiting but it is a benefit to the company down the road when there's tens of millions of electric vehicles and everybody is using one connector their connector uh the the they there's a lot of money to be made with people accessing using their supercharger network and them basically charging them for the energy no i get it yeah but they're going to achieve that and they can't achieve it at any time they've already started converting their uh or adding the magic dog as as a scold where people of four gm and any other ev uh can charge at the supercharger why make a deal with these two manufacturers because that's introducing an adapter and it's a you know it's it's actually a pretty elegant solution the way they did it i've charged on the magic dock i've charged my lightning on the magic dock superchargers but it's only adding another element of cost another layer of something that can break those are going to break eventually with people pulling them in and out putting them in incorrectly maybe even stealing them so you know it's it's adding it would it's going to add a lot of cost and complexity to the superchargers and it's unnecessary if they can just have people use the next all right but there is no at least in the next couple of years it's just no benefit for tesla besides getting more people to their with the magic docs it's just it's just a cosmetic improvement right well we don't know really what's going on behind the scenes the the fact that the other major oems in north america are switching over to the next connector might mean that it opens up even more federal funding with the navi funds for tesla we we don't this is so early we don't really know exactly how it's going to play out alex but it is a very good long-term move for the company and look at look what happened to their stock so it's it it has paid so much immediate dividends this is why i don't talk about stock on this stock never makes sense to me in generally but it has nothing to do with consumers i don't care about tesla investors what i care about is you know ev consumers and you know this is good for the av consumers as we agree in the beginning but you know is this good for tesla uh drivers because you know we've talked about it a while back when tesla uh you know was committed to retrofitting you know what up to 7 500 um or or making the 7500 uh charging stations where you can charge your car with ccs uh port um you know but that means that there will be more and more and more people using tesla superchargers uh and every time i talk to a tesla i don't even have to talk they talk to me in the comment section right and their point is i chose tesla because and number one reason ever almost every time is not the car itself but the supercharger network now they are going to lose that advantage so and anybody can buy any car any any electric car and use the supercharger network so uh is this is this going to damper you know know the experience for tesla the current tesla driver and future trend tesla drivers yeah i mean i i don't see how it's a good for tesla drivers uh the only way you could say is as i went as i said earlier long game it's going to be more revenue for tesla and down the road you know the more profitable the company is maybe they can sell vehicles at a lower cost or maybe they can just continue to install more supercharger locations at a breakneck speed they've been and uh and and and have more sites that will help ease the uh overcrowding that could happen once everybody can use the stations but no the clean and simple answer is i don't think it's good for tesla owners i don't think it's terrible for them but it's definitely not a good move for them all right well that's that's i guess where i always have a problem when something is bad for tesla owners even though a lot of them involved with it but all right but you know isn't tesla how sweet is the money that that tesla's going to receive because of this uh for them because i'm sure they know to remove the biggest advantage that that their own uh drivers their own customers uh brag about which is the supercharger network i mean isn't isn't this going to really drive uh some of the consumers uh to other brands where before that they didn't consider it but now we can buy a ford and gm or whatever and use the supercharger network yeah well for sure you know i've i've even had you i've had my followers tell me i really wanted to get the mustang maki for instance or ionic 5 but the public charging experience is so lacking that i ended up buying a model y because i know i could just get where i need to go and uh now that those vehicles will have access eventually you know through an adapter at least the the ford will natively um it's going to uh make it a little bit more difficult to sell the teslas but evidently tesla feels they can hold their own and their vehicles are good enough to compete even if you remove that exclusivity that they had which was the supercharger network tesla must feel our vehicles can can can can hold their own against the competition even if the charging is all on a level playing field a tesla can feel however they want to feel but their customers feel that that's a big advantage so okay we'll see i i think for you know for next few years every ev that's made except for the honda e and the mazda whatever they just it's going to be sold uh before it it comes off the production line but um but let me ask you this do you think it's good that one brand you know that hasn't been that you know friendly to consumers sometimes and to definitely their competition not that they should be um control such an important part of uh ev ownership as the charging standard you know it is isn't isn't isn't that going to be a problem yeah so um that is a bit of a problem uh we we don't know exactly how all this is going to play out alex i know i've said that before but the truth of the matter is we don't um it's it's not good for one company to control it it's not really technically a standard if one company just controls it what hasn't been you know reviewed and and uh had other people involved making decisions uh which sometimes that's a good thing but moving forward once all the manufacturers have adopted the knacks and i believe they all are going to eventually uh you know i would it would be really good to see some sort of a a a a board where you know it's it's it's it's everybody has some skin in the game and it's not just tesla controlling this now i have faith that ford and gm would not have negotiated with tesla and accepted that connector and put it on their future vehicles if they weren't assured somehow certainly that tesla wouldn't be a bad actor in this you know get them to all switch over to nax and then you know put on some kind of crazy strict rules and change things that were advantageous for them these big companies you know go through layers and layers of lawyers and and i have to believe that this has all been discussed in that at some point uh there'll be other people that will be involved with uh the the nax connector to make it say a proper standard now let's talk about ford and gm i mean do you do you see this deal as a a an admission of borderline embarrassing defeat no not at all uh and it's a little perplexing to me when i see that uh people commenting that it's not ford and gm made ccs and said this is what our connector is this is what you know the the this is what we're going to use because we developed it they didn't that was what was available to them when when tesla when ford and gm started making the their electric vehicles they couldn't use the tesla connector they weren't allowed to so you know wait a second but but but you're pretending they they they they don't have any money you know i mean these companies have plenty of money they definitely had more money that tesla had when they started the supercharger network right of course why couldn't they've won you know each of them at least try to to create one of their own but really uh bond together and create a network for for the ccs standard i mean they haven't even tried so you mean accept the ccs standard but then then they create the network build out the infrastructure i wasn't sure what you're asking yeah yeah absolutely what tesla did i did make the right i feel it yeah no i feel it's so easy for these companies to to compete with tesla because tesla has pioneered pretty much everything and all they have to do is copy them and they can't even do that they can't even copy someone else's homework well i think what it comes down to is they don't want to they they don't want and i've had conversations with so many different oems over the last 15 years that i've been doing this alex and every single manufacturer comes back and says look we don't make gas stations we don't sell gas we're not in the business of selling fuel we're in the business of making vehicles then the customers get the fuel somewhere else and and and you you can argue with it let me finish let me finish you can argue that point and say it's a bad business decision now with electric vehicles because tesla's proving that it seems it's a good thing but that's the answer they don't want to get into the business of selling electricity volkswagen didn't want to do it either they were forced to with the with the with the fines because of the diesel gate well it's not an answer it's an excuse you know because it is definitely possible they had so much more money than them and now they have to admit the defeat that hey listen we could make it work uh we now have to go to our competitor bow to them and put essentially their you know creation into our crappy cars i don't mean traffic cars but you know what i mean into our crappy design that that didn't hold up and because we couldn't put together a charging network it's not their crappy design no because they didn't ford gm didn't say let's get together and make um you know the the the the the the ccs and j1772 connector uh you know it's not their thing failed that was what the standard was and that's why they put her on their vehicles um you know that's fine it's definitely not an admission we can't do anything the way i see it at least in my view is they're saying look we we're looking at the field of public charging and tesla has such a better charging experience we want our customers to have a better charging experience so we're going to adopt that connector there's no admission or failure that stuns me that's just that's such a weird logic you know it's with this google and android said well we couldn't figure something out so instead of figuring that out you know even though it was given to us we decided to go to apple and and and pay the money to uh well how do you know they paid the money how do you know if they paid the money or even not the pay the money well i mean soon listen there's obviously if you're going to be letting uh tesla you know using the tesla's another companies doesn't matter in other companies uh technology you're bowing down to them you're admitting the defeat that you guys couldn't figure it out and and you know but they weren't trying to figure out they weren't trying to make it a better connector they just want to make the cars they just want the cars to charge somewhere in a good listen easy for their customers they're not trying to make chargers connectors but they now but but listen the game has changed you know the game has changed tesla has given them 10 years to say listen this is what we're doing and with every day you could see tesla being more and more and more successful they they beat them in so many different ways i mean i don't to talk about stock but you know their most valuable a valued uh manufacturer right now they're model y is a best-selling uh amazing at what point i mean at what point do they go hey you know what those guys are doing a tesla we should probably try to do something similar and by the way they have so much more power because they're all using ccs port they can all create a a subsidiary or whatever a company that will kick superchargers network ass if they wanted to but the fact that they didn't that is admitting defeat if you ask me so yeah they could they could all let's say all the automakers said we're each going to put a billion dollars in a pot and and you know have 15 billion dollars and and and just go out there and install ccs charging everywhere they could do that you're right but that doesn't mean it's going to work better the the reason why they covet the tesla connector and the tesla charging experience alex is because it just works better it's a better standard the ccs standard is not a tightly written standard that people interpret it different i was just at the char and organization into our operability conference and and and i learned so much there basically what the engineers there told me was so because i asked them flat out well how why does we have why do we have these problems why does their interoperability issues how come the charges don't work and everything and they said basically the way the ccs standard is written when we build our equipment when we write the software we can either follow the ccs standard or we could make the equipment work we can't do both what the hell is that so basically you've got all these companies missing uh operating and it's admit writing software that violates the standard because the way the standard is written it won't work properly so why keep pouring money into this alex when you can just say look instead of using that standard there's another one over here that works it works great it's smaller it's lighter it's easier it's more elegant for people to use and it's proven that it works let's just use that one i don't care who designed it okay i mean of course you don't care i don't care either i'm rooting for this but i'm trying to figure out how these other companies allowed this to happen and by the way let's talk about those who actually did was there kind of a full-time job you know let's talk about electrify america let's talk about evgo uh let's talk about chargepoint that hasn't really even tried it you know i i you know i know people poop on electrify america a lot and i have used them pretty much exclusively uh in the last what seven months since i was traveling through the united states and using them exclusively until now um and uh you know it worked it at the end of the day it pretty much worked out every time but they are a freaking mess uh it is i i it just tells me how unorganized and and bad they are at building which i think is really not something that's very hard to build they're not doing brain surgery it's pushing freaking electricity into cars and i get it i know you're gonna say well there's a lot of cars and there's just one of us and there's all the vendors but make it freaking work have a zoom meeting have a zoom meeting and make it work the change the standard doesn't make sense you know update the standards you know what i mean there could be a second version of the standard how could what what happened to all of that how is that even people whose full-time job was to to make it work and they couldn't explain that to me because there's too many people involved the one thing that the reason why tesla works so easy alex is they controlled everything the software the hardware the chargers the cars with ccs what you have is 40 different manufacturers all writing so their own proprietary software for the cars and then you've got 40 different charging station companies writing their own proprietary software then you've got an overlay of the payment systems the credit card readers you've got the networks electrify america evgo charge point with their own software for their apps and all this software has to work and talk together come on alex you can say come on it's true there's yeah i've seen them doing their testing and everything it's hard i get it i know it's very hard but you know what i mean there's no other industry that has this problem and i'm in bangkok right now right i'm gonna go downstairs to you know a a guy who's selling you know hot dogs on a little card or actually i'm gonna or scorpions i saw scorpions on the stick yesterday you know what i mean and i'm still going to be able to use my american credit card in this tiny little street in in the middle of bangkok in my car is rita is going to freaking work here in bangkok how's this electrify america not able to figure this out well you know the the payment systems that you're talking with have had decades to improve and refine and make the system work this is all new the election has been installing charges for what four years now and they've had to go through a whole bunch of different vendors because half of them didn't work and the equipment was changed now it's version two equipment this is such in such infancy this industry it's not surprising when you have so many people involved all writing software to try to coexist with each other different layers of software that there's a problem if if we were 30 years into making ev dc fast charges and it's still what marcus alex you're right but this is we're so early on and i get to i get the opportunity to talk to all these engineers and they explain it to me and i i honestly half the stuff they're telling me i don't even understand but they're showing me why there's interoperability issues why charging stations drop why credit card uh you know processors don't work and things that so i understand there's a lot to do here and when you when you see all of the problems and how it doesn't work and then you look over here and you're well that one works really well and our customers will be so much happier if we could just use that doesn't surprise me that ford exam said you know what let's just use that damn thing it works i i don't accept any of that but all right i made my case obviously it's not it doesn't matter america from they don't care but okay one last question uh you know i think that you know by the time this this might air even though a few days after we tape it do you think other other uh brands other car makers will follow will and if so i'm gonna assume you're gonna say yes but if so will there be a limit for example well it's going to be rough for german automakers to do that obviously but what about chinese automakers what about you know other small automakers do you think everyone's just gonna adopt it or do you think it's just only going to be north america only or europe only what do you think is going to happen in the next you know few months to a couple of years okay a couple of things here first off this is north america only just so you know this where this is not going to happen anywhere else all the other read there is no global standard you know in china china they used the gbt and they're going to supposed to transition to chowjoy connector japan is solid ccs they may go to chowjoy but i don't even believe they're gonna i think not ccs chadamo um uh the japan's going to be chadamo you know for for forever i believe because that's so really well they have so many stations in my mouth a little bit when you said that the entire country is blanketed with chadamo you can you you can't throw a rock and not hit a chathamo station in japan alex you can go anywhere you want maybe they should switch a lot of rocks well they should but in any event that's the way it is europe has ccs but it's ccs2 it's different than what we have here i know charmin likes to say it's a global standard it's ccs it's totally different than the ccs we have here in north america rccs is much worse than the ccs to have in europe and and tesla uses ccs2 in europe because of the fact that the the european union mandated that it had to be used there had to be one standard third so they did that and now everybody uses that here in north america to get to your final question yes i believe that that's it once ford and gm switched over it is a fate of complete nax is going to be the north american standard i don't know how long it's going to take the other oems to come out but you're gonna the dominoes are gonna start falling now alex one afternoon after another what does that mean ccs is going away no she just is going to be here for a while kind of chathamo is still here you know and there's just the leaf uses chadamo and there's still chatamo stations everywhere there's going to be legacy ccs stations all over the place but i think by the middle of this decade 2025 2026 most of the evs that the new evs produced are going to have uh the nax connector as their native connector and that's what they're going to be using is that when electrify america chargers are all going to work well once they will have to adopt this no that that won't fix it because it's still a software problem with their charges the the connector itself just makes it a more elegant solution they still have to then make the payment systems and the whole uh back end the software work better and who knows maybe tesla will get involved and help them figure out how to make the software work because it seems to work fine on the superchargers when they're testing when they're using other vehicles i charge my ford now it hasn't been perfect so i think some of the kia and hyundai group vehicles have had some interoperability issues on tesla stations with the magic dock but um if for the most part they seem to work and service other evs that came up and use the magic dock systems pretty well all right well we'll see what happens but uh i'm gonna go and get myself some street food here in bangkok and i am going to charge my android phone with a non-apple charger and i'm gonna pay with a credit card and and enjoy the technological wonders outside of of a mess that is the car industry and the street food here in bangkok was delicious and if you wanted to find out what kind of food tom eats you should to his youtube which i can easily tell you is the best place on social media to learn about ev charging and if you want to know the dramatic and sad ending to my two year ownership of the volkswagen id4 and why and how i got rid of it to check out this with some interesting clips other than that see you guys next time and remember to stay charged,3
E for Electric,PLXAbfWOvf5YtNes11pbNdgq3N5dbZg0Qy,xxpLykrmDA4,"we cannot talk about electric cars without talking about charging them as a matter of fact most people don't know much about charging electric cars even though it's probably the biggest part of what should be their decision about whether or not to buy one and which one to buy so today i'm going to show you all of the most important videos that i've made for you guys to know everything about electric car charging and specifically which chargers you should be considering for your electric car and the best part is this i'm actually going to have the best electric car charging expert in the world and this is not just my opinion tom mogy in pretty much every single giving his expert opinion about the subject so let's get going but before that a quick reminder that this is brought to you by energy pal are you thinking about going solar but not sure what panels to get whether or not to get a whole battery or how much all of this is going to cost well energy pal will do all of that for you and you will get a $500 gift card when your installation is complete if you use the link in the description of this all right so with that out of the way let's talk about the biggest problem uh that every electric car owner faces and we actually did this as a live uh so that will explain the format so here we go first of all you know electric cars are better than gas cars do i need to explain that they are faster the performance is better they are more environment friendly they're quieter the tech is better the self-driving technology is is going into the electric cars not the gas cars um they are safer because there's no engine there's a better crumbling zone it's got apps i we only have an hour so i'm going to stop right now but there's one there's one thing that electric cars unfortunately are lagging way behind uh gas cars and that is charging now gasing electric car is easy well not not cheap nowadays i see $7 a gallon i passed the gas station the other day it's insane uh but it is definitely easy and of course you get an added bonus of uh getting high from the gas fumes which i'm not going to lie i have missed that just a little bit but listen it takes three four five minutes to guess your car takes i mean obviously hours at home but with the fast charging networks uh it still takes about 30 45 minutes sometimes uh to charge a regular normal electric car when you are going long distance and unfortunately that's still an issue and let's talk about long distance first because when i got my very first tesla back in 2012 right and i showed it to my friends and i was oh guys look at this it's all electric it's got a good range it's got this big monitor and the app that comes along with it look at this marvel of technology that is 2012 tesla model s and the first and only question they would ask me is yeah but uh can you drive it to la and i'm when do you need to drive to la once a year how is this the first and only question but and unfortunately that still is one of the biggest questions when people ask when they're shopping for an electric car now the problem the needle has been moved right because most of the electric cars you're buying now or on the road they have more than 200 miles of range and more and more now have over 300 miles of range so you don't have to charge as often for example i live here in oakland and i go to santa cru once uh once a week and you know that's that's a long drive but i make it all the way there and still still buy a few friends houses and make it back on the same charge so and my car doesn't have the best range out there as a matter of fact it has half of the best range out there um and uh of course there are fast charging networks the biggest one the biggest public one here electrify america as a matter of fact i'm just about to use them a lot because uh i will be traveling i'm leaving california the end at the end of this month and i'll be traveling through the united states and if you guys still want me to make a about why i'm leaving california which is not very political um uh let me know i will make a it will have nothing to do with electric cars though so let me know i'll be happy to explain um there's also evo that's been expanding especially now that they have a partnership with general motors and of course tesla superchargers the largest uh infrastructure essentially for fast charging here in europe and in china but it looks here in america they will be open to all of us very soon because tesla wants that sweet money from that infrastructure bill and that infrastructure bill will fund a lot of you know infrastructure uh and and and thing even now you can pretty much travel anywhere in in america which i might uh in the next several months um so any additions will only enhance what we already have which is not bad however the biggest challenge that i've seen and this is not very common yet but i think it will be very soon unless it it grows and i've seen it in last time i visited tesla supercharger there was a line right you have to wait in order to wait to get your charge um and this was at in ville california not exactly a very popular charging location and it was a sunday afternoon but uh and i've seen those you know throughout the years and it's a problem but i the other day i've seen one under electrify america here in oakland california that's another problem that definitely needs to be solved and of course it's solvable by building more of these um however the other problem that's contributing to this one is the fact that people who are supposed to charge at home 99% of people should be charged in at home overnight every day uh are not uh and that's why they coming over to tesla superchargers electrify america and taking up the spots because they need to charge to go you know to work the next day uh and taking it away from people who are traveling so that's that's a problem but when it comes to charging 99% of you and i know some of you will say oh but i go to tahoe every weekend granted but for most of the people very much most of the time they should charge at home because uh it is not only convenient is not only much cheaper but it takes 7 seconds and i know you're saying alex what do you mean it takes hours and hours and hours what do you care what's happening when you're asleep the total amount of time that you need to put into getting your car fully charged overnight is about 7even seconds three seconds to plug it in four seconds to take it out and hang it back on the wall and you're done you're ready to go so uh it is the most convenient however that's not what's happening now if you own a house or if you're renting a house you know mo most people myself when i lived in my house i would put up a charging station or at least uh run a 240 outlet uh and even if you're renting and there is a there is a um electric dryer outlet you can use something you know neo charge they're one of the sponsors um you can get it plug it in as you can see on both sides you can charge either two cars or have your laundry done and charge your car uh no problem but where the challenge starts and i don't know tom has a very different opinion on this and of course uh he will make sure to let you guys know once he is on um uh when you renting an apartment that's a big problem i've had this problem throughout ever since i bought my very first uh electric car in 2012 and even this year when i was moving to from sacramento to oakland it was once again a challenge it was very few apartment complexes have dedicated charging spots that's what you need a dedicated charging spot they you can't just rely on one or two that just they have for common use because you don't want to gamble on whether or not you'll be able to pick pick up your kids from school the next day right you need a dedicated charger now the weird thing is that i finally found one and we had 20 spots i thought oh my god there would be 20 electric cars charging no uh half of the spots are taken by gas cars and the other half there's taken by electric cars are not even charging i think i'm one of two or three people who are charging their electric cars next to electric car charger in addition to that we have tons of people there's rivan and teslas and bolts that are just parked in regular spots and they never charge and granted some of them probably charge at work but a lot of them go out there and spend an hour two hours a week uh charging somewhere else and that is not a good experience uh for an electric car owner something that i think most regular common people and families are not willing to do to take another two or three hours away from their families and go in charge um and obviously it's just inconvenient for for those of us who don't have the ability now as i'm getting on the road i will be one of those people i'll definitely report back to you guys whether i it or not but i'm pretty sure i know uh the answer now at the same times we have not had too many laws around the country passed requiring ap apartment complexes to put up the electric car chargers which is a shame i think at most some counties pass laws where okay if you're building a new building next year up to 20% of the parking spots need to be um dedicated electric char but that's not going to do in another few years and what are we doing about the the the spots that all of the apartment complexes are already up um there's not much of a solution here and we need one now i promised you i told you that uh i will tell you about my favorite way uh to uh refuel your battery which is just as fast uh as as gessing a car which is a battery swap it's not very popular it's not very popular with you it's not very popular in the industry and it's definitely not very popular with tom who will let you know why in a second but neo as you're watching them right now has kind of pioneered and built out a pretty decent uh battery swap network in china uh and now launched it in europe we'll see how that goes over there and then there's a company called ample here in san francisco they've done it actually in a better way where they don't swap out the whole battery they just swap out one of the six modules which i think is the way to go for sure and of course cattle catl one of the biggest battery supply uh companies has launched their own series of batteries that are swappable and there's actually one model of electric cars in china that's already using that so we'll see if that takes off uh but that would be my choice because it is just very quick uh but bottom line is this when you're trying to implement a new technology into the masses that technology needs to be better and hopefully cheaper but definitely better than what people have right now and we're almost there but charging is definitely holding the entire thing back uh so now i think it's a good time to bring in my friend and the host of the stateof charge youtube and really the best expert i know in this industry uh tom mogy tom how are you doing my friend hey alex how's it going it's going pretty good well you know let's start off by uh talking about uh longdistance charging do you think we're finally at the point where long distance charging you know long distance traveling an electric car as long as it was purchased in the last few years or so uh is good enough to say okay we got it you can long distance travel in america and europe uh just fine so you know i think the point where we're at right now it's better than it's ever been it continues to get better i think for most road trips at least not all but for most road trips what we have today is adequate yeah and i think so i'm looking forward to it with mine now let's talk about home charging right obviously homeowners you and i were good uh and uh the problem of course is that most people rent and a lot of people live in in apartment complexes now i remember me and you had a lot of disagreements over this i think when um uh my ex-girlfriend asked me you know whether or not she should buy an electric car and i knew she was going to limit an apartment complex i said you know i hate to tell you this but you g probably just stick with a guess for now because you will have to go and consistently charge at a fast charging network um do you believe this is still a problem we need to solve yeah well we we still have inadequate infrastructure particularly for those that live in apartments and multif family dwellings that can't charge at home alex it's it's a problem it's not a problem that's insurmountable but where we are today it's still very inconvenient if you can't charge at home so what needs to change well i mean we you know there's no laws that i've seen that are being passed on on a larger scale and really that really going to make a dent in this how do we make the apartment complex uh managers and and owners to add these you know relatively expensive spots but i still feel it's something that you have to do sooner or later and with the infrastructure bill it should be a little bit easier on them financially how do we make it happen i i think it's pretty easy you st you stop renting from them if they don't provide it which is what's going to happen the market's going to work this out alex as more and more people get evs they're going to you know tell their their building manager the owner look we're moving out because we have an ev and you don't provide uh charging here and then when somebody is uh calling them to rent their apartment they're gonna ask them all about the apartment then say oh by the way i could charge my car there right no i can't oh okay forget it i'm gonna look somewhere else and then the the property managers are going to install charging they're going to have to or they're going to have empty units wow you are a real capitalist the market will work itself out david here has an interesting idea and i kind of agree with it let's see if you do uh he says so we need some ability to book some chargers with a monetary penalty for not using the booked charge time and suspended access for repeated no shows what do you think about that yeah i i i think it's a good idea i know charge point has uh in their app reserve charging uh in not all the locations they have the ability to do it but the site owner then is the one that ultimately decides if they want to initiate that or not uh i think that's a possibility coming up i think that would be good for the network because they could also pl see exactly what the utilization is and how many people get denied because they the that that station is booked and then that that might help them add more stations at the sites that need more plugs so yeah i think i think we're going to get to that point where you you'll be able to book you know you're you're in the middle of a road trip and you book a station that's 100 miles away you book it for two hours from now and you roll in right in the right time and uh and plug in and and and that plugs reserved for you only what do you think about uh if you're charging within uh i don't know five miles of your um address right obviously local should your rate be higher because you're essentially misusing the charging station no because what if you're live in an apartment and you need that charging station you know i mean i understand what you're saying there and you know in some use cases yeah if the person could charge somewhere else but um we can't penalize people that live in apartments and make them pay more that that wouldn't be fair all right here's another interesting one about uh you know battery swap pete says battery swap stations appear to be one car at a time what if there are two three four cars in line i might as well charge well no pete that's not how math works because the battery swap you know takes about two or three minutes nowadays and will improve even faster depending on how many sort of you know modules you want to replace so you know i the last time i was a tesla supercharger the line was about 20 minutes 25 minutes and when i got stalk in in line that was another uh the guy behind me waited for probably almost 30 minutes no if you have two three even four cars in line that's still going to be under 10 minutes of waiting versus what i've just described so that goes much faster and of course yes right now there's one at the time but the more cars they make the more demand there is then there will be two cars at a time you can assume that one technology is improving but the competing one is not and just standing still tom does that make sense yeah i i've i've i when i talked to neo about that um they had said i mean their stations are kind of they can drop them in place they just need the interconnection from the utility they said it was very easy for them to add another bay at the same location if the the um demand warranted it but you still can have a situation alex uh where pete mentioned where just the superchargers uh you know on usually there's never a backup but on a holiday a lot of people are traveling so now there's you know 10 cars in the queue waiting to get their three minute swap so um you know you're both kind of right there it definitely can happen uh but the but the the the the operators can also add additional bays if sites are continuously uh you know backed up and their mobile too um here's an interesting followup question from l y3t will battery swap cover you when your battery cannot hold a charge after years of use uh now correct me if i'm wrong tom uh that's a kind of a another perk of a battery swap is because the batteries are maintained by the company in this case neo or ample so they will always have a a a good battery if the battery you know seeing some degradation or just getting old that just goes right out of the circulation yeah that's you're correct alex um so there's no problem with that the comment said you you don't there's no your battery holding a charge if if when you get a when you swap out and get a new battery now that's your battery and uh uh what happens is the manufacturers in addition to charging the batteries they'll be tested at these battery swap stations and if the battery falls below a certain capacity they'll just get taken out of circulation so there'll be no such thing as having a battery that you know can't hold the charge if you're using battery swap yeah and to me it's one of the perks um all right let's go to another one uh from adam he he asks uh thoughts on airbnb of chargers companies ev watch or see charging in uk now we have one here called eveve matches a matter of fact i had their ceo on a while back where essentially yeah if you have a charger that's external or you can run a cable people come in and charge to me i i'm not really sure how that would work in in terms of you know if you're traveling long distance that's really the only time when you would need it and you know level two charging and that's the maximum that people can offer their houses and even businesses is just not fast enough unless it's an emergency do you agree with that tom is there is there any type of a airbnb uh you know way of of of of you know sort of contributing to the infrastructure yeah that there is actually you know you can limit the time when people when your charger is available you know and it it will lock itself out during the times you say it's not available so let's say for instance you work all day at an office so you're not home from 6: in the morning till 600 at night you know with your commute or whatever you could make your home charger available during those 12 hours and now somebody who lives down the block that lives in an apartment they p roll up to your house at at at 6 o'clock in the morning when you leave and they plug in and they leave their car there all day and they go walk home because they live a block away and they live in an apartment and now they're essentially using your uh charger while you know they're at home working and while you're at work so there is a business case for this and it can work yeah interesting i i haven't thought about that uh martin says evs with swappable batteries should be cheaper to buy than evs including a fixed battery well not only that but even leasing a battery uh should be cheaper than paying that extra money for the fixed battery because as i mentioned you shouldn't swap the entire battery you know if you're just going to the grocery store and to work you really need a very small part of your battery so you're dragging all of this charged battery cells that you're not going to use most of the time which actually decreases the range that the the module that actually will be used the module of battery cells that will be used uh because it has to drag another bunch of whatever 60 kilowatt 60 kilowatt hour battery with it um so that should be cheaper um you know tom do you see any issues with the math here no you're correct the the lease of the vehicle would be less but then you've got to pay whatever it is to lease the batteries or to or to join the battery swap uh system so you know it's i don't think long term i think if you were to net it out over five years you're not going to save any money because you still need use of a battery uh you know i i don't i don't think the financial saving would be worth it in my opinion all right in the next so tom is going to reveal five best electric home chargers on a budget and this is something that people do struggle with because you know they pay all this money up front for the car and then realize oh crap i i i need to spend more money on a home charger and this is where if you save you know sometimes you can get in trouble and we are talking about an electric device so these are the home electric home chargers on the budget that are still pretty good no you can't just buy the cheapest charger on amazon and call it a day it's one of those things when you cannot afford to buy cheap sh it is a high voltage electric device that can cause some big trouble including burning down your house but it doesn't mean you have to spend a fortune on it either so what to do what to do and what to do is to ask the best expert in the world in electric car charging tom mogy who is a veteran ev journalist and a host of the biggest ev charging on youtube appropriately named stateof charge now when i asked tom to come on and talk to us about the top five most affordable home chargers he told me that the minimum budget for anything he can vouch for would have to be around $500 all right fair enough tom let's talk about affordable home chargers but before we get to the list what makes an affordable but also good home charger so on the affordable alex you know there's if you look at the market now there's so many chargers out there that cost 600 700 $800 i took a look at $500 and less i consider that affordable because that's on the low end of a charger that is relatively high powerered uh level two charger what makes a charger good well there's a lot of things it it should be built well it should have a good warrantee it should um be safety certified it should have a nice long cable a good strong well-made connector and a nice connector holster there's a lot of things that i use when i judge if a charger is a good charger or not all right now i know you test almost all of them yourself and you put them literally through hell but the most entertaining part of your is what you call a deep freeze when you take the charger and put it in the freezer uh and leave it there overnight but uh you know humor me this uh what uh what is the good boy from new jersey yourself doing with a commercial ice cream freezer and what do you use it for when you're not testing home chargers so i actually bought this just to freeze the chargers um you know many freezers only go down to 0 de fah but commercial ice cream chests go way below that because ice cream has to be kept way below freezing otherwise it gets soft so i actually went out and bought a commercial ice cream freezer so i could do these cable deep freeze tests and the goal is for me to get the the charger down to about -5 degrees fahrenheit for 24 hours then to see how well the cable bends because this is really for people that live in the northern states alex if you live in san diego or southern texas you you don't have to worry about this too much but in areas where it's going to get down way below freezing overnight think about it if your vehicle's parked outside and your chargers out outside some people's chargers are mounted outside when you get to your car in the morning you go to unplug it and you've got a frozen rope and the cable won't even bend so i do this to see how pliable and how easy the cable's going to be to work with on those really cold nights every time you do it man it's always entertaining but let's get to the list and are these in any particular order no no i just threw out you know you you said give me give me some of your top picks for good chargers that are affordable and that's what i gave you all right let's get going with number one okay so number one we're going to talk about the grizzle e classic the grizzly classic is a 40 amp non-smart charger now there's chargers are smart chargers means they typically come with an app and they're wi-fi enabled and you can uh manipulate things through your app you can start and stop a charging session you could check out data uh but not a lot of people are really concerned with that some most people just want the charger to just charge their car and and that's it and be reliable and the grizzly does that it's it's very well made it's made of a it's it's got a really thick outer aluminum casing most chargers are plastic these days even though some of the plastic strong this uh this is an incredibly tough uh thing the grizzly actually drove over it with cars and everything to prove how tough it was uh and it's it's a really well-made uh charger uh it's got a nice long cable and it's kind of the non nonsense if you just want something that's going to be reliable and affordable and work then this is definitely one of your considerations all right now the next one is i i believe it's amazing e fast yeah so you know um the amazing e is a line of portable chargers they're small chargers they're portable from a clipper creek and uh so the amazing east is a 32 amp portable charger it's very small very lightweight you can carry it with you it plugs into an nema 1450 outlet it'll deliver uh up to uh 7.7 kilow and it's good uh for a portable charging unit now there are compet units out there on the market that cost less than this uh most of them are not safety certified most of them don't have good warrantees uh i this unit because it's really built tough and it's going to last a long time and i'd rather see people spend a couple dollars more but get a really good well-made product now this is a really good well-made product and it's available for around $400 and you know portable uh chargers you don't have to uh have it mounted on the wall and you wir it just requires a 240 outlet correct that's correct you know um i tend to recommend for your home charging use the charger you're going to use every day i to see that hardwired because it eliminates a point of failure an outlet is a point of failure but that doesn't work for everybody and what i about these portable units are is you can take them on the road for different places so you could charge at your house some people have second homes here in new jersey down the jersey shore or they have a a winter home up in vermont or connecticut and uh they had all they have to do is install an outlet there and plug in i have friends that have evs that installed outlets say at their parents house their parents live 80 miles away so they just had to install the outlet they didn't have to buy the charging equipment because they just unplug their charger and go to their parents house plug it in when they're there and then they can uh they have enough juice to get home all right now uh number three is the tesla mobile connector yeah so tesla makes outstanding charging equipment i i i almost think you know i love tesla vehicles i think tesla makes really good electric vehicles i almost think their charging equipment compared to other charging equipment is better than their cars are better compared to other evs tesla really makes good charging all of it uh and we're not going to talk about all of their chargers here today but two two out of the three so we talked about the mobile connector the tesla mobile connector is a dual voltage connector which means it can charge from 120 volt source regular household outlet here in north america or it can charge from a 240 volt outlet a nema 1450 outlet so uh depending on what type of outlet you have available you can use this on either uh supply and uh it's a very good small lightweight unit it comes with a 20 foot uh cable nice cable comes in a nice handy carrying case and for $230 is what tesla charges for this it's a ridiculously good deal um it's it's it maybe one of the best deals you can buy of any charging equipment out there today and does it only charge teslas or can you charge any electric car so out of the bag it'll only charge teslas because it has the tesla connector but you can buy a tesla to j1772 adapter and use it to charge any electric vehicle all right well the next one is the wool connector from tesla how is this one different again tesla so tesla's wall connector is their permanently mounted hardwired connector that gets mounted on your wall it's not portable um and uh it's 48 amps it can deliver uh up to 11.5 kilowatt which is a is is pretty much most electric vehicles top out at being able to accept 11.5 kwatt now some of the newer evs with really big batteries can accept uh up to 80 amp which is 19.2 kow but for all intents and purposes the the the 48 amp 11.5 chargers the tesla wall connector are pretty much as powerful as most people would need and uh tesla sells it for $425 it's a fantastic value um and again you can just buy that and then get an adapter uh to charge your uh j1772 vehicle tesla also sells a version of this with a j1772 connector but they charge gez i think it's it's $100 more so that pushed it up over $500 it's why it's not on this list here today but you can get uh the wall connector in charge any electric vehicle with it if you just buy an adapter all right uh the last but not least is emporia charger yeah so the emporia um charger is relatively new it's been out for about a year now i think maybe slightly more and honestly it's a fantastic charger at a fantastic price it's $3 $99 most comparable chargers on the market today that can do what the emporia can do uh cost at least $200 more it's a 48 amp charger um and it's a smart charger it has a w it has an app wi-fi connected and emporia sells a whole ecosystem of energy monitoring and energy saving devices and um for instance with this emporia charger if you buy what they call the emporia view or the view two i think it's called it's it's another piece of equipment you need to buy from emporia and you have solar electric you can use the two to only charge your ev from excess solar production so the solar that your house isn't using will trickle feed the battery on the on your car so you can say my car is only charged with solar electricity and and there's very few uh chargers out there that can do that uh so it's got a lot of options and at the price at the $3.99 it's just a sick deal honestly it it may be the best deal available out there today i mean the tesla wall connector is an awesome deal the tesla mobile connector is a fantastic deal but for a permanently mounted uh you know 48 amp charger to hang on the wall of your garage it's tough to beat the emporia these days all right well listen i got to ask you this one out of these five what would be your top pick you know alex that's i i'm such a nerd there's things i about each one of these chargers i love the fact that the tesla wall connector can they call it daisy chain and that means you can you can share one circuit and add a bunch of chargers so it have to be between the wall connector and the emporia tom they're not your children you can pick one it's okay come on they are my children look i know they are okay i'm i'm going to qualify if i owned a tesla i would probably get the wall connector if i owned any other electric vehicle probably the emporia all right now in the next tom reveals the five fastest home electric chargers for your ev but of course there is a caveat all right tom we are talking about fastest home chargers but before we dive into the list uh we need to talk about the elephant in the room here because what is a fast charger there is more to it than just the speed of the chargers we're going to be talking about out correct absolutely alex and first we are talking about home charging equipment there are dc fast chargers and super chargers out there that you can't buy for your house you know so we're talking about at home or bit or work charging that's number one number two you have to remember the car always dictates how much power it will take in so you have to know what the limit your car is and kind of match it to the charger that you're going to buy now we're going to talk today about the char chargers that can deliver the most power that you could buy for your home it doesn't mean your ev will be able to accept that much power some evs can especially some of the new evs with the really big batteries but uh always make sure you know how much power your ev can take in and we're going to now talk about the the chargers that can deliver the most power and i know that the top two that we're going to talk about first are bidirectional which is opens up a whole new universe so let's start with the ford one right so the ford charge station pro i actually have it here in my garage and i use it to charge my ford f-150 lightning it's a 80 amp charger it can deliver 19 kilow to the vehicle and uh it's bir directional as you said and that's because the lightning not only can accept power from the charge station pro but it can send power back to my house and i have uh it's called the intelligent backup power system i have that in installed also at the house so during a power outage my truck can power my house now the charge station pro the when it charges a vehicle it's different there's the the the charging gets done through some circuits and then the powering the house is completely separate so you actually need two feeds going to the charge station pro but it's a very powerful 80 amp charger and it can deliver up to 19 kilowatts to my lightning all right well the next one is from lucid and it is also bir directional but tell us a little bit about it but also compare the two a little bit if you don't mind so it's a the uh basically it's the same thing alex just in a different package it's an 80 amp charger um it's actually much more small and sleek than the charge station pro i don't have it yet but the good news is lucid just emailed me this week and said they're sending me one so i can do a review of it and i'll be able to really compare it side by side with the charge state pro um but it's bir directional it can deliver 80 amps to uh any electric vehicle that has a ccs uh plug um and it can also accept power from the electric vehicle the bad news is these early stage evs that can do bir directional power it doesn't appear that they're um they can do it with different equipment meaning by lightning can do it with the ford charge station pro but it won't be able to do it with the lucid charger and vice versa the lucid if i had a lucid air here i couldn't use it to send power to my house now both chargers can charge any electric vehicle the charging side is fine but when it takes power back from the vehicle where we are right now because this is all very new in the industry it's all proprietary information and you can't have one unit work with a bunch of different evs now before we get to the other ones let's talk about charging a tesla using these two can you and do you lose the speed at which you can charge a tesla with these two so teslas are currently limited to accepting only 48 amps which is 11.5 kilowatt so for me to charge a tesla on one of these chargers it wouldn't charge any faster than if i charged it from the emporia or the tesla wall connector because the car is going to limit how much power it takes in when tesla first started on the model s years ago they offered an option it was called dual on board chargers and it and those cars accepted 80 amps but after a few years tesla dropped that option and it's no longer available now i had one of those i think it was my 75d that had adm yeah i missed it a little but okay let's move on to the third one and it's a the clipper creek cs100 right so this is the original 80 amp charger the clipper creek this was the first first one to ever come out on the market this this unit's been available for 12 years alex before the model s even came out clipper creek's old school they're the original company in the us that were making electric vehicle charging equipment so it's a little bit more expensive both the ford charge station pro and the lucid charger are both cost around $12 $1,300 and uh the this clipper creek unit is over $2,000 uh it's it's a very good unit safety certified it's been on the market for many years it's it's tr true and tested it's very durable it's great for outdoor installations um but it is pretty expensive uh it's a good solid unit though all right well my my most favorite thing about the next two chargers are their names so let's get to the wadzilla uno so now we're getting a little bit out on the fringe you know there's not a lot of adm chargers available today um and we're talking about the wattzilla uno now wattzilla makes uh charging equipment they've been around for a few years and uh it's very industriall looking stainless steel it's not if you just looked at a picture of it you'd probably say oh that doesn't look it's a polished product but they've been around a while and they make good solid equipment it's safety certified energy star certified it's a good solid uh charger but again it's over $2,000 so it is expensive all right and the last but not least is what snap yeah the what snap is a brand new unit i haven't seen one in person i haven't used it yet but i did put it on the list because it's an 0 amp charger and there's very few adm chargers available it's brand new i'm probably going to try to get a hold of one at some point soon just to test it out but uh it is an option but again that one's over $2,000 i think it's $2,100 so it seems the ford and lucid with their lower prices the 12200 1300 i think they're catering to their customers and maybe selling them at cost but when these third party companies come out clipper creek wattzilla um what was it what uh i forget the name of it the last one what snap yeah i keep thinking what's app in my head and i know it's not called what's that it's a pwn on a pawn yeah and um i think they they need to build in a profit margin which is why they cost $2,000 these are expensive equipment all the contactors insides really thick connections that's why they cost so much more than the the lower uh powered chargers do but um you know if you have a an electric vehicle that can accept 80 amps you might want to consider getting one because uh it'll charge the car so much faster my lightning charges so much quicker when i use the charge station pro than when i use say the tesla wall connector now if le let's say i want my car to be charged as fast as possible while i'm asleep in my garage um where do i find out how fast does my car can charge uh and whether or not it can match the the char one of these charging stations that i either already have or thinking about buying so you know first of all your your dealer should be able to your salesperson should be able to tell you how much power the car can take in that's not always the case um the manufacturer websites always have that information um you know there's there's there's if you just do google searches i mean i'm uh i write for inside evs we go into detail on on on charging and how much power electric vehicles can take in because all electric vehicles have different power levels on what they can take in typically it's either uh 32 amps 40 amps 48 amps or now we have these new evs with bigger batteries i think gm is going to lean heavily into these 80 amp onboard chargers with their new uh products the silverado the hummer can't yet but next year it's going to be able to accept adms the cadillac lyrics going to be able to accept adms so um i expect cadillac to come out with their own branded adm charger soon but your best place is probably on the manufacturers website alex all right well and i got to ask you this out of these five which one would be tom's top pick well i own and use the charge station pro it's one of the lowest priced ones out of all i mean it's $7,800 less than the other ones except for the lucid the lucid's comparably priced right now i'd have to say charge station pro i love uh but i'll be getting the lucid in a week or so so maybe we'll have to revisit this and do a head-to-head comparison once i've had a chance to use the lucid charger for a while all right so the last that i'm going to show you is probably the most important because this is where tom reveals the best the best electric car chargers for your home but of course what's good for you is not necessarily what's good for me we're all very different electric car owners with different electric cars with different electric car needs luckily we have tom to explain all of these categories that a lot of people don't even know they fall into and what their choices of the best chargers are pay attention now i hate to tell you this but there is no such thing as the best electric car charger just there is no such thing as the best electric car or the best sushi restaurant it's different for everybody so instead of doing a top five common denominator best chargers for an average consumer list we're going to talk about best chargers in different categories the best home chargers on a budget the best smart home chargers the best tesla chargers and a few other categories that i'm sure you will be able to relate to but i'm not doing it alone i got the best guy in the business to help us out you know him as our weekly contributor he also contributes to forbes and inside evs but most importantly he is the host of his own youtube dedicated to home and fast charging of course i'm talking talking about tom mogy all right tom i would not dare make this without you because by far you the best expert in the industry if if anything your backdrop definitely showcases that so let's jump right in uh and you know before we get to the categories uh let's talk about a couple of things that people ask all the time one you know people call these chargers by the way and i know you corrected me and you said these are charging stations what is the difference so yeah i i know everybody calls them chargers but the technical term is actually evse electric vehicle supply equipment that's because the charger is built into every electric car every electric car has what's called an onboard charger that's the device that actually charges the car these evsc or charging stations just supply energy to the vehicle safely they're really just glorified safety devices alex all right and that brings me to another question uh which is you know we decided not to have a category of the fastest charger because everybody wants to charge their cars as fast as possible why can't we talk about what which which charger is the fastest so you asked me about that let's do the fastest charging station and the reason why i kind of said i don't think that's a good way to go was because the car always dictates how fast it charges on ac level two charging uh so you know there is plenty of charging stations that can deliver up to 48 amps which is really the maximum that any ev can accept today so it's not really fair to to to to pick one of those because there's a bunch of them available on the market that can deliver up to 48 amps all right and that brings me the another question that i asked pretty often i'm sure you as well is well why can't i mean my car can charge at the supercharger or electrify america very very fast so why can't i do it at home okay cuz there's two different types of charging there's ac which is alternating current and dc direct current charging at home level one charging is a regular household outlet that's 120 volts level two charging is 240 volts which is behind me now energy is stored in a battery as uh direct current dc so when you charge a car from ac either level one or level two it has to be converted to dc that's basically what the onboard charger does so imagine the electricity coming from these units has to go through the onboard charger it converts it to dc direct current and stores it in the battery so that's why the onboard charger is the bottleneck it restricts how fast the car can charge when you charge dc fast charging or supercharging you you take energy directly from that charging station and it goes right into the battery it doesn't have to go through the onboard charger so it's not restricted so that way the the battery can accept a lot more energy and charge a lot faster all right so now i feel we're ready to jump into the categories in the first category is the best smart home charging station yeah so you know a i'd to point out first that these are my opinions there's there's a few really good ones on the market so i'm going to tell you which one's my favorite and then mention a couple other ones that are really close that i think are great deals also my my favorite smart charger is the nlx juice box uh it has more smart charging features than than any other smart charger we talk about smart chargers are chargers that are wi-fi enabled they come with an app you can uh view your past charging sessions sometimes you can adjust the current you could schedule it to charge from your app you can see you know how long the car has been charging how much energy it took in many of them you can even uh pair with amazon alexa or google home and say say hey uh you know uh alexa charge my car and the car starts charging uh you could say hey uh you know alexa uh how long is my carbon charging and it'll tell you so it has a lot of smart charging features but the juice box also allows you to pair your charger with your local utility and through a service called juice neck green charge your car when the most uh cleanest energy is available during the day so that's important for a lot of ev drivers they want to be clean they want their car to be zero emissions the juice box is one of the only uh chargers that allows you to actually select when you charge your car based on how clean the grid is honorable mentions go to the wallbox pulsar plus and also the charge point home flexed they're also two very good smart chargers let's move on to the next category which is the best value okay that one should be pretty quick the grizzle e here 40 amp grizzle e classic i think it's the best value for a charger it's a dumb charger it's not a smart charger so it doesn't pair with a w with wi-fi you can't select an app um that version is coming out but for now the classic is just the way it is it's a 40 amp charger it's built really tough uh it has adjustable power so you can set it to deliver the power that you want based on what your circuit can supply and uh up until very recently it only cost $399 now it recently jumped up to $459 i don't know if that's a permanent price increase uh i think it could be temporary because of the shortage with uh you know semiconductor chips and so forth but even at$ 459 it's a great value and that's my best value choice and now we come to the category that obviously dictates itself within the entire electric car community we're going to talk about specific chargers for tesla drivers it is its own category yeah and you have to do this alex because there are so many tesla sold i mean teslas account for i i i forget what the exact percentage is something 75% of all evs in in the us uh so you know we we had to give them their own category and the re another reason why is because they have their own connector tesla uses a different connector than all of the other uh electric vehicles in north america uh they use uh their tesla proprietary connector every other electric vehicle uses this the j1772 so for tesla owners i think it's particularly important that they get in my opinion the best choice is the tesla wall connector it's at a good price it's it delivers up to 48 amps uh and it has the tesla connector standard so you don't need an adapter you could use one of the other charging stations to charge your tesla uh with the adapter that's provided by tesla tesla when when you when uh when you buy your tesla it comes with the car so you could use any of these but there's no need to to use this for daily charging when tesla has such a good solution i think it's best off to just buy the tesla wall connector now the adapter you just showed that's so uh the tesla uh uh charger can uh uh charge a different car or that the non- tesla charger can draw charge the tesla car so what comes free with your car is this adapter that allows you to charge your tesla with with another charging station let's say you already had one at your house you you didn't want to buy another one tesla gives you this for free good on them um but let's say you already own a tesla so you have a tesla wall connector in your garage and now you buy a mustang maki or id4 or any other electric vehicle you say gez i got to go out and get another charging station you know because it has a different connector you don't have to you can buy one of these adapters it's a tesla to j7 1772 adapter um this is a nice uh tesla tap mini one of my favorite ones and this one's just the tesla tap uh but the one thing i need to point out this is super important there's a lot of very cheap uh units of these available today on amazon that are not made well they burn out um make sure you get a good quality made one don't go buying the cheapest one that's available it's going to melt the connectors the pins are going to burn out get one that matches the amperage of your car if you have a car that can accept 40 amps make sure you get one that can deliver at least 50 amps oversize it a little bit because i've seen so many nightmare stories of people melting cheap connectors and then damaging their car all right so our next category is portable charging stations what would you call them and what are they so i just called them uh either evsc or portable charging equipment and what that is are the smaller units this amazing e that we have here that you would carry around with you in your car a lot of people to have charging equipment in the back of their ev case they need to plug in on the road some evs come with a nice uh portable evsc a level two unit that can charge the car relatively quickly but some cars come with very weak charging equipment as standard a level one unit that trickle charges you only get about 3 or four miles of range per hour and those owners prefer to go out and buy a nice level two charging unit my favorite are the two from uh amazing e the amazing e 16 amp portable charging unit and also the amazing e fast which is a 32 amp unit um why do i amazing e the they're super quality that's what i really about amazing e more so than uh some of the other portable charging equipment you can find them on amazon there's dozens of them many from companies you've never heard of a lot of them being imported from asia with 30-day or 60-day warranties uh they're not safety certified they're really not safe to use these units here cost a little more i'll be right up front with you but they're solid units with really good warranties and they're safe you you know you just spent 3040 $50,000 on this brand new ev and now you're trying to save $50 on the charging equipment it really doesn't make sense buy a nice quality unit and it will last you a long time and you won't have any problems with the connectors melting or plugs burning out get a good solid unit and you won't regret that decision all right now the the next category is outdoor charging stations because i think it's easy to assume when we talk about home charging it's always inside the garage but a lot of people either don't use their garage or don't have a garage so this is something that is kind of a whole different animal that has to weather literally weather the storm yeah so there's there's a lot of different aspects in charging equipment and if you're going to buy one to mount it outside there's a few more things that you need to look at uh how well the the cable is if you live in a cold weather area how does that hold up in really frigid cold weathers does it remain nice and bendable and pliable or does it get a frozen rope and you can't even bend it the the unit also you need to know what the nema waterproof rating is some of these units are have better uh nema ratings if you're going to mount your unit outside and you live in an area where it frequently rains or snows you should look for a nema 4 rated unit um the units that i think that are the best for outdoor are clipper creek products clipper creek makes absolutely fantastic products the mo some of the most durable products they've been around forever cl clipper creek they're the og of ev charging stations uh and their units are some of the most robust units of available honorable mention goes to the grizzle e uh that's also a super tough unit this thing can withstand just about anything and also the flow uh g5 or x5 uh both of these units are made really well there're they're metal incas uh enclosure super tough and uh these three units here in my opinion are the best if you're going to mount them outside and use an outdoor charging solution all right this is is the best information that i believe you need to have in order to buy an electric car or buy an electric car home charger for your existing one so i hope you were paying attention i said tom is simply the best so i would absolutely pay attention to his advice all right looking forward to all of your comments other than that see you guys next time and remember to stay charged",1
